i 'm writing this because i somehow felt being led to believe dark remains was a good movie . whilst it 's not the worst i 've seen , it certainly is n't good . a weak script , weak actors , and weak directing . even if they ca n't afford big name cast , would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress ? it was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance . the story was a cliché and poorly scripted . the special effects were minimal . the `` suspense '' tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow . to be fair , dark remains is no worse than quite some of the masters of horrors ' episodes . but not quite on par with quality movies yet . dark remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who do n't want to miss any movie in the genre , even if it 's a poorly made one . as for anyone else , time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy .
i 'm not a huge freddy krueger fan , but that does n't mean that i do n't like robert englund and his other nightmare on elm street movies.i think that robert is a very good actor.nobody plays a better freddy krueger than he does.but , no offense robert , this movie sucked.the acting is terrible , the plot is really weak , and freddy krueger is the only part of the cast that 's even worth watching.sometimes sequels can be better than the first , such as the friday the 13th franchise ( i thought the remake was the best in the series . ) but this is n't one of those movies.the original was good , the 2nd in my opinion was better , the 3rd was okay but i haven , t seen the others.whatever you do , don , t make the same mistake i did by watching this piece of crap .
`` horrible people '' ought to be the subtitle of this horrible film . if you want to see ordinary people doing ordinary things , then look out of your window at real life . but if you want to see unpleasant people doing dull things , you 'll have to watch this horrible film by mike leigh . the characters talk at length , but never actually manage to communicate with each other . why not ? presumably because leigh things that all of us are as ineffective and pathetic as his actors , and he wants to film real life . but we 're not , and he failed .
i recently watched the first guinea pig film , the devil 's experiment , and i must admit to being disappointed . this film is invariably included in any list of the `` nastiest '' films and maybe i was expecting more because of the hype . the truth is though , i do n't rate it . if i 'd been watching it believing the opening text to be true ( `` i found this tape ... '' ) , i might have been a bit disturbed by it , thinking it was real . even without the benefit of knowing it not to be real though , i think i 'd have worked out that it indeed was n't . throughout the film , the girl 's reactions to what is being done to her just are n't what they should be . she should be screaming like a banshee in pain . the fact that she is n't means that it 's obviously not real . i would n't want to watch it if it were real but if she were to be more convincing in her acting , the film would be more disturbing . and then there are the notorious scenes : nothing affected me at all up until the scalpel in the hand . the hot oil , maggots and innards just did n't bother me . i 'm not saying i 'm `` hard '' ; just that i was n't able to suspend my disbelief , partly because of the girl 's inaction . the scalpel made me wince a little but the hammer to the hand just made the hand look rubber . and the final scene with the eye was again a little wincing but nothing more . i did n't want to look away and neither did i feel nauseous . perhaps it 's because the film is twenty-odd years old , or perhaps i 'm just jaded . the truth is , i did n't find this film at all disturbing . it 's the kind of thing you might expect to see playing on a loop as a modern art installation and as an exercise in stripping away characters , story etc . and just leaving the torture , it works on some levels . as a disturbing piece of film though , it did n't work for me at least . i watched guinea pig with my wife , who is of the `` it 's just a film '' bent and she wondered what all the fuss was about . we got to discussing why i watch these films and my reasons are many but include a desire to be affected by a film . she said that she did n't think any film could be so convincing as to disturb her and challenged me to do exactly that . i played her the fire extinguisher scene from irreversible and she was indeed disturbed . i 'm not sure i have a point , other than that both of us were more disturbed by a scene in a non-horror genre film than any film thus far which sets out to disturb .
this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the `` night gallery '' show back in 1971 . the episode starred sue lyon ( of lolita movie fame ) and joseph campanella who play a baby sitter and a vampire , respectively . the vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child ( which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster ) while he goes out at night for blood . the baby sitter is totally oblivious to the vampire 's appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror , has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult , and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child . she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally . she bolts out the door , the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over . i do n't know what purpose it was to make such an abbreviated episode that lasted just 5 minutes . they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and skipped this one . a total wasted effort .
a typical 70s italian coming of age film , original and good music , but with some quirks , interesting but not fantastic photography , poor and at times confused storyline ( e.g . the role of the wolf-dog , and where does the boy come from ? ) with poor dialogue , nice ambiance . the reason it is still ( relatively ) well-known and sought after is probably the nude scenes ( including typical 70s pseudo-coitus ) involving an 11 and 13 year old girl with an older teenage boy ( eva ionesco and laura wendel ) - it is interesting from a socio-political point of view to see how these representations of very young adolescents was considered acceptable and normal in the whole of europe ( and us ) 30 years ago , whereas now it is more than taboo . the story revolves round bullying of one girl ( laura ) by the other two characters , and her discovery of sex , a quite accurate representation of an aspect teenage life . the character of eva ( silvia ) does not evolve to the very end of the film and already appears very versed in the erotic arts - there is no `` coming of age '' for her : she is a very vain young girl who is already aware of her sexual charms , but ultimately is just used and ends the film crying like the little girl she really still is . the boy is an utterly despicable bully , while laura comes across as a very naive and weak victim .
i admit the problem i have with the much-celebrated ealing films i 've seen so far could be mine . to my taste , either they are black and rippingly funny , or so light in tone to be unsatisfying as comedies or stories . that 's a self-important way of saying i wanted to like `` the man in the white suit '' but found myself struggling to sit through its short run time . textile worker sidney stratton ( alec guinness ) may be meek in manner , but he is doggedly committed to progress in the form of his attempts to invent a strand of fabric that ca n't be broken or made dirty . using a factory lab for his latest experiment , he toils against limitations both material and human - the latter being the benighted mill bosses who do n't understand what he is up to , then figure it out and become even more committed to stopping him . `` it 's small minds like yours that stand in the way of progress , '' sidney complains , practicing in the mirror what he struggles to say to the man . one problem with `` man in the white suit '' is that sidney 's vision of progress is awfully small-minded , too , more so even than that of the bosses or the laborers who also resent his work . my problem is more elemental : for a comedy , `` white suit '' is not funny . it 's a rather earnest script which too often tries to mine its feeble attempts at humor from spit-takes , double-takes , triple-takes , and dizzy takes . the best joke is the sound of the machine sidney toils at , going `` bleep-blop-bleep-bop '' endlessly and fetching queer looks from every visitor until sidney either extracts his miracle from it or blows it up trying . like every other bit of stray humor that functions decently in this film , it 's leaned on too long . i 've never seen guinness less affecting in a movie , even though he looks impossibly young and earnest ( though actually in his mid-30s ) . he seems so bloodless , even more so than the wax-faced general he played in `` doctor zhivago '' he 's the same cold fish whether he 's ignoring the sad affections of the affecting mill girl who offers to give him her life savings when he loses his job ( pan-faced vida hope as bertha ) or the more sultry charms of young daphne birnley ( joan greenwood ) , his one real ally in his fight against `` shabbiness and dirt '' , as she puts it , making those words sound as impossibly sexy as only greenwood could . supporting players make `` white suit '' work as well as it does . ernest thesinger of `` bride of frankenstein '' fame plays a singularly nasty captain of industry who looks like nosferatu and makes a laugh like a death rattle . howard marion-crawford as another factory leader is as memorable here as he was playing a blinkered medical officer in `` lawrence of arabia '' . then there 's the undeniable charm of mandy miller as a little girl who steals her few moments on camera right from under everyone else . but most of the scenes are played so straight that one would n't think director alexander mackendrick had ever worked on a comedy before ( his previous ealing comedy `` whisky galore '' does n't reverse that impression , alas ) . roger macdougall 's play posits the notion of scientific progress as potential disaster , but fails to present dull sidney in anything other than the most blandly pleasant of lights . ealing comedies are remembered for capturing the human side of comedy . yet the ealings i 've seen never seem to do this , working only when they play aggressively against our own sympathies . `` kind hearts and coronets '' and `` the ladykillers '' ( mackendrick again , go figure ) are classics this way . `` white suit '' , on the other hand , is a pointless ramble that falls apart when it should cohere , just like that unfortunate suit .
i read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end . however , when i saw the movie i was very disappointed . first of all , no disrespect to deborah raffin but she was too mature to play a woman of 24/25 . the late christopher reeve was also miscast-same reason . will , according to the book , was around 30 . i would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life , his friend red , elly 's trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters ' storyline development . also miss beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a plus size lady . i know the movie did n't have the budget of the `` bridges of madison county '' which i believe was released around the same time . but to me this was a very poorly made , low budget , miscast movie . as someone mentioned , i wish that miss spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be . she knows her characters better than anyone , i hope that she would consider doing the casting too . the movie let me down !
first of all , yes , animals have emotions . if you did n't know that already , then i believe you are a moron . but let 's assume that none of us are morons . we all know that animals have emotions , and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature , correct ? what we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are `` human '' . the filmmakers search high & low for footage of animals engaged in human-like behaviour , and when it happens they say , `` that monkey is almost human ! '' ( that 's actually a direct quote ) . everything is in human terms . they waste time theorizing about what makes dogs `` smile '' , but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means . the arrogance of these researchers is disgusting . they even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat . i had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms . i wanted to learn how animals emote in their own languages . but instead , researchers keep falling back on pedantic , anthropomorphic observations and assumptions . add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps `` celebrating christmas '' , and this was enough to turn my stomach . but it does n't end there . half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities . all the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars , and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages . one particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning ( though you have to be quick to notice it ) where a captive monkey says in sign language , `` want out . hurry go . '' obscure references are made to `` stress tests '' and psychological experiments which i shudder to imagine . baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a `` mother figure '' . and after 40 years of experiments , the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion : monkeys have emotions . one chimp named `` washoe '' has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose , and to this day she remains thus . we get a brief glimpse ( again through bars ) of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression . personally , i do n't need to see any further experimental data . washoe , i apologize for our entire species .
i do n't know what it is about donald sutherland 's acting style , or vocal style , but he always seems to be acting from behind a massive wad of soggy kleenex . he 's just ... i do n't know , thick ? somnambulistic ? on meds ? weird . that said , i just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release , and frankly , i do n't remember it ending anything like that . a bad ending , too , because nothing gets tied off . what about the dead husband ? the annoying child ( and was the kid dubbed ? ) ? the scotland yard and military pursuers ? i would have liked something wrapping things up and giving some dramatic closure to it all , not just the big panoramic pull-away . and what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband ? even if she was trying to allay needle 's suspicions to protect her kid , she could always have had a headache . that last encounter made me feel way too itchy and uncomfortable ...
my roommates & i nearly shorted out our tv from the numerous spit-takes we did while watching this hilarious piece of 1970s self important pseudo-zen dreck . i 'd read about this campfest for ages and scanned my local late night tv listings for years in search of this elusive turd . several years ago our local abc affiliate was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick ( ie `` frogs '' , `` night of the lepus '' , etc ) . then one day it happened : at 1:40am on a saturday night ( over 5 years ago ) there it was ! we had over 15 folks over and the flick did not disappoint ! see ! andy griffith as the silliest & most unthreatening bad guy since jaye davidson in `` stargate '' ! see ! william shatner sport a variety of things atop his head that only faintly resemble human hair ( or anything organic for that matter ) . hear ! jaw droppingly inane 1970s psychobabble that makes `` chicken soup for the soul '' sound like bf skinner feel ! content that any decade was better than the 70s . for those still reading ... the plot surrounds a bunch of middle class mid level a -- holes who decide to suck up to their s -- -head boss ( griffith ) by joining him on a cross dessert race that spans california & mexico . they all wear leather jackets , looking more christopher street than anything else . along the way they stop at a cantina , get drunk , smoke joints ( the sight robert `` mike brady '' reed smoke a joint is an image you wo n't soon forget ) , start a fight , attempt rape , and just act like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs . although i have an excellent copy that i taped off tv i wish this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked goofiness .
i have never seen a movie as bad as this . it is meant to be a `` fun '' movie , but the only joke is at the start , and it is not funny . if you like this sort of movie , then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2 . if it had the necessary votes , it would truly belong on the bottom 100 .
bad movie . it´s too complicated for young children and too childish for grown-ups . i just saw it because i´m a robin williams fan and i was very disappointed . (
hm . while an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes , point out atrocious acting , primitive ( at best ) special effects ( all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years ) , severed ranks among the worst i 've ever seen . i 'm never sure who the protagonists are , all i know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine , as seen in the dance floor murder scene . all in all , i do n't really like the movie , because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable , the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion ( which i ca n't remember anyway ) .
redline is a knockoff of fast & furious , without any of the redeeming qualities . it does n't need to have a convoluted plot with multiple twists and surprises , but it needs something ! this is the equivalent of a porn film , where the storyline and dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end . except that this is worse , because you do n't get your money 's worth . mind-numbingly boring , impossible race sequences , and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars , which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie . sure , she 's hot , but who 's that desperate for an on screen female ? i feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets , and shook an 8 ball every time they switched scenes . no serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes .
let me start out by saying i can enjoy just about any bad italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970 's . seriously . this one was downright awful . there are way too many elements that martino tries to inject and none of them work ( except for the croc-gone-wild thing ) very well at all . there are some ignorant westerners , of course , who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere . i do n't even remember where it takes place ... how sad is that ... basically , people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its ' ceremonies but eventually they upset the 'alligator god ' of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage , killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well . sounds good , yeah ? well , do n't get your hopes up . there is minimal violence until the end , the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughable . there is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator , like a dart , into the water and that is supposed to be the gator attacking . i 'm not kidding . in another wonderfully crafted special effect , a matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator , who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van . ( a few minutes ago , he was only big enough to eat a human , but now he dwarfs a full-size cargo van ... ) it is really pathetic . the only other flick i can think of where the effects were so bad i was pulled out of the story was bruno mattei 's masterpiece , `` rats , '' what with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who could n't be terrified . normally i 'd say anything sergio martino was a solid must-see but this one is a must-pass . waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the $ 15+ sticker price from no shame . this one is a shame . 2 out of 10 , kids .
this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies . two harbors is a b & w 75 minute film from minnesota that features non-actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life . i applaud the boldness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking out-of-the-box when selecting this film . i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with . as a matter of fact , i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself ( not that two harbors is completely without merit , but i 'll get to that a little later ) . as is common with independent films , two harbors is limited in terms of location . there are only two real locations  a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer , which is the home of the middle-aged main character , vic , played by alex cole . writer/director james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic , who is one of the dealers there . he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  vic sells space toys ( he prefers to call them `` outer space action figures '' ) and he is a caustic asshole . this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors - all the chatting . i 've said it before and i 'll say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually . there are exceptions , of course , but generally , endless patter is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition . pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose . a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store . he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes do n't even advance the plot one iota . this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long . the other problem with two harbors is the acting . i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film , but i really do n't feel like there 's a good excuse for not having good actors in your films . there are plenty of good actors out there , many of which willing to work on low-budget projects  even in minnesota . many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals , but that is naïve . in narrative film-making , next to the story , nothing is more important than the acting/performances . if you do n't believe the people enacting your story , your audience is lost . originally , i thought vculek was using non-actors , but as the film went on , i decided that they were probably community theater-type actors . it was n't that they were uncomfortable on camera . it 's that they were overly theatrical ( i.e . big ) . granted , the best of the actors were the two leads  cole and catherine e. johnson as cassie , a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vic 's extra-terrestrial hunt . they seemed to have the most training , but they were still a little rough around the edges . the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only - not coming from a real , organic place within . ms. johnson , in particular , is an interesting case . she definitely has a presence  a midwestern charm about her , but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have . she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and ( slave ? ) labor , relying on stock gestures like eye rolls , lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world . i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and here 's what i mean . without giving too much away , there is a fade to white an hour into the film . after that , the story takes a stunning turn , which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful  it 's like a sucker punch to the gut , but in a good way . it 's almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters . the last five minutes of the film do n't have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle , detailed ( cole does his best work of the film ) and most importantly , cinematic . then , with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all  that it 's based on a true story , which got me to thinking . with all the dialogue , the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities , it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re-write , two harbors might make a really kick-ass stage play  maybe even a one-act . if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this , i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker , reel 13 or whomever . there might be something to this story after all ( for more information on this or any other reel 13 film , check out their website at www.reel13.org )
space camp , which had the unfortunate luck to be planned around the time of the challenger accident , deserves such luck . the `` stars '' make a mockery of acting , lea thomson actually being turned sideways , when asked for more than her usual wide-eyed innocent smile , presumably to mask her risible attempts . the movie is at times hilarious , when it begins to ask far too much of you . a small boy keeps a multi-million dollar robot in his closet which breaks when given too many commands by the hordes of cliched dorm-mates . this hackneyed and unlovable machine , `` jinx '' , is a major player in the ridiculous premise of the movie , which seems part short circuit , part 2001 by the airplane team . i sha n't bore you with this , suffice it to say you can only laugh when faced with it . having said all of this , it is enjoyable to watch , in a seaquest , saved by the bell kind of way . the romance and technology , beware , are as unbelievable as each other . also , if you 're an eighties freak , its unmissable for the amusing performances of kate capshaw ( willie from temple of doom ) and , obviously , lea thompson . also , joaquin phoenix puts in a dodgy turn as a sort of wannabe goonie who befriends jinx . do not go near this movie if you are not a fan of trash .
it is not obvious from viewing this film ( so i recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it ) but this presentation on the realities of islam , and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-muslims is lacking objectiveness , and also completely fails to factor in the human condition . it is one thing to document that the koran says many things about how a devout muslim is required to interact with non-muslims , but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of islam , will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system . there is reason to call much about the presenters into question , such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism ; do n't swallow it all , hook , line , and sinker , without some thinking of your own . one specific , for instance , is researching the person walid shoebat ; who claims to be a former muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in bethlehem . there are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions . i am not nor have i ever been a muslim . i have never read the koran . i am not a christian , nor a member of _any_ faith . but i am an intelligent and discerning human . while the film is quite disturbing , in its presentation of how some muslims view their obligation to islam ; i remind you that there is more to islam than the views of the fundamentalists . just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical christians , so , too , there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among jews and muslims . when you watch this film , you need to have the salt shaker on hand . one grain will not be enough , you 'll need more . please use your own mind and think for yourself , research what is presented , and evaluate the state of the world and how islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video . there is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together , indicating a definite bias . be your own brain .
this is one of the worst things to ever come out of england , so that says a lot right there . the tension when we have to find out whether or not lembach is staying is amazing though . the upside is seeing the nice secretary , sheila , in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by dr. rat face . this movie has several views of london too although none of them are good . there is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal . there is also a watch that gets teleported away , and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of `` the sixth sense '' only a lot more dull and british . add on a furious gun fight between the british police and the dr. rat , which results in nothing , plus the electrocuting of a lot of people , plus a cat and you have yourself ... ummm ... a british movie . the mst3k version is pretty good although not one of there bests .
may contain spoilers ! ! ! ! so i watched this movie last night on lmn ( lifetime movie network ) which is not known for showing quality movies . this movie is awful ! i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing , as it was terrible . could this movie contain any more stereotypes ? ( harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor , catholic family with priest sons , big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family 's house , mexican whores , `` bad '' guy who is really a softie at heart , incredibly bad country accents ) gag ! ! ! ! i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it , i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it . anyway , the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick 's beauty . i suppose pollack 's and nemec 's acting is okay , but they have a horrid script to work with . unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents ( the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang ) i think that the accents were there ( in supporting characters like mary margaret 's date and john ) and were unnecessary . they were also very very bad . i am so very tired of hollywood `` southern '' accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from . and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive , i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town : the beautiful capitol building , the ut tower lit up for a winning football game , etc . none of these things were there . also , it takes about 5-6 hours to drive to mexico from austin . at one point in the movie , michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark ( during the summer and early fall it does n't get dark in austin until 9pm or so ) , spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican ( is there any other kind ? ) whores , and then return to austin by dawn . while this is theoretically possible it is not very likely . and if anyone has started school in the hill country ( usually the third week of august , but may have been in september in 1960 ) they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they do not wear their letter jackets ! ! ! ! ! in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90+ degrees . only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school . all in all , a very bad made for tv movie experience .
i have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago . and i have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching . supposedly a movie had been made in the past , but i 'd never been able to locate it . well , my students and i were all so excited when we heard that disney had brought madeline l'engle 's excellent book to the screen . as i watched the movie , i had the highest of hopes . as the film went on , i became more and more despondent . they had botched it badly ! never had i been so let down by a favorite book-to-film adaption . i understand that films ca n't stick strictly to a book , but they do n't need to change things for the sake of it ! most , if not all , of departures from the book were totally unnecessary ! i kept my opinion to myself at first and just listened to my students discuss the movie . well , it was n't just me . nearly every single one felt the same way -- cheated out of the great story that madeline l'engle had so skillfully created ! why , they wondered , did aunt beast look like chewbacca from the star wars movie ? why could n't calvin 's hair have been red ? why did mrs . which not have the proper `` witch-like '' outfit that was such a clever play on her name ? basically , we all wondered -- why did nearly every single detail have to be changed ? i have always dreamed of how wonderful a movie this book would make . i am still waiting for that movie . this one was a wrinkle in time in only the broadest of senses . i 'm going to write to peter jackson and try to convince him to take on the task !
thank g_d it bombed , or we might get treated to such delights as `` skate fu '' where we can see the likes of brian boitano performing a triple lutz & slashing bad guys to ribbons with his razor-sharp skates , but i digress . one thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little t & a from ms. agbayani . it 's not like the world would have seen anything new ( at least that part of the world who saw her playboy spread . ) i truly believe that porn would have suited her 'talents ' much better , although aubrey hepburn could n't have stayed afloat in this sewer . one explanation for kurt thomas ' presence could be a traumatic brain injury , possibly from coming up short too often on dismounts . it 's a good thing the ioc was n't as diligent on 'doping ' as they are now , or kurt would surely have been stripped of his medals . to be avoided at all costs .
an average tv movie quality , totally formula story of religious fanatic ( ron perlman , who gives good `` i 'm not just the president of 'psychos r us , ' i 'm also a client . '' ) who gets control of a biochemical virus ( think the virus from the movie `` the rock '' ) . too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and the government agents trying to stop him ( led by the impressively physiqued , mildly entertaining wolf larson , backed by fred dryer ) along with the standard `` in the wrong place at the wrong time '' spunky female ( the forever bland erika eleniak ) and `` lived as a wimp but died as a hero at the last minute '' male ( brandon karrer ) . has the standard background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic ( wife and son killed in a police raid a few years previous ) . basically a decent rainy day movie . favorite line , spoken by ron perlman after he finds the vial of the virus hidden in erika eleniak 's cleavage : `` a woman and her mystery . '' worth a rent .
having the in-laws over for the weekend ? then this is the film to hasten their departure , failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant nagging . the film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship , which is more superannuated car ferry ; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity d list . an interesting piece of added amusement is playing `` spot the villain '' as passengers join the ship . you wo n't be wrong ! ! ! ! with a script that sinks faster than a brick , clichéd set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller , action movie and gore-fest and simultaneously fails to fulfil any of them . a must watch film , if only to laugh at how bad it is .
a really bad sequel . part 1 had a lot of funny moments - part 2 is just bad ( in a boring way ) and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans . shame on you , otto waalkes ! the only slightly amusing moment in the film is helge schneider who apparently seems to be pis * ed about the other characters . it 's quite easy to identify with him ... the screenplay is sloppy/non-existent . the director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately . the acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play . technically the movie is awful as well , but who can blame the cinematographer/sound guys who had to work with such an untalented director ?
it was disgusting and painful . what a waste of a cast ! i swear , the audience ( 1/2 full ) laughed twice in 90 minutes . this is not a lie . do not even rent it . zeta jones was just too mean to be believable . cusack was ok. just ok . i felt sorry for him ( the actor ) in case people remember this mess . roberts was the same as she always is . charming and sweet , but with no purpose . the `` romance '' with john was completely unbelievable .
i can not believe such slanted , jingoistic material is getting passed off to americans as art house material . early on , from such telling lines like `` we want to make sure they are playing for the right team '' and manipulative framing and lighting , a love divided shows it 's true face . the crass manner in which the irish catholics are shown as hegemonic , the protestants as peaceful and downtrodden , is as poor a representation of history as early us westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and american indians . the truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the irish catholics in the story ; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves ! it is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it 's obvious intent , so far from attempting art . this film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library .
this might be unbelievable , but this movie has grossed $ 878,138 in russia ! it 's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running ! well , i have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh `` movie '' , which had almost no screening around the world . that 's some kind of enigma ! haha ! maybe it was based on the fact that another movie , `` pledge this '' with paris hilton , which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere , had major screenings in russia and grossed more than 1mln $ . besides , both movies had a lot of promotion , like there were the banners all over the city , tv commercials and etc . speaking about movie , i 'd say it 's dull and absolutely boring . it could be better , really . even if it has jessica simpson .
i did n't feel as if i 'd been raped like i did with the enchanted christmas , but belle 's magical world is still the antithesis of beauty and the beast . like christmas , bmw hates its audience , although not to such an extreme degree . it 's ugly , uncanonical , idiotic , and the writing is horrifically bad.none of the stories work . these are not the characters we loved from batb at all , they 're a bunch of pod people . i wanted to dissect it , but after a few minutes , i gave up , because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously . what we have here are three stories . `` the perfect word '' is an overbearing , ponderous study of forgiveness . `` fifi 's folly '' only works if you can accept that babette 's name is actually fifi and that she 's a closet james bond villainess and that lumiere is an idiot concerning women . `` broken wing '' ( or `` broken wind '' as i like to call it ) is probably the most heinous of the bunch . beast hates birds ? since when ? do n't watch this crap- every copy of this video deserves to be cremated . beauty and the beast is still a cinematic classic , a transcendent celebration of love , art , intelligence and the human soul .
i grew up ( b . 1965 ) watching and loving the thunderbirds . all my mates at school watched . we played `` thunderbirds '' before school , during lunch and after school . we all wanted to be virgil or scott . no one wanted to be alan . counting down from 5 became an art form . i took my children to see the movie hoping they would get a glimpse of what i loved as a child . how bitterly disappointing . the only high point was the snappy theme tune . not that it could compare with the original score of the thunderbirds . thankfully early saturday mornings one television channel still plays reruns of the series gerry anderson and his wife created . jonatha frakes should hand in his directors chair , his version was completely hopeless . a waste of film . utter rubbish . a cgi remake may be acceptable but replacing marionettes with homo sapiens subsp . sapiens was a huge error of judgment .
this is a rip off of the old frankenstein premise . an acclaimed scientist is killed in a freakish accident and his father , a noted brain surgeon saves the brain . it is then put into a robotic body of his own design . his brother , an electrical genius , gives the 'colossus ' impetus to transfer thoughts into motion . the whole project goes bad , when the creation goes berserk . special effects are undeveloped . the script is lacking . and it is humorous that this is not scary a bit . well , very small kids will think this is good . if you are wide awake at three in the morning and this comes on .... night , night . the lead characters are played by otto kruger , john baragrey and ross martin . ed wolff played the 'colossus ' .
it 's about time we see a movie that stays unbiased towards these old indian traditions . at times it is clear how most of the 'doctors ' are charlatans , even lying about how they do n't charge their clients . while they are wearing their gold watches , the 'donation ' box is mandatory . notice that there are only a couple of people who get 'cured ' while we see quite a few cases . keep in mind while watching that ingesting mercury is not toxic and that the smallest indian bank note is 5 rupee , while the average salary in india is 1,700 ru/month .
( david h. steinberg ) 's script seemed initially having some real smart points that could 've made good romantic comedy , but but but , oh dear ! what did ever happen in the way ? ? ? ! ! ! ! i 'll tell you what happened . originally it 's ( animal house - 1978 ) and ( porky 's - 1982 ) . although that was long time ago , but those are the pioneers , the godfathers of the new genre : the crude teen comedy . then the 1990s came . after important instances that became smash hits ( repulsive ones am i add ) such as ( problem child - 1990 ) , ( dumb and dumber - 1994 ) , ( the nutty professor - 1996 ) , and ( there 's something about mary - 1998 ) which i think slackers is affected by , there was the top of the era and the prophet of the next era , the one and only : ( american pie - 1999 ) which 's undoubtedly and incomparably a genre 's icon . after that i think every comedy of that kind got to be that highly filthy , cum laude nasty , to be admired by the youth otherwise it might be out of fashion ! i believe that ( slackers ) had a smart plot first as a script , then its makers got to add some real big amount of : rudeness , filthiness , strangely shameless sex to be made - at those days - as easy as pie ! like they had to fill every scene with freely elements such as : masturbation , oral sex , urination .. etc just to look a la ' mode . they 're wholly unnecessary elements to the story but surely they are so necessary to make the profits , and to catch the latest vogue in making teen comedies . the problem is in how all of that has replaced already any possible comedy in it . some of its moments looked literally horrible , and that as you see is the point . it 's all in ( jason schwartzman ) 's looks and performance ; memorably disgusting to the utmost . so the ambition transformed from being that romantic comedy into making what was n't done before of pure skinning images . to be more like a horror where you 're asking all the time ; what nastier would happen ? ( vomiting , farting , .. etc ) ; these are the easiest combination to create a comedy nowadays . though even if you hated it you 've got to love something ( mostly for being bold ) , for me it was only gina gershon cameo 's scene . anyhow they designed it as a whole to achieve being outrages-for-outrageousness , like an adolescent 's naughty dream . though the majority of it was near to anybody 's nightmare . what made me sad is that this one at its core was a real potential work , and not another cheap , another stupid comedy as it eventually managed to be . remember well the details of stealing the exam ( the first 2 minutes ) , so the movie 's main plot ( weirdo trying to reach a girl by blackmailing cool guys ) through the pattern of ( boy loves girl , and girl loves another boy ) because save that , it 's nothing but a candidly schlock . it dealt with its material the tacky way bunch of dirty college boys , who got nothing to do but making mawkish quip out of anything , would do . it ended up as being , and i 'm sorry to say it , a smiling sh * t ! at its end it said something ( can you imagine ! ) about how it 's the time and the place too for the impostor or the slack to win , totally like this comedy itself . it sounds good ending yet for totally another better movie ; which could assure my opinion about this one as smart one .. once ! and it does n't need much to understand that this movie 's makers were the real slackers ! maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in hollywood , but even if .. the final result here was n't at least witty by any sense of the word . p.s : its scriptwriter ( david h. steinberg ) , who wrote the story of ( american pie 2 ) as well , has a main page at the imdb where you 'll find under the `` additional details '' his usual `` plot keywords '' which are : sex / vulgarity / crude humor / ... they just forgot to write urineing while showering or baring 70 year old women !
it seems that salvatores could n't decide what to do with this movie : some of it is a very weak thriller ( and i say very , very weak ) , some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters . both things have been tried in psychological thrillers , but in this case the movie can not hold things together , due to poor , superficial scripting , bad acting and a too dark , too dull cinematography . i 'd say that salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings , where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot . on the whole , a b-movie , hardly worth your money ... vote : 4/10
its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies , and i do not see where all this 'its not that bad ' rubbish is coming from . the acting is terrible , it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other 'dancing ' movies out there . its terrible ! the name should scream do n't watch . 'how she move . ' since when can movie titles ignore grammar ? at least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes , these ones do n't even deserve a watch . i give it a 1 out of 10 , just because there is no zero . i seriously implore anyone with an iq of over 60 not to watch this , and not to waste your money . the 1.6/10 should tell it all . this movie should not have even be made .
this is absolutely the worst movie i 've seen all year . first , i will say that the acting was very good , and by all of the cast . this was apparently meant to be very offbeat , and in that regard it succeeded . by the same token , the story revolves around a self-centered wannabe , who is a clueless , talentless chronic liar , whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers . this was worse than watching a car wreck .
`` three daring daughters '' is a sickly sweet , rose-colored look at divorce , remarriage , and single-parent living . obviously , social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted , takes a cruise , and then dates and marries a band conductor . even when the `` its just a movie '' phrase excuses the script from addressing real-life problems , 'daughters ' suffers from too many incoherent high-note songs , children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader hose iturbi playing himself . is n't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married ? admittedly , this movie was released in the nineteen forties . only a love for old style hollywood romance and comedy could make 'daughters ' a tolerable film .
the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi 's fate as an assassin , fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga . that 's as poetical as i 'll get when talking about azumi 2 : death or love , because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood-driven assassin , after watching azumi 2 i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before . not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience . in azumi 1 we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics ( which is their number one priority ) as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape . but i wo n't hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi 's way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma . by the way , chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go , minus the cool weapon and sense of menace . this brings me to the final blow which is the action , simply disguised in the title as the 'death ' side of the epic . in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons . to no one 's surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily . in azumi 1 , the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi 2 was at least climaxed and worthwhile . some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter . i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched . the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution . as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation , i wo n't lie and i 'll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film , but i 'll step right up and say that after watching azumi 2 , the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece . for what it 's worth , azumi 2 : death or love could have gone straight to video , with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins , doing their best to restore the peace , with an unwavering courage to die trying .
went to watch this movie expecting a 'nothing really much ' action flick , still got very disappointed . the opening scene promised a little action with a tinge of comedy . it keeps you hooked for the first half coz till then you are expecting that now its time for the action to kick in . well , nothing of that sort happens . the movie drags and the ending just thumps you down to a point that you get annoyed.wonder what was the director thinking . made no sense watsoever . the movie lacked in all aspects , had no real storyline and it seemed very hollow , even if `` rambo '' was in it , i do n't think he could have helped the rating at all . there is simply no logic to the movie . a perfect way to waste your time and money . by far the most irritating movie i have ever seen and i am sure there will b others who 'll have the same viewpoint after enduring it . definitely not for people who have a little movie sense left in them .
i rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie . i figured that you really could n't go wrong with a concept of ex girlfriend with super powers . ... but the movie was confused and pointless ... it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in . also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love . it seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of fatal attraction super hero .. but i guess not . this is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be . you could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date . if the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and cleaned it up - the movie might have a fighting chance . a serious waste of time . b
this may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production , ever . 1 . the most exciting part is the beginning , where the guy is walking ... and walking ... and walking ( spoiler ) . there is about 15 minutes of just walking . how ? 2 . not to mention there 's a lot of issues with the lighting , and it 's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day . 3 . the acting was terrible . it looks like they found a community theater ( in mexico ) ... and then took the people who were turned away . please , for the love of everything holy , do n't rent this movie . if you know someone who owns it , apologize to them . the director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the public .
a found tape about 3 ? guys having fun torturing a woman in several inhuman ways . yeah , spoiler . first of all , the acting made this short not scary at all , the woman seemed to have orgasms , not suffering . some of the punishments were so ridiculous ! what 's shocking about throwing some meat or spin her in a chair ? if you are shooting a nonsense tape , at least make it good . the only part to remark is the end : the hammered hand and the pierced eye , the rest of the film is really poor . to end the boredom , the supposed story about the tape being investigated , extra bullshit .
this was one of the most boring movies i 've ever seen i do n't really know why just your run-of-the-mill stories about guy who is about to get married , and starts to fancy someone else instead . story has been told a thousand times . nothing new or innovative about it at all . i do n't really know what was wrong with this film . most of the time when these kinds of actors/actresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before , it 's really entertaining . there are usually little clever thing in them that are n't really in any other . for some reason , this one just does n't hold your attention . you can pick out some funny parts , or clever ideas in it , but for some reason they 're just not funny , nor clever in any way i wish i new how to explain it , but i don't just do n't waste your time on this one
i was very excited about seeing this film , anticipating a visual excursus on the relation of artistic beauty and nature , containing the kinds of wisdom the likes of `` rivers and tides . '' however , that 's not what i received . instead , i get a fairly uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature . which is clearly a quite unorthodox claim . the photographer seems conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed `` ethical '' duty he has to the workers occasionally peopling the images , along the periphery . and frankly , the images were not generally that impressive . and according to this `` artist , '' scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful . in all respects , a stupid film . for people who 'd like to feel better about their environmental consciousness ... but not for any one who would like to think about the complexities of the issues surrounding it .
this movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured . there 's male full frontal nudity , dead animal parts , dogs licking nipples , the female loosing control of her bladder . all shot in a gray cold color . effective , but a little too much . we then move on to seeing the btk killer 's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes . the tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and it 's creepy . here we do n't see fancy or good imagery , it looks as if shot with your home camera . it does n't look horrifying , but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling . what this movie does n't have is any drama , really . there are some cop scenes every once in a while , but there 's no excitement in terms of them finding the killer . there is n't much of an arc to this story . this could have been an effective psychological thriller , a study of madness . unfortunately , the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage . it 's dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again . sometimes you do n't know it 's coming and do n't have enough time to look away . and that i have to reject . i 'm all for low budget horror movies but i do n't tolerate animal suffering . it was unnecessary , excessive , and comes without warning . i 'm glad that lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does , but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore . stay away from this garbage .
i honestly believe that anyone considering film-making be subjected to this mind-boggling failure . like the `` films '' of edward wood , jr. in the '60s and '70s , this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts , re-editing their films , and reworking their special effects until they finally look right . this movie is also a decent argument for the studios ' pre-screening process . if mr. hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience , perhaps he would have cut 75 % or the walking/running/strolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes . film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is `` good enough '' can truly be . every performance , every line of dialog , every digital effect , every filter effect , indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity . a beginning filmmaker may find himself/herself tempted from time to time to think `` at least i accomplished something '' or `` just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself '' . this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out . critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment `` the worst movie ever made '' . beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are , and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites . also , beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay , and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story . writers and directors who watch bad made-for-cable movies of the week and think `` i can do better than that '' can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre results . i sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers . particularly those entering the craft in this current post-lucas and post-spielberg environment . there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects . the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off . some ca n't even come close to it .
it should come as no shock to you when i say that alone in the dark is a crappy movie . to put it bluntly , it 's as if a dung monster defecated , ate the result , and then vomited . the final product would still outshine this movie . seemingly based on an ancient ( ! ) atari video game , the movie has something or other to do with a portal to the bowels of the earth , the unleashing of demons , and ancient civilizations . something about there being two worlds , that of darkness and that of light . ( guess which one 's ours . ) oh , and 10,000 years ago a really super-duper advanced civilization opened the portal , demons came over and had a blast , then wiped out the civilization . which is why we 've never heard of them , conveniently enough . christian slater , perhaps pining for the days of heathers and pump up the volume , plays edward carnby , a paranormal researcher to whom something bad happened when he was 10 years old . he 's hot on the trail of one of the artifacts of said advanced civilization . carnby used to be part of a secret institution called 713 , which has been trying to figure out what happened to that long-ago civilization . but carnby believed he was n't going to be able to find the answers he sought , so he left the group . but see , these beasties are out , and they get their prey in varying ways , such as gutting them , splitting them down the middle , implanting neurological control devices in them , or just turning them into killing zombies . yes , it 's another zombie movie . that 's about as distilled i can make the plot . it 's pretty convoluted and incomprehensible . in similar movies , one might see the intrepid researcher/adventurer figure things out a step at a time , and when we the audience are mentally with the researcher , it 's a lot of fun . but when the scenes shift from attack to attack with no perspective or context ... not so much fun . the acting is dreadful , save for slater , who ( although he almost seems embarrassed to be in the movie ) showed he was capable of carrying the acting load . he had to ; get this - tara reid is cast as a museum curator ! honest to goodness , i thought i 'd seen the casting of a lifetime when denise richards was cast as a nuclear physicist in tomorrow never dies . but reid here matches richards , crappy emoting for crappy emoting . hightlights include reid pronouncing `` newfoundland '' as `` new fownd land , '' reid delivering most of her lines in a dazed , throaty monotone ( kinda like she 'd been on an all-night bender for the past week before filming ) , reid - a museum curator , mind you - spending a lot of the movie in a midriff-bearing top and hip-hugger jeans . oh yeah , she was as believable as jessica simpson giving stock quotes . oh , why must the pretty ones be so dumb ? ( note : i do n't think tara reid 's all that good looking . she looks like she 's in perpetual need of food . ) almost everyone else in the cast is completely forgettable , except perhaps for steven dorff , who played burke , one of the leaders of 713 . dorff 's character was n't terribly well developed , but nothing in the movie was , from the sets to the characters to tara reid . but i digress . anyway , the perplexing and utterly preposterous storyline is tough enough to follow with the film moving at such a breakneck pace , but director uwe boll tosses in a pounding , mind-deadening soundtrack ; it 's so loud you ca n't hear what the actors are saying in some of the scenes ! that ca n't be right . given the acting level , however , perhaps thanks are in order to mr. boll . oh , and a fun note . the opening moments of the movie include narration ... of the words that are crawling across the screen at the same time . remember the first star wars ? you heard that now-familiar star wars theme while the prologue crawled . there was surely no need for narration ; why do i need some doofus to read what 's on the screen for me ? were the producers simply looking out for blind people ? maybe that also explains why the soundtrack was so loud - they were also looking out for hard-of-hearing people . also , the narrator inexplicably had a lisp for the first few lines of the crawl - then lost it . bizarre . alone in the dark is a loud , dopey mishmash of dreadful acting , an incoherent script , and ham-handed directing . hardly a note rings true . there 's so much chaos that the audience simply gives up caring about the characters and roots for their demise . even in the dark , the demonic creatures seem cooler and much more developed by comparison . ironically , since there were only three other people in the theater , i watched this alone in the dark . i wonder if uwe boll planned it that way ? i ca n't quite give this the lowest rating , because i had low hopes for it to begin with - and because it never grabbed me enough for me to get worked up about it . it 's atrocious , although slater redeems himself a tiny bit .
if i could give it a zero , i 'd change my mind and give it a -10 instead . absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot , does n't make sense of what is happening . just plain boring . please do n't waste your money on this one . pleaseee ! ! ! this movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killer 's story , but nopes , i did n't feel anything but disgust while watching it . do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead , its better to watch a movie you 've already seen like 3-4 times than watch this crap ! i do n't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well . zodiac killer should be called 'boriac killer ' instead ! ! !
i 'll keep the review of this program as short as possible . skip it . low budget , not funny , lousy script . acting not quite as bad as the writing , but still bad . that 's all you need to know , but i will continue for the sake of writing more than necessary . this is a film with three segments , each one parodying some other type of movie . a much funnier film with this same exact idea is `` movie movie , '' with george c. scott . very obscure , but worth searching out . mm parodied films of the 1930 's , and did it with elegance , precision and dry wit . this movie did not . it parodies three types of films , supposedly from the late 70 's , early 80 's era , only it is parodying films i 've ( almost ) never heard of . the first is , i guess , a parody of `` kramer vs. kramer , '' in a way . peter reigert does his best with a dirt poor script . the second is a parody , of , i do n't know what ... a danielle steele novel ? i mean , you might see a story like this on lifetime tv , but in a movie theater ? i mean , i remember the 70 's , i was there . this is a soap-opera type parody about a fetching young woman who sleeps her way to power . these type of things usually parody themselves , so i do n't see how this was even necessary . we are on somewhat easier ground with the third segment , `` the municipalians , '' which parodies cop movies . i noted elements of `` the new centurians '' and some `` dirty harry '' , both of which were almost 10 years old when the film was created . yeah , nice and current . robby benson plays the idealistic young rookie ( over-the-top wimpy ) while richard widmark plays the grizzled veteran cop who drinks whiskey while sitting in the police car ( oh ! stop ! my sides ! he 's actually drinking booze in the police car ! how irreverent ! ) note that this was the first film after `` animal house '' to have the `` national lampoon '' name attached . wow . to go in five years from that classic flick to this pile of dung is nothing short of shocking . i could go on for hours about the sad decline that caused one of the most cutting-edge and original voices in american humor ( that would be national lampoon , the original magazine for about its first 10 years or so ) to sell out and begin a long , slow slide into a world of crap , where now the magazine is long gone and it only exists as a brand name to slap on low-budget `` comedy '' films for a fee . yet another reason why capitalism ( and cocaine ) sucks so bad . anyway , this movie is a serious time suck . do n't waste your 90 minutes . i want mine back . on the positive side , fred willard 's in it !
an incoherent mess with a gratingly deafening sound track , `` soul survivors '' is the latest entry in the `` who 's dead and who 's alive '' genre of horror films . two teenaged couples , sean and cassie and matt and annabel , prepare to go off to different colleges , but before they part until thanksgiving break , they attend one last fling at a rave-type party in some burnt-out church at the suggestion of lusciously slutty annabel ( eliza dushku , a.k.a . faith , the other vampire slayer ) . motiveless creepy guys start paying far too much attention to cassie ( the generic melissa sagemiller ) for reasons that are never explained , and before long , the quartet leave the party . driving away in their suv , they are pursued and then passed by the motiveless creepy guys , who promptly and inexplicably do an intentional 180 in the middle of the highway , causing a nasty and fatal accident as the suv flips over an embankment and plunges into a river . sean is killed ( or is he ? ) , and cassie spends the rest of the movie coping with loneliness and guilt ( she was driving ) when she 's not being haunted by sean 's ghost or chased by those motiveless creepy guys . much unexplained incoherence follows as cassie 's mental state degenerates further , until we reach the predictable conclusion . so , who is dead and who is alive ? after ninety minutes of this purgatory , who actually cares ?
* review may contain spoilers * predictable , campy , bad special effects . it has a tv-movie feeling to it . the idea of the un as being taken over by satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible . the premise is interesting , but its excution falls waaaay short . if you want to convert people to christianity with a film like this , at least make it a quality one ! i was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck . ca n't say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago , and there is n't really much to say about this film other than ..... skip it !
after the opening credits , there 's a black screen for about a minute . a minute of nothing , then a girl wakes up and takes a shower.then her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert , after much padding , they hit something and skid off the road . they awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her offspring.the killings are sadly very tame for a supposed video nasty . the twist ending silly and predictable . no one involved in the mess would ever make anything of note again . so there are still happy endings sometimes . eye candy : sara ansley gets topless , and laurel munson has full frontal on display my grade : d
i had no background knowledge of this movie before i bought it , but it sounded cool and i 've been wanting to see a really kick-butt viking movie for awhile now ... alas , this film was not what i was looking for . i had hoped for the best , but instead , was delivered a boring nordic soap-opera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time . the film 's premise is intriguing enough : it 's about a viking warlord who defies his god and odin is so enraged that he curses the warlord 's son , named barek , to death and rebirth as a berserker . this barek guy is then forced to live enraged , insane , and violent lifetime after lifetime . the movie is filmed competently enough , with some rich cinematography and quasi-good performances by the actors , but again , i found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end . the filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semi-unique but they dropped the ball . perhaps it could 've been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore ... i mean , we are talking about `` berserkers '' here , are n't we ? vikings were supposed to be bad enough , what with all the raping and pillaging , so are n't berserkers supposed to be even more extreme ? all in all , unless you 're a fan of the young and restless ( etc ... ) or , are yourself , in fact , an insane berserker who likes self torture , i 'd probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid .
this movie was supposed to have depicted a 'ladie 's man ' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all . however , i did not care for his mission to settle down , because i did n't care for his character . i do n't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him . he had absolutely no class , or charisma . he should 've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing , but to no avail . just because he is a musician does not make him sexy . not to mention , the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous . does this man have any shame what-so-ever ? had he tidied up , and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character , but alas , his character was bland and boring . gina gershon 's character was unnecessarily british . she could 've just as easily been an uptight out-of-towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor british accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie . the only two characters i cared for were the fish and frog . now those two had chemistry ! academy nominations for both stat ! plot holes , lack of character development , horrible acting , unnecessary drama , cliché moments ... what a mess of a movie .
meet peter houseman , rock star genetic professor at virgina university . when he 's not ballin ' on the court he 's blowing minds and dropping panties in his classroom lectures . dr. houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal . i 'd want to be immortal too if i looked like christian bale and got the sweet female lovin that only vu can offer . an assortment of old and ugly university professors do n't care for the popular houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results . this causes peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum . much to my amazement there are side effects and he , get this , metamorphoses ! into something that is embedded into our genetic dna that has been repressed for `` millions of years '' . he also beds dr. mike 's crush sally after a whole day of knowing her . she has a son . his name is tommy . he is an angry little boy . metamorphosis is n't a terrible movie , just not a well produced one . the whole time i watched this i could n't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989 . the look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest . it does not help that it 's packaged along with 1970 's movies as metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment 's 50 chilling classics . there is basically no film quality difference whatsoever . the final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually , for me at least , save the movie from a lower rating . pay attention to the computer terminology such as `` cromosonic anomaly '' . no wonder peter 's experiment failed . your computer ca n't spell ! this is worthy of a view followed by a trip to your local tavern .
it 's like this ... you put in the dvd and the most professional-looking thing you see over the next ninety minutes is the logo of the distribution company . and at this point , you know you 've just been jerked around . people are generally trusting enough to assume that if something has been put on dvd , it 's going to be of a certain level -- at least financially if not creatively . but sadly this is n't the case . distribution companies are perfectly happy to throw together dvds of amateur movies and ship them right out into the stores to await the unsuspecting buyer who is drawn in by the well-designed dvd cover . the weight behind this particular project is most likely independent horror movie pioneer kevin j lindenmuth , whose name may be known amongst genre fans since he 's responsible for various other low-budget werewolf movies -- `` rage of the werewolf '' , `` werewolf tales '' and so on . `` blood of the werewolf '' is made up of three short independent werewolf stories with no real connection other than the fact that they deal with hereditary shapeshifters . the first segment , `` blood reunion '' , pretty much sets the tone for the whole thing ... a man returns to his home town to look up a girl who had a crush on , only to find that her domineering grandmother refuses to let her have relationships with men , and for reasons which are somehow related to a dark family secret . this instalment is poorly directed , poorly directed , and basically nothing superior to what you could throw together yourself with a few friends and a home video camera . the second story , `` old blood '' , is probably the strongest out of the three and is directed by lindenmuth himself . it tells the story of a lesbian couple , one of whom is a shapeshifter and the other wishes to be given this power . her wish is granted , but she does n't become the creature that she envisioned . this short movie shows that lindemuth has more talent and experience than the other filmmakers who worked on this project , but still not enough to raise it above the level of an amateur movie . and finally we have `` manbeast '' , in which some army guy runs through the woods while being chased by two other fellas . they wish to kill him as he has been bitten by the beast and is believed to be dangerous , but all might not be as it seems . this one has an interesting concept , but it 's stretched out to be far too long , and if you do n't guess what the `` twist '' is in the first ten minutes then you probably ai n't too bright . this pretty much sums up the problem with this whole dvd ... a few good ideas just are n't enough to justify spending money on something like this . after all , would you pay for a picture you could have painted yourself ?
the case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price . i expected a `` based on the true story '' movie only to find a shot on home video hodge-podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non-related slaughter house scenes . the video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects . i started this review before i was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but , low and behold it only got worse . if i could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten . learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one .
my guess is that this director/writer had something to say . let 's see , what it could have been ... a. frog storms would be creepy ? b. can i get someone like tom cruise to say the `` c '' word many times and look like a bad patrick rafter ? c. cast my wife and get her to say the `` f '' word every 2 seconds . this aside i really liked the beginning and the frog storm . the rest was a relentless , over-long ( under-edited ) , over-indulgent failure . glad so many of you enjoyed it !
i just happened to stumble on this film channel surfing . my first reaction was , 'oh god not again ! ' . it 's so hip to play a retard these days it has become pretentious and frankly despicable . for some reason , though , i stayed and watched it 'til the end . maybe it was my faith in the actors , hoping they 'd give me something to cheer about . and surely , ken and helena can act . also , the movie progresses into something better towards the end and actually does make a point . helena bonham carter also surprised me with her character . jane has a mean side that she uses to keep distance and repel pity . then again she has a soft side that 's just looking for love . the only thing that surprised me even more was branagh 's character ... this was a triumph of acting , the movie itself is nothing unique . see if you are an acting student ... if you 're looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one . it 's sean penn serious ! oh my , that was a bit harsh it does feature a couple jokes ... not for escapists though .
six gis , about to be send home and discharged , get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in asia . surrounded by hooded figures , two male dancers pretend to have a fight . behind them , on an altar , a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake , finally biting one of the dancers on the neck . the imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights . ( this is definitely a female imitation snake . ) the cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and , most definitely , no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed . naturally , the gis take a flash photo , send the cult members into an angry hysteria , steal the basket containing the `` snake '' and run off with it into the asian night . one of the guys , the most offensive and snarky , dies from a cobra bite on the neck , though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room . back in new york , it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives , still maintaining their bond with one another . their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley ( david janssen ) to graduate research student ( richard long ) . james dobson , jack kelly , and marshall thompson are also part of the neighborhood . richard long has a nice blond girl friend . kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer . but they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy . then a dark , shifty-looking , mysterious woman ( faith domergue ) shows up and marshall thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group . guess what happens . first janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash . then kelly gets a visit from domergue . something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk . long and dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows -- that domergue has had something to do with the deaths . they also reckon that maybe she 's turning into a cobra , which is the case . dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point . by this time long and thompson are thoroughly frazzled , particularly thompson , who is in love with domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him , too , although he must explain to her what `` love '' is . no matter . a final reckless attack by the cobra woman against long 's girl friend -- not one of the six original offenders -- and thompson must throw the snake out the window . on the pavement below , the body changes to that of domergue . the end . i think i 'll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises . i 'll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing . who paid for domergue 's fare from somewhere in asia to new york ? who 's paying her utility bills in the hotel ? who paid for her spectacular wardrobe ? how come she speaks american english so well ? what the hell 's going on ? the writers and director have clearly seen some of val lewton 's modest horror films and , though not much effort has gone into this production , they 've unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from lewton . in lewton 's `` the cat people '' , for instance , the woman is transformed into a black leopard but , with one tiny exception , the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it . most of the transformations here use shadows too , but unlike lewton 's , the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous . lewton also made occasional use of what he called `` buses '' . lewton 's first `` bus '' was a literal one . a potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of central park with only the sound of footsteps . something or someone is following her . she freezes with fright under a street lamp . something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her . she looks upward . there is a loud , wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end . it 's a bus using its air brakes to stop for her . the producers used at least two `` buses '' in this film and they amount to nothing . a guy is walking distractedly across an intersection , for instance , and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him . there is no set up to the shot . it 's jammed in with a shoe horn . i do n't much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy , ugly , venomous , and phallic . as a matter of fact , no snakes are slimy , most are harmless , and many are extraordinarily beautiful . furthermore , they 're more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals . you want a reptilian symbol for masculinity ? try a six-lined racerunner . it 's a really fast lizard . when it sees something to eat , it rushes up and gobbles it down . anyway , if you want to see some fine , low-budget scary films , do n't bother with this one . find `` the cat people '' or one of lewton 's other minor masterpieces , of which this is an obvious copy .
i might not be a huge admirer of the original `` creepshow '' , but its trashy sequel makes that anthology look like perfection ! and to think i was going into this expecting to like this one more . five years after its predecessor , george romero gets back on board the ec comic style trail and on this outing pens the screenplay for steve king 's three stories . though , the direction is handed off to michael gornick . the film mostly falters in that aspect with uneven brushes by gornick . but most of the blame would have to go to romero 's dreadfully static and unbearably cringe-like script ( especially in those dialogues streaming through the first and final story ) . moralistic messages ( that came from mostly a sour bunch of characters ) simply took over the black humour . oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rotten music score accompanying the picture . loosely linking the three tales ( old chief woodenhead , the raft and the hitchhiker ) together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia ( 80s ) animation form . i rather liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a glowing light . # the first story `` old chief woodenhead '' sees two elderly proprietors ( george kennedy & dorothy lamour ) of a general store in a dying native community , dead river . get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks dying to live it up in hollywood . in front of the store is a wooden statue of an indian chief that comes to live to avenge their deaths . -listen to george kennedy waffle .. and waffle on for 10 minutes about how he 's committed to his 'great ' community . what a nice touchy feely time . well , just like kennedy 's speeches , this is one monotonously colourless and overdrawn item that never makes good of a fine premise . the overbearing script is plain inane and the performances are suitably so . these two factors really added to my headache . when the indian comes alive and turns avenger , the goons meet a very quick ( though grisly ) death in the proper fashion . the effects were commendably done , but what about that free flowing hair . how could hollywood knock that lock of hair back ? ugh ! # second story `` the raft '' follows a group of dope smoking and yahoo teens heading up to a secluded lake . after swimming to the raft in the middle of the lake , they get trapped on the platform because of an ominous looking creature lurking in the water . -now this is much better , much better . what starts of as your basic teens run afoul turns into a mysteriously creepy set-up that 's full of tight and claustrophobic tension . and it does n't even cop out on the flashes of nudity or spiteful splatter . quite morbid it is and that goes for its sense of humour too . the surprisingly ironic ending has a beautiful touch to it . the performances from the nobodies are acceptable without making a huge mark . gornick 's direction sticks to the nasty and rather gooey side . while , the alarming music score on this occasion pressed the right chords . the sludge-like creature in the lake ( like many have mentioned ) looks like an icky black tarpaulin ( yeah you 're reading that right ! ) floating on the water . # finally number three concludes with `` the hitchhiker '' . a wealthy , but sexually lacking woman is on her way back home after being with her male gigolo , but she 's is running late . thinking of some ideas to explain for her lateness if needed , she skids off the road and accidentally hit 's a hitchhiker . instead of checking or getting help , she drives off in the hope getting home before her husband . soon enough she 's being terrorised by the mangled corpse of the dead hitchhiker . -not awful , but i really did n't get into this laughably ludicrous exercise at all . compared to the first two this one was so different in tone and tried to tickle the funny bone instead . lois chiles was okay in the lead role , but that constant assuring and the little conversations she has with herself became pitifully aggravating and downright tired . the vivid make-up effects are well-displayed and dripping with vision . when she hit 's the hitchhiker that 's when it becomes hectic , cheesy and over-the-top in its execution . from there onwards we endlessly hear our supposedly dead hitchhiker repeat and repeat and repeat the line , `` thanks for the ride lady ! '' this happens every time she decides to run over him . have a little courtesy for the dead darling . in all , the second short story `` the raft '' and the unpleasantly , well-conceived effects is what lifts this extremely inferior sequel .
shame shame shame on ua/dw for what you do ! i was appalled . do not take kids to see this movie . the humor is totally inappropriate for children - plus they 'll be bored and disappointed . certainly * we all * have read theo 's wonderful children book and certainly we have expectations ... but this is pure trash . dr. seuss would be ashamed and certainly would 've never given his `` thumbs up '' at such a dastardly attempt to capitalize on a classic . what a pity . spend your money on the book . if you own a copy , then buy the book and donate it to a toys for tots program . this movie is not worth a `` free '' ticket viewing . stick with the book . the tv cartoon version works well if you want a visual portrayal - save your money ... seriously . save your money - it will be on cable by saint patty 's day . shame shame shame on what they do ! !
saw in on tv late last night . yeah , i can hear what y'all say about this one . it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo- typical tv soap series . in all fairness , the story line does have a fine twist to it , and you might nod saying , `` well , that 's not what i expected . '' but , as a film , well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element . casting , acting , camera work , cars , costume , setting , script , no , there 's nothing to congratulate . rated r ? ? oh , that scene . did we need it ? this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched . and what was the title again ?
this film is a very funny film . the violence is bad , the acting is ... well dani , stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do . the random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually-frustrated goth lads in . personally , i think this movie really does suck . the story and characters could be very good , if say the directing , the actors and other little nibby things were made better . but the film is just bad , the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has danni in it . this film is possibly the worst b-rate film ever . and , believe me that 's hard to achieve , especially when you 're competing with def by temptation and over crappy excuses for `` serious '' horror movies . i 'm not a cof fan , and so i just see this as another rubbish movie ... a really bad one . if dani made this as a comedy then , good going him . very well done . over than that though , i rate it low , for it 's crappiness . watch it when you 're in a happy , happy , joy , joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you 're high on multiple different types of drugs .
last year 's remake of 'the hills have eyes ' was one of the better attempts to update the vaguely exploitational horror flicks of the 1970s for a new audience . alexandre aja allowed for an admirable degree of character development and when the violence started it was mean and savage and all carried out in a landscape of impeccable photography and production design . i was one of the few people who actually thought that it was better than the original and looked forward to a second visit to the particularly dark and cruel world of the savage desert mutants . 'the hills have eyes 2 ' , released just a year after the original , seems a rushed and ill-conceived attempt to cash in on the franchise with little thought to quality . jonathan craven 's screenplay could have been written in a weekend , and given the speed with which this movie made it into cinemas , probably was . it falls back on every hackneyed genre cliché in the book while offering absolutely nothing new to the desert mutant mythology . i always let out a groan of disappointment when a sequel replaces civilian characters with the military . soldiers are always so lazily written and never fail to thoroughly bore with crude caricatures of strutting macho bullshit . in my mind , 'aliens ' was the only movie to successfully make such a transition , due to james cameron 's talent , not simply for directing the best action sequences around , but never forgetting that an audience has to care about the people being butchered . he was also ably assisted by some genuinely talented actors . with 'the hills have eyes 2 ' , it 's clear that video director martin weisz is no james cameron , and the cast of television bit-parters have n't the talent or even the inclination to turn their cardboard cutout characters into anything approaching living , breathing human beings . needless to say , every character is a broad and generic cliché . they act in dumb and illogical ways , making dumb and illogical decisions that lead them to predictably dumb and illogical deaths . the latter half of the movie becomes just another tedious chased-through-dark-corridors scenario . 'the descent ' ( on which sam mccurdy , coincidentally , also worked as cinematography ) proved that even this most derivative of sequences can still be carried out with genuine originality and suspense , but we see no such innovation here . 'the hills have eyes 2 ' is just a very lazy movie , devoid of any suspense , tension , or surprise , with not a single individual involved remotely interested in producing anything of quality . it 's a tame and tired excuse for a sequel and deserves to spend the rest of its life in a blockbuster 's bargain bin .
this kind of film has become old hat by now , has n't it ? the whole thing is syrupy nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loop . it sure sounds like a good idea : a great ensemble cast , some good gags , and some human drama about what could have/might have been . unfortunately , there is no central event that binds them all together , like there was in `` the big chill '' , one of those seminal movies that spawned copycat films like this one . you end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone . the superficiality this creates is not just annoying , it 's maddening . the below-average script does n't help .
former private eye-turned-security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession . his assignment : to tail a mysterious french woman newly arrived in california ... and apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers . unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre , without enough sting or wit ( or involving plot dynamics ) in the screenplay . director and co-scenarist paul magwood ( who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement ) does n't give off the impression of having high regard for the '40s films his `` chandler '' was borne from ; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled , but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent . the handling is curiously , commendably low-keyed , and warren oates is well-cast as this '70s variant on the 'private dick ' archetype , but the movie does n't have any snap . nice to see leslie caron and gloria grahame in the cast -- though neither has much to do , and caron 's hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout . vivid cinematography by alan stensvold , nice location shooting , but it fails to come to any kind of a boil . * 1/2 from * * * *
okay , let me break it down for you guys ... it 's horrible ! if roger kumble did such a fancy job on the first cruel intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this . i 'm sorry but this movie is stupid , true it may have improved if its series was ever aired but lets be realistic ... this movie a crock ! a lot of bad acting * note the shower scene * `` kissing cousins '' ? ? ? ? ? ? what kind of line is that ? `` slipery when wet '' ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? can we say duh-m ! this movie had effort , i 'll give you that , but it was too stupid ! they even tried to make it funny by giving the house servants stupid accents which actually .... was n't funny ! it was pathetic . not to mention that they made everyone in the this one look absolutely nothing like the original cast . it 's as if they made them look different on purpose or something ! i like watching it when i 'm really really really board which does n't happen occasionally . for those of you who did like it ... okay , what were you thinking ? could you possibly choose this movie over the other one which had great acting and the fabulous sarah michelle gellar ? a movie is gold if it has sarah michelle gellar in it , duh ! but this movie does n't , no offense amy adams . oh , yeah since when does sebastain have a heart ? ? ? ? ? ugh !
darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman , with odd ties to elvis presley , running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevada ... and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own . kim basinger , a still-attractive actress of considerable merit , likes to pick quirky movies to play in , but this dreadful screenplay ( by mitchell ganem and adam-michael garber ) has n't an iota of good humor . the stereotypes and low-ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy , but even on a shambling , shameful level , the picture is crude and sloppy . if you do watch , see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac , hands always in the same position and a non-plussed look on her face . hopefully both she and elvis were well paid . no stars from * * * *
it is very unfortunate when a movie such as this is made . a great deal of work and money has been put into a film that is amateur at best . the editing drags on , there are obvious mistakes that could have been corrected easily in a second take , and the soundtrack is unimaginative . so much more could have been done with this video movie . i guess they ran out of time , or videotape . hand-held shots have a distinct amateur feel to them .
the guy did a lot of title design for a bunch of movies and i guess one day he said ; i should pick a cheap scenario , try to put as much title in it as a can ( cause after all i 'm a title designer ) and try to persuade people that this is in fact a movie . one of the worst i 've even seen that 's for sure . if you fell the urge to see nice titles , go check out some posters do n't waste your time watching this . it kinda ironic do n't you think , did you saw the poster ? the only part of his project that should had title work done have almost none !
oh man , it is amazing how somebody can claim global warming to be a science , well , i guess this elitist nonsense is now replacing the science of eugenics ! al gore tries to make this issue sound complicated , even though it just needs common sense to see this whole thing is a big hoax by a man with his own moneymaking agenda ! how have scientists estimated historical temperatures of this planet ? by estimating the sun spot activity . has nobody ever questioned if this method has been accurate ? no , not even gore himself ! so how the heck would it not be accurate to forecast future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been that accurate in the past ? according to sun spot activity the temperature today is totally in line with what it should be . how come the temperature in the entire universe has risen ( relatively ) equal much as on earth ? does our suvs cause temperature on jupiter to rise ? use some common sense ! you do not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this can be nothing else than a hoax . please research it yourself . what does al gore and his elitist friends like rothschild ( banking family that arranged live earth event ) to gain from this ? well , the new world bank will be founded on carbon credits , that is tax on everything that gives co2 omissions , and it is easier to get away with these taxes if the people are lured to think it is to save the world when it is only about money , centralized control and more power to the elitist bankers . al gore has even a company that sells carbon credits ! is it not noble to pay voluntarily carbon credits to save the world , especially if it goes into his own company ? i do not want you to blindly believe me , please do your own research and use your own common sense and i am sure you will come to the right conclusion !
why is it that any film about cleopatra , the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making ? whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest roman of them all , julius ceasar , and his successor , mark anthony , never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors . despite lavish sets and costumes , this movie is as bad as any italian `` sandals and toga '' extravaganza of the 50 's . admittedly , this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen , which is why `` gladiator '' went over well , but `` gladiator '' did not have all the romance novel sex . miss varela has as little acting talent as elizabeth taylor , but timothy dalton has talent to spare . pity some of it did n't wash off on the others .
* * * possible spoilers * * * when i saw this today i had some expectation of how it would be like , not too high , but not low either . this was nothing like i expected at all though , it seems to me like the movie makers could n't make up their mind of what kind of movie to make . in the begining of the film it 's somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting , but that 'll soon change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... as i watched further i almost fell asleep a couple of times . the ending is the most ridiculous of all though , almost splatter/comedy ... i 'm not saying it does n't have some good scenes it 's just that the film never becomes `` whole '' . 4/10 movie-man
i 'm not alone in admiring the first superman movie , a film that richard donner executed masterfully . i am also not alone in scorning richard lester 's superman 2 ... which brings us to the richard donner cut of the same movie , sadly it is still an absolute abomination . superman 's world is one where suspension of disbelief is required in strong doses , but superman 2 stretches things too far . it does n't matter who directed superman 2 because the script insults the intelligence of a first grader . in a sense there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act the way they do , unlike the original superman . with or without his powers , superman 's strength ( or lack thereof ) is handled in the least believable manner . there is too much to criticize , so i will not bother . i condemn this movie ... perhaps the slapstick in the lester version is more appropriate to the moronic script this movie is based on . super-duper bad .
this is not a boring movie , the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character , miles berkowitz , both film-maker and actor here . the storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career , the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera . the first question is about how true is all that : what is written , what came by chance ? both answers , `` yes '' or `` no '' portrays m.berkowitz as a low average human beeing . if you look for a self-fiction about love like this one , i recommand you to read some independant comic books : chester brown , joe matt ... beside of this , i felt quite disappointed to hear so much against my country , france . i know american people usually say that the french are arrogant ( that might be true then ) , etc. , and for sure the french ( and the whole world ) have lots of griefs against america , but why so much hate ? do n't think i could n't like this movie only because of that anyhow .
i was lucky enough to see a chorus line when it came to my city .. i was younger then .. but it was an excellent play .. so would someone please tell me why in heavens name did they have to make a movie out of it .. and why michael douglas ? ? ? he didnt suit the role .. this movie really sucked big time ! ! ! my advise is not to rent this movie .. save your money for something better like `` cats '' ....
needless remake , and it ca n't come close to capturing the charm of the original . the extreme length causes more than a few yawn inducing parts . this version is ridiculously politically correct . the film lacks style , and mostly it lacks talent , not just with the acting , but the direction , sets , costumes etc . are all below par . it has a blatant disregard for period detail . vanessa williams is the only cast member that shows any flair , tyne daly is n't too bad . they should have left well enough alone . the singing ranges good ( vanessa williams ) to poor ( everyone else ) . watch the original 1963 version and skip this one . there is not much here to recommend .
i am quite a fan of novelist/screenwriter michael chabon . his novel `` wonder boys '' became a fantastic movie by curtis hanson . his masterful novel `` the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay '' won the pulitzer prize a few years back , and he had a hand in the script of `` spider man 2 '' , arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time . director rawson marshall thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces , such as the gut-busting `` dodgeball '' and the genius short film series `` terry tate : office linebacker '' . and with a cast including peter saarsgard , sienna miller , nick nolte and mena suvari , this seems like a no-brainer . it is . literally . jon foster stars as art bechstein , the son of a mobster ( nolte ) who recently graduated with a degree in economics . jon is in a state of arrested development : he works a minimum wage job at book barn , has a vapid relationship with his girlfriend/boss , phlox ( suvari ) , which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex , with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion . one night at a party , an ex-roommate introduces jon to jane ( miller ) , a beautiful , smart violinist . later that night they go out for pie , and she asks jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence , `` i want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul . if you do , it will make this night indelible . '' jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by , yet none of them look him in the eye . `` i imagine it must be what death feels like , '' he says . the next day jane 's wild boyfriend cleveland ( saarsgard ) kidnaps jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill , and soon jon , cleveland and jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts , doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol . this does n't sit well with phlox , who pushes jon for a more personal relationship , namely letting her meet his new friends and his father . the film then attempts to take us on jon 's journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father , phlox and his dead-end job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with cleveland and jane . there is a problem having us follow jon throughout the film : he 's completely uninteresting . he has no ambitions , passions or goals . he walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to jane the night they met . at the outset this is n't a problem . but he never gets any more interesting . he 's a completely passive character . he simply follows along the bohemian cleveland and jane , but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself . consequently , the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party , have sex and get in arguments . in other words , much ado about nothing . what we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside . sweeping cinematography , ponderous voice-over with characters staring off into the distance , lots of sex scenes both straight and gay , big arguments , more angry sex , a chase scene and a tragic death ... but it does n't seem to matter . ironically , at one point jane , confused at a number of jon 's aimless actions , asks him , `` what 's going on , jon ? what is this all about ? '' yes , jon , do tell . we in the audience are dying to know , too . the title `` the mysteries of pittsburgh '' must refer to the characters themselves , because that 's what they are . they are all facades , one-dimensional stand-ins for actual people . the film never lets us in . we never know what makes any of them tick . we see them do lots of things , but we do n't know why . and the absence of `` why '' is one of the worst things a movie can have .
this movie was just down right bad . i love war movies and can normally come away from most movies and find something that i liked , but this was not one of them . this movie lacked substance and intensity.ok i get it , the finns put up one hell of a fight and thats great , but the story is poorly told . you do n't have any real connection with any of the characters and there 's no real story line to follow . you just go from one random scene to another , nothing flows to form the story that is trying to be conveyed . if you want a war movie that will keep you riveted , and amazingly enough without battles scenes , then i would suggest `` downfall '' ( wwii german film ) . or if you prefer a great story line and a lot of action then i would suggest `` brotherhood of war '' ( korean war/korean film ) . these two movies will not let you down as winter war will .
this was a quite brutal movie . there were huge implausibilities , and a silly script , bad acting , etc . the only reason to watch this movie is that from time to time some quite impressive sets of breasts were exposed .
i watched this film last night with anticipation , but really was n't very impressed . with the exception of 'combo ' , i thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited . it came across like a 'made for tv ' drama . i felt that the film was very contrived . the whole set up of hammering in the context at the start ( yes , we get that this is 80s britain - you can stop now ) was tiresome , and gave a very one-sided view of what life was like in 80s britain - poverty , war juxtaposed with royalty , margaret thatcher , yet nothing in between ? there were actually middle-classes who existed back then - just ordinary working people , with a decent wage and a mortgage . the falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end , for 'dramatic effect ' , i presume . the sequence of events felt a tad disjointed , as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could 've changed so quickly . the relationship between 'shaun ' and 'smell ' was toe-curling . i could n't even look during the snogging scene . i find it very hard to believe that she would 've been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger , but also looked so much younger . i know there were only four years between them , but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties , yet it 's a huge difference in your teens ! in my experience , that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one , since girls mature so much quicker , and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older . sorry , but i did n't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value . the ending was somewhat abrupt and , again , contrived . if the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic , then it fell somewhat short in my eyes . it bugs me that british films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty-stricken . do n't get me wrong , i love trainspotting , and four weddings has its charms , but ca n't we brits come up with anything different ? why are our films always so hung up on the class system ? i was born in 1973 , so was n't much different in age to 'shaun ' would 've been in 1983 . i grew up in a single parent family on a fairly down-trodden council estate in a city in england . however , my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film - i do n't even remember racism being an issue ( although i 'm not saying it did n't exist ) . 'this is england ' ? not in my experience . the bottom line is that i felt this film lacked substance , and i was completely bored and unimpressed throughout .
i 'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the american revolutionary war . this ai n't it . ( and for that matter , neither was the emmerich/devlin/gibson the patriot . but i digress . ) i saw this film at a publicity screening at the old mgm studios ( now sony ) just before it came out . the audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece , written by veteran robert dillon , directed by the esteemed hugh hudson ( of chariots of fire fame ) , and starring al pacino . but it did n't take long for people to start squirming in their seats , whispering derisive comments about pacino 's horribly misconceived accent -- he was supposed to be an american frontiersman of scottish ancestry ( ! ) -- and that of nastassja kinski , who was supposed to be recently emigrated from england ( ! ! ) . then the story started and it all went downhill fast . motivations were muddled , dialogue was atrocious , events had no historical or political context . what there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence ; by the second or third time that alleged lovers pacino and kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke . donald sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a british officer/pederast . his accent was all over the map too . i guess there were n't any english actors available . lots of people left . those who stayed tried to stifle giggles , then openly guffawed . i stuck it out -- i figured that at least the battle scenes might be good . i was wrong . inexplicably , hudson chose to film them with hand-held cameras , not even steadicam , the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel 'authenticity ' which ruined the sense of scale . there was a semi-famous tv reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me : ( the late ) gary franklin of channel 7 eyewitness news . i could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us . and sure enough , on his tv segment the next day he gave the film a '10 ' on his notorious 'franklin scale of 1 to 10 ' , while remarking churlishly about the louts who 'd disrupted the screening the night before , who clearly did n't know art when they saw it . what a buffoon . after this disaster , pacino did n't star in another film for almost 4 years . hugh hudson 's career never recovered . you ca n't say i did n't warn you .
seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970 , myra breckinridge has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions . now at last on dvd in an unexpectedly handsome package , it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released . gore vidal 's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement . most filmmakers felt that the novel 's story , structure , and overall tone would not translate to film , and industry insiders were surprised when 20th century fox not only acquired the rights but also hired vidal to adapt his novel to the screen . but studio executives soon had cold feet : vidal 's adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer-director michael sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen . studio executives hoped that sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film , but sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves . rewrite upon rewrite followed . the cast , sensing disaster , became increasingly combative . in her dvd commentary , star raquel welch says that she seldom had any idea of what myra 's motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself , and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film . in the accompanying `` back story '' documentary , rex reed says that myra breckinridge was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls . the accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself . the basics of vidal 's story are there , but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications , it seems to have no point in and of itself . everything runs off in multiple directions , nothing connects , and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had . and while director sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce , the only laughs generated are accidental . chief among these accidents is mae west . it is true that west is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one-liner -- but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies , and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling , to say the least . but worse , really , is the fact that west is outside her era . her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self-caricatures ever seen on film . the remaining cast is largely wasted . raquel welch , a significantly underestimated actress , plays the title role of myra very much like a barbie doll on steroids ; non-actor rex reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of myron , but the entire role is essentially without point . only john huston and cameo players john carradine , jim backus , william hopper , and andy devine emerge relatively unscathed . yes , it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be : fast when it should be slow , slow when it should be fast , relentlessly unfunny from start to finish . it is true that director sarne does have the occasional inspired idea -- as in his use of film clips of everyone from shirley temple to judy garland to create counterpoint to the action -- but by and large , whenever sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one . the how and why of that is made clear in sarne 's audio commentary . sarne did not like the novel or , for that matter , the subject matter in general . he did not want to write the screenplay , but he needed the money ; he emphatically did not want to direct the film , but he need the money . he makes it very clear that he disliked author gore vidal and rex reed ( at one point he flatly states that reed `` is not a nice person '' ) , and to this day he considers that vidal and reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their 'homosexual agenda ' -- which , when you come right down to it , seems to have been their desire that sarne actually film vidal 's novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take-off on it . although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community , sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people . when taken in tandem with the film itself , sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic -- and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project . in addition to the sarne and welch commentaries and the making-of documentary , the dvd release includes several trailers and two versions of the film : a `` theatrical release '' version and a `` restored '' version . the only difference between the two is that the final scene in the `` restored '' version has been printed to black and white . the edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored , but the documentary details what they were . the widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine . but to end where i began , this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians , movie buffs , and cult movie fans . i give it three out of five stars for their sake alone , but everyone else should pass it by . gary f. taylor , aka gft , amazon reviewer
this movie was so predictable . its a complete rip off of those , `` i was abused by daddy i 'm gon na kill women '' movies . stupid scenes , bad acting , unoriginal storyline , really low budget piece of crap film . do n't waste your time people . trust me . my rating : 0/5.0
i ca n't believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of 6 ! it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring , certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long , long time . in a no-budget way , it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck . this film should be avoided at all costs . it 's one of those `` festival films '' that only please the pseudo-intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it `` different '' , therefore good . bad film-making is not `` different '' , it 's just bad film-making .
the first cube movie was an art movie . it set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented , and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they could n't understand . it was , on the non-literal level , a `` man vs. cruel nature '' plot , where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end , triumphing to face a new , indefinable world beyond man 's petty squabbles ; a world where there were no more struggle , but peace . i rated cube a 10 out of 10 , and it 's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels . the second movie , hypercube was a massive disappointment . some of the ideas were kind of cool , but in the context of the original movie , both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning . still , for being fairly entertaining , i rated it a 5 out of 10 . the third movie , cube zero , while ignoring the second , plays like a vastly inferior commercial b-movie rehash of the first , sans the symbolism . there is no `` homage '' or `` tribute '' here ; there is only ripping off . the same kind of plot , with some elements idiotically altered ( like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say ) . that we see something from `` behind the scenes '' means nothing , because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment , the architects of which we hear nothing of . and , in this movie , those who get through to the exit ( like kazan did at the end of the first movie ) are just killed - where the * bleep * is the sense in that ? ! that 's just flippin ' stupid . i 'm glad i did n't pay to see this . the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad , but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10 .
they constructed this one as a kind of fantasy man from snowy river meets butch cassidy and the sundance kid , and just for a romantic touch ned and joe get to play away with high class talent , the bored young wives of wealthy older men . ok , there are lots of myths about ned kelly , but there are also a lot of well documented facts , still leaving space for artistic creativity in producing a good historical dramaticisation . i mean , this is not the robin hood story , not the arthurian legends , not beowulf , not someone whose life is so shrouded in the mists of many many centuries past that any recreation of their life and times is 99 % guesswork . it 's only a couple of lifetimes ago . my own grandparents were already of school age when ned was hanged . so it 's silly me for fancifully imagining this movie was a serious attempt to tell the kelly story . having recently read peter carey 's excellent novel `` the true history of the kelly gang '' i had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein . but no , the fact is that mick jagger 's much derided 1970 kelly was probably far closer to reality , and a better movie overall , which is n't saying a whole lot for it . glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the dvd ! i 'll give it 3/10 , and that 's only because some of the nice shots of the australian bush make me feel generous .
`` i thought i 'd be locked away in a padded cell and they 'd throw away the key '' ( thus is a paraphrased snatch of dialogue from `` state of mind '' . one wonders in what tangled forest paula milne and her co-writer found the magic mushrooms they must have eaten , to create this feeble `` whodunnit '' and bring such rubbish to our screens . a padded cell should indeed be left available . niamh cusack did her best , ( as did the other actors ) but surely her talent deserves a better vehicle than this . the height of absurdity has been reached , and this particular `` state of mind '' is best buried and forgotten , and certainly not just `` placed in a box and locked away in a drawer '' .
this early john wayne lone star western has a bit more going for it than the run-of-the-mill oaters wayne had been making for lone star up until that time . for one , it has his old friend paul fix in it ; fix , being a much better actor then the standard lone star villain , brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line-readings often delivered in these oaters . the plot , about mistaken identity , payroll robbery and murder , is as trite and perfunctory as you 'd expect it to be in a 1930s low-budget western , but wayne 's strapping good looks , easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable . plump , balding eddy chandler is n't quite believable as wayne 's womanizing `` partner '' , and there 's a running gag about something that happens whenever chandler and wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome . on the other hand , wayne 's love interest is played by none other than mary kornman , the little `` mary '' of the early `` little rascals '' fame . she is a grown-up 20-year-old now , blonde and cute as a button . most of wayne 's leading ladies in these lone star/monogram `` b 's '' were fairly bland and colorless , but mary is perky , cute and , yes , sexy . there 's a scene in the general store , where she works , in which wayne asks her to get him a bottle of `` nerve tonic '' , which happens to be on the top shelf , so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf . wayne 's ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps , then again as she comes down , then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935 . wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt . anyway , it 's an interesting little `` b '' , not great , but not as choppy and random as many of his lonestar productions of the time . the final gunfight is n't handled all that well , and chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while , but all in all , it 's worth a look , if only to see a cute and sexy mary kornman .
lipstick is another glossy movie failure.i am trying to think of one good thing that i could say about the movie , and i am having trouble coming up with something.i guess the red dress that margaux hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part.the writing and the script was not the worst that i have ever encountered , but it could have been a lot better . lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view.the sets were very glossy and nice to look at.the cast was okay . i felt like anne bancroft 's character was the only feasible character in the entire movie.it was sad to see chris sarandon waste his time on this one .
i 'm not sure what . i just could n't laugh at it . i had an open mind . i did n't want to be a tight- @ ss about it . but i seriously just could n't laugh at this film . it was just not funny to me . some parts it seemed like ben stiller and jack black tried too hard . just because you put two very funny men together does n't mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy . some movies just should n't be made . this is one of them . because it does a lot of old jokes and the acting was just stupid . i know , i know it 's a comedy . sort of at least . but i was just not impressed . i 'm sorry , but i can not give this anything lower than a two . and that 's all i 'm giving . 2/10
i saw `` paris je t'aime '' because a friend really wanted to see it so i went along with him . going in , i was indifferent about the film but leaving the theater i really regretted wasting 2 hours of my life sitting through this tepid production . the `` stories '' are almost completely forgettable except for the fact that most of them were awful . what do gena rowlands and ben gazzara have to do with paris ? the endless parade of american actors most definitely gave this french film a remarkably non-french feel . the clichés about paris were endless . yes , most of them were playing with clichés about paris but by spending so much time making fun of french clichés , they directly and regrettably promoted them once more . yes , paris is the city of love . we get it . the worst segments were : the one directed by wes craven ( oscar wilde ) ; the one with nick nolte ; the mime one ( the worst ? ) ; the hair products one ; the one with juliette binoche ( willem dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of paris ? ) ; the vampire one ( when i think of paris i think of elijah wood ) . the one with natalie portman , which really looked like a mentos commercial and it was stupid ( the blind young man should know portman was just playing a part when she called him ) . on and on it went . it felt endless . i did n't like the coen bros one as well . it really plays with those parisien clichés but i did n't find it funny . just annoying . the gus van sant one was interesting but it was so slight ( and the punchline was obvious ) that it barely registered . there were only two `` successful '' segments and they were the one about the immigrant nanny who leaves her baby at a kindergarten only to babysit a baby for a rich woman . nice irony there . and the segment about the african who is stabbed . it 's the best segment in the whole film but this segment has nothing to do with paris . the story could have taken place in any city around the world . the last segment , the one with the chubby middle aged woman was sorta interesting too but the underlying tone was bad . they wanted to celebrate her limited grasp of french but the segment came off as being condescending . the whole project felt forced and uninspired . almost like the french government sponsored this film to promote tourism . all in all , with only about 10 to 15 minutes of interesting stuff , `` paris je t'aime '' was an awful cinematic experience .
... from this awful movie ! there are so many things wrong with this film , acting , writing , direction , editing , etc . that it 's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst . the music ! i noted that the film has two composers listed . this must be the reason why every single frame has music , of the absolute worst `` d '' movie style drivel . they have never heard of the expression `` less is more '' . it got so painful to listen to , i muted the sound every time there was no dialogue , not that the dialogue was that good . you have to feel sorry for robert wagner and tom bosley , i 'm sure they did n't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers . see it at your own risk .
sucks . that 's all i got to say about this sorry excuse for a film . sucks . sucks . sucks . i mean , what the hell were they thinking ? the idiots involved should never be allowed to make another films . the acting was so bad that it even failed to entertain on a bad level . the attempt at a `` lesbian scene '' was sad . i felt so bad for the ladies involved . this movie sucks ! sucks ! sucks ! i heard rumors of a sequel . god help us all
being a big fan of corman 's horror movies i expected from his western a bit more than i got . well , i was entertained all right . i had almost as many laughs as watching mel brooks ' blazing saddles . see the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west . you can kill time by counting them if there happens to be an otherwise boring scene going on . and the horses seem to have gears in them too , considered the fast-forward chases . see also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number that reminds of a certain fashionable dance from 1920 's , here decades before the style was invented . hope the saloon around them wo n't crumple . in the middle of all this mayhem the main actors do a decent job . ireland , garland and hayes are all truly fine . a special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from 'johnny guitar ' , but does n't quite impress the same way . but there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this . just like a really bad old horror movie , it might fail one way but succeeds to give joy anyway . that is one of the reasons corman 's work appeals to me and that is why i dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you get the chance .
it 's telling that as of the entry of this comment , no females have submitted a vote of any kind for this movie . not surprisingly , cheesy science fiction does n't appeal to them quite as much ... if you like a good `` b '' movie , and especially if you like to satirize them as you watch , you will like this . if you do n't have fun watching bad movies , this one 's not for you .
when watching little man , you 'll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes . and thats not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy ! your supposed to be laughing at it ! ! but will you ? probably not . the main problem with little man is its concept- its far too ridiculous to accept ( even as a cartoonish comedy ) , so when the loud , laboured and over the top jokes kick in , they make the whole thing seem ten times stupider than it already is . `` but its a comedy `` some of you might be screaming . thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot.i mean come on , think about it if you saw a baby with a grown mans face , would n't you be the least bit suspicious ? and if calvin wanted to hide the diamond so badly , why did n't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random womans hand bag ? and how can a qualified doctor not recognise that calvin is a grown man ? i mean seriously ... what ? `` its not about the plot , its about the laughs '' you might be screaming . well heres the thing see , there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more . if you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief suspending plot , stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs.what ever you do steer clear of little man .
like a relative that gives you a bad gift , soul survivors has its heart in the right place but trips up with a bad execution . stephen carpenter 's writing/directing effort borrows freely from other , better films , such as jacob 's ladder and abre los ojos ( open your eyes ) . for those who have n't seen either of these films , i wo n't give the premise away ; suffice to say it 's not nearly as well handled here than in those two superior films . melissa sagemiller stars as cassie , about to go away to college . her current boyfriend sean ( ben affleck ) and ex-boyfriend matt ( wes bentley ) , both friends , and annabel ( acerbic eliza dushku ) are in a car accident after being pursued by two killers ( ? ) in transparent masks . she survives the wreck , but while attending college has visions of the hospital ordeal and dead people reappear and disappear , leaving her in a state of total confusion : who is dead ? who 's alive ? what 's real ? soul survivors has the look of a bad been-there , done-that , gore-filled , blood-splattered , body-stacking teen exploitation flick . true , it has its share of killer-stalking-the-victim scenes ( plentiful , repetitive , and mind-numbing ) , but at least it attempts to build suspense through ideas rather than cliches , unfortunately rather unsuccessfully . it breeds confusion much more often than cohesion , as the story becomes jumbled , messy and incoherent near key points of the mystery ( predictable as it is . ) horror fans who pick up a copy will have no idea they are in for a film that is more concerned with building an uneasy facade of reality than delivering a body count . credit goes to carpenter for attempting to create something beyond a derivative teen horror flick ; too bad he 's created a derivative psychological thriller . sagemiller also deserves kudos for showing strength in the central performance , actually developing her character and evoking some sense of emotion as the unraveling cassie . it 's great the filmmakers try something different , but the film ends up a mixed bag and failed experiment . 4 out of 10
people who actually liked problem child ( 1990 ) need to have their heads examined . who would take the idea of watching a malevolent little boy wreak havoc on others and deem it funny ? the movie is not funny , ever , in any way , beginning to end . it wants to be a cartoon , but the writers do n't realize that slapstick is n't funny when people get attacked by bears , or hit with baseball bats . it may be funny in cartoons , but not in a motion picture . the film 's young hero is junior ( michael oliver ) who , since he was a baby , has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for adoption . the families reject him , because junior tends to give them a hard time . he is then thrown into an orphanage , where he terrorizes the nuns , and writes pen pal letters to the convicted bow-tie killer ( michael richards ) . he is soon adopted by ben and flo healy ( the late john ritter and his wife , amy yasbeck ) , who are dying to have a child , in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhood . junior becomes a member of the healy household , and `` little '' ben takes an interest in him , despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the site , or throws a cat at his father `` big '' ben ( jack warden ) , a bigoted politician . i think that we 're supposed to care for junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people . his new mother , flo , is a bitch , his grandfather is completely selfish , and one little girl -- who despises adopted kids -- is such a spoiled brat . but what junior does to get the last laughs is n't funny- -it 's mean , cruel , and sometimes life-threatening . and what is the film 's message ? that kids should resolve problems with violence and vandalism ? that they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers ? they definitely do n't what it 's like to be a bad kid . junior is n't a one -- he 's just a sadistic , little twerp . there used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others . now , everybody 's laughing when junior beats up kids with a baseball bat . it 's a shame that this movie has been marketed as a `` family comedy . '' what 's worse is that problem child is rated pg . what was the mpaa thinking when they saw this ? there 's a lot of profanity and mean-spirited pranks here , that one may wonder about the dividing between the pg and the pg-13 . kids will enjoy this , but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen . and to most people , problem child will be considered a `` guilty pleasure '' classic ; a film that someone will shamefacedly admit to liking , even though the prevailing opinion , as put forth by more serious viewers , is that the movie is a piece of crap .
ok , so i am an original wicker man fan and i usually do n't like british films remade by americans , so why oh why did i put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever ? i am not a nicolas cage fan and i had some kind of moment of madness perhaps ? the film was appalling ! the bit at the beginning with the crash/fire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where edward was going , so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland , well it would n't have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated . the history behind the wicker man was n't really explored - and i guess being set in america did n't really help the whole pagan theme . this film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense . i must say that the best bit was right at the end , when nicolas cage goes up in flames ! i am in such desperate need to see the original again now , in order to cleanse my disappointed soul . i really ca n't stress how disappointing this film is , please do n't see it if you : a ) do n't like american re-makes of british films b ) are a fan of the original c ) hate nicolas cage
rather than move linearly from beginning to end , this story line of a gay couple impacted by aids `` orbits '' in time around their `` perfect day . '' the film is organized as a life remembered in asynchronous fragments rather than in a sequential flow as one directly experienced . the narration has its lyrical moments , particularly in describing the impact of loss anticipated or experienced . the dialog unfortunately lacks such grace . the script frequently compels the actors to say startlingly stupid or insensitive things that seem utterly out of character at the moment . on their second accidental encounter , clearly smitten with each other , sensitive phillip encourages a reluctant guy to tell him about his difficult week . but the moment guy begins to open up , phillip , an english major , blurts out `` you 're not a crisis fairy , are you ? '' later , watching his lover 's naked , chiseled body stride across the bedroom toward him , our young shakespeare in love begins to render the beauty of the moment in words , `` the way you cut through space .... i ca n't even describe it '' -- but lacks the verbal skills to complete his thought . this kind of drivel continues through the aids hospice scenes , bejeweled with lines like , `` what made me think death would be all neat and tied up with ribbons ? '' and `` you make florence nightingale look like nurse ratchet . '' the film often suffers from a bruising lack of subtlety . unlikable characters are far more jarring and steamroller-flattened than they need to be . phillip 's thoroughly annoying friends -- an arrogant trust fund brat and a whining , needy dweeb -- maintain a running caustic diatribe about every one crossing their path . such patter could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for clever social commentary , but sadly , their remarks are merely unpleasant , ungraced by wit or insight . it 's hard to know if our scriptwriter intentionally crafted intellectually limited characters or if he was simply running his tether 's perimeter . the plot may be what most appeals to and resonates with those who praise this film . it does seriously explore 1980 's us middle class gay life : first encounters , courting , coupling , nesting , the complexity of open relationships , friction and fracturing , dissolution , physical abuse , rapprochement , forgiveness , terminal illness , death and survival . leads phelan and spirtas give fair to good performances rendering complex characters over time . their fetching good looks help explain both the chemistry that held these two together through insensitivity and selfishness as well as the chemistry that helped some some viewers overlook this film 's painful weaknesses . the decision to chop the plot arc into tidbits and present them in out-of-sequence flashbacks added complexity without any evident dramatic utility , and in several cases left the sequence and thus the implications of a given event unclear . could i recommend the film ? to sticklers for literary and technical quality , absolutely not ! for easy going viewers in serious need of an aids survivor catharsis or in the mood for a guilty-pleasure tearjerker with a little eye candy thrown in , maybe . but better written alternatives exploring the impact of aids on relationships of that era include : philadelphia , and the band played on , longtime companion , angels in america , an early frost , parting glances , love ! valour ! compassion ! and even jeffrey .
this show is painful to watch ... it is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show , from the ever changing `` jobs '' , boyfriends , and cast . it appears that they wanted to cast amanda bynes in something ... but had no idea what , and came up with this crappy show . they cast her as a teen , surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings , and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy . soon , they realize that she needs a `` clique '' and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers . how this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me . somehow , abc has now decided that it is a `` family '' show , and thrown it into it 's afternoon lineup on abc family .
caught this movie on the tube on a sunday . i thought it was so bad i looked it up on imdb to see what others thought of it . i was not surprised at the amount of silly people who enjoyed this fluff . i was however surprised when i looked into the comments to read the hated it categories only to find that their were none . i was shocked at this ; i always look at the hated it 's as their are always those who hate a movie no matter how good it is . somehow this movie made it through unscathed by the haters i say nay to that and proclaim proudly that i hate this movie ! i know i should go into detail about why i hate this movie but to do so would only grant this movie more respect than it deserves .
it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays . it 's like all you need is a camera , a group of people to be your cast and crew , a script , and a little money and walla you have a movie . problem is that talent is n't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds . the video store shelves are filled with these so called films . these are n't even guilty pleasures , they 're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten . troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema , but most of their films are b movie gold . however , some of the films they 've put out they had nothing to do with making and some , like 'nightmare weekend , ' did n't deserve any form of release at all . pros : the cast members do the best they can with the lousy material . some unintentional hilarity . moves at a good pace ( should at 81 minutes ) . cons : awful writing , which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes . poorly lit , especially the night scenes and the ending , which you ca n't make out at all . does n't make a lick of sense . badly scored . cheap and very dated effects . total lack of character development and you wo n't care about anybody . this is supposed to be a horror film , but it 's lacking in that area and is n't the least bit scary . nothing interesting or exciting happens . loaded with unnecessary padding . final thoughts : i never expected this to be some forgotten gem , but i never imagined it would be this bad . i do n't know if it 's the worst film ever made , but it 's a definite contender . troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release . do n't make the same mistake i did and let your curiosity get the best of you . my rating : 1/5
i really felt cheated after seeing this picture . it felt like i sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing . i do n't understand what they were thinking when they made this . it hardly gets into jeffrey dahmer murdering and it has no ending . it felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel . it was like watching a television episode of the sopranos . it ends suddenly , and you know there 's going to be another episode next week . it also felt like i just watched part 1 to a two part movie . there are many possibilities for what went wrong here ; they got lazy , they ran out of money , they did n't know the rest of the story , they wanted to make a dahmer 2 . after seeing this movie they all sound very accurate . i was watching jeffrey dahmer walking through the woods . all of a sudden i hear this music playing , then writing comes on the screen and says how dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34 . wow , he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail . how about showing how he got there . how about showing dahmer 's trial . how about showing some more detail . i ca n't even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place . i actually found myself saying in disbelief , `` that 's it , that 's the end ? '' i want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good dahmer movie yet to be made . to the filmmakers i 'd like to say , if you 're going to do it , do it right .
any movie with `` national lampoon '' in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in london , england , paris , france , rome , italy , and anywhere in germany.it may be an institution in the u.s. but it is practically unknown in europe to the larger audience . `` national lampoon 's european vacation '' is unlikely to rectify that situation . the appalling griswalds are just that - appalling.they are not funny . clearly mr chevy chase thinks he 's funny , after all miss b.di angelo laughs a lot at his jokes , but she 's getting paid for it and did n't have to fork out £2.50 for the privilege . the section set in england is typical.the same old same old tv performers , messrs idle , smith , coltrane , miss m.lippman trot out the same old same old tired clichés , mr chase gets lost in the hotel corridor .... yawn , yawn , yawn .. bucking - ham palace , big ben ...... i feel cheated that we never saw bobbies on bicycles two-by-two ......... rosie red cheeks on the little chil - dren , need i go on ? the english are buffoons , the french vicious - tongued yank-haters.the germans pompous and puffed up , ( do n't mention the war , clark ) , and the italians lecherous bottom-pinchers.have i forgotten anything ? every possible `` comic '' situation is worked to death , mr chase gurns desperately , miss di angelo dimples sweetly , the children are embarrassingly bad . the fact that this franchise ran as long as it did must bring comfort to those who propound that you never lose money by underestimating public taste .
i 'm glad that i saw this film after mr.sandler became famous . it is bad .... bad , bad , bad . there is no plot . it 's like watching a painfully dull home movie . i really enjoy his other films ...... but if you 're a fan like me .... stay away from this one . it may change your thoughts on adam . you may never recover from the horror that is this film .... i 've had a better time watching old folks play scrabble in a home .......
want to watch a scary horror film ? then steer clear of this one . there 's not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable . however , there is enough scotch . single-malt , if you can manage it . if the previous comments were n't enough to keep you from watching this film sober , allow me to assist . nasa sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit saturn . a really big solar flare causes colonel steve west to bleed from the nose . things go downhill from there , and wackiness ensues . i actually read the book adaptation , which was published and released only in the uk . miles better than the film , and the book was dreadful . at least some pretense is made towards suspense , and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author 's ( rhymes with 'gas ' ) . not to say that the film is completely without merit . rick baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film , and jonathan demme found that he 's really better suited to direct . yes , there is an mst3k episode featuring this flick , but it is , of course , edited quite a bit . without the obligatory flashing of the breasts , not even the healing power of scotch can save you . please , just go watch raiders of the lost ark if you want to see a guy melt . see space cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts . i can not , in all good conscience , recommend this film to the sober film-going public .
if you enjoy seeing what must have started as a 2 hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability , you 'll love this film . otherwise , you 'll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as inspector gadget . in the previews for the film , many scenes were shown which were not in the film , and within the film , some scenes just do n't make sense . while the movie is slightly less than 1 hour and a half , i can only think of one truly memorable moment , and that is just before or during the credits !
at the end of this episode holmes asks watson not to record the case for posterity.for a good reason ! the super sleuth left his little grey cells ( sorry agatha ) at home for this tale . there is no deductive reasoning , no acute analysis of signs at crime scenes . holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot . the dastardly cam is finally dealt to by an old frail-in a manner that would have made charles bronson 's heart swell with pride-six bullets in the breadbasket.in an ensuing chase a pursuer gets hold of one of watson 's shoes.mercifully the writer did n't decide to tack on the story of cinderella to lengthen the film.the murderess , holmes and watson , escape scot free . oh well , it is a bit of a change of pace in late victorian london.a bit of sixgun law : - )
picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says `` lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public ( also black ) in the street and ask him if he is black , then walk away '' . the other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode . more laughter . now if you think the premise is funny , and the show contains many such types of situation , you will enjoy this show . for the rest , use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry . those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny . another example of the humor in the show , a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier . marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers ? i could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers , divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all .
this movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever . the acting was pathetic . jordan hinson could not show any upset emotions . at the beginning of the movie , she was supposed to be discouraged . instead , she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out . she sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene . i was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses , they had to pluck out her . everyone else was suffering from over-acting as well . it was flat out annoying . it was also an insult to figure skaters . jordan took a month to train , and they cast her as a person who makes the olympic team . it 's practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work . a pitiful excuse for a movie , and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating . do n't waste your life . it does n't even deserve one star .
* * * * minor spoilers * * * as a bad movie connoisseur i must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet `` hobgoblins '' stands apart from all others in it 's own unique way . classic baddies such as `` the creeping terror , '' `` the mighty gorga '' and `` manos '' are uniformly bad from start to finish . `` hobgoblins '' on the other hand , starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes . during my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene i thought to myself that this was a truly bad film . i was blissfully unaware that i had just seen the best that this movie had to offer . the movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept `` club scum '' sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another . with just this one film , director rick sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of coleman francis and bill rebane as one of the worst directors of all time . how bad can a bad movie be ? watch `` hobgoblins '' and wonder no longer .
`` giant '' is one of the most boring , overly-long hollywood contraptions ever . many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy . rock hudson , elizabeth taylor , and james dean are wasted in this big hollywood production . a central notion to this movie , that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land , is absurd , and i know this because i 'm from houston . a couple of scenes , especially dean serving taylor coffee , redeem this otherwise boring film . for a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how modernism changed the ranches in texas , see `` hud '' ( one of paul newman 's great performances ) or `` the last picture show . ''
i never wanted to see this film , then one day , for a joke i watched it to see how bad it was ; my preconceptions were confirmed . for starters i 'd like to question the politics of the film . it hides behind of mask of women 'making it big in the city ' but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills . these women are nothing more the whores . are slightly less attractive girls not allowed to be successful ? this is not the only right wing message of the film , there are hundreds of shots of american flags and huge wads of cash . a fine example of how the only powerful thing in america is capitalism and anything of spiritual , moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film . money is depicted as the only important thing to young people . the manageress of the bar states that she does not allow drug users in her bar , and then she goes on to poor gallons of hard liquor down her own neck and then the necks of her staff and customers . any one who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs . and finally , why are scenes in which the lead character is a point of sexual interest to the audience ( when she is getting undressed or with her boyfriend ) is her father always involved ? we watch get her undressed with the camera virtually caressing her legs while she is one the phone to her father . she 'auctions ' her father just as she 'auctions ' her boyfriend . i find this most strange . in conclusion , this film is immoral , fascistic , degrading to women and frankly , disturbing . but what else do you expect from jerry bruckhiemer ?
trust me , this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge denzel washington fan . the frustrating part is that it 's 1/3 of a great film . the first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between creasy and the girl he 's paid to protect . the trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped . so , i 'm giving nothing away when i say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she 's kidnapped . whatever the director was trying to accomplish , all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous . rapid , frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as creasy tracks down the perpetrators . these cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story . i 'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in creasy 's character and signified that a different movie was to follow . well , he was right . the movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap . the result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie .
some 25 year olds behave like teenagers , coping with the death of a high-school mate , trying to find their purpose in live and love . the script is so lame that i had to force myself to even finish this movie . stay away from it . 1/10
this is an awful film . yea the girls are pretty but its not very good . the plot having a cowboy get involved with an indian maiden would be interesting if the sex did n't get in the way . well , okay it might be interesting , but its not , because its so badly paced and and only partly acted . i can only imagine what the close ups of the dancing tushes looked like on a big screen , probably more laughable then they do on tv . ( i wo n't even mention the topless knife fight between two women who are tied together and spend the whole thing chest to chest . never read about that in the old west ) this is a film that requires liberal use of fast forward . i like schlock films but this is ridiculous . there is a reason that i do n't go for this sort of films and that they tend not be very good , the plot taking a back seat to breasts . the original nudie cuties as they are called were originally nudist films or films where there was no touching but as the adult industry began to grow the film makers either tried to be clever or tried to exploit something else in order to put butts in seats . the clever ones were very few which only left hacks who were of limited talent . the comedies often came off best with the humor approaching the first grade level , infantile but harmlessly fun . something that could rarely be said about any other genre cross dressed as a nudie . the ramrodder looks good and has a couple of nice pieces but its done in by being neither western nor sex film . i need not watch this again . of interest to probably no one , the rapist and killer in the film was played by bobby beausoleil , a member of the manson family who was arrested for murdering a school teacher not long after filming wrapped . obviously these sort of things will ruin some peoples lives .
not really spoilers in my opinion , but i wanted to cover myself , nevertheless . as the executive producer , morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 items or less , a movie with an intentional indie-feel , and just be absorbed in the mentor/be-all-that-you-can-be theme . he plays a alternate universe , semi-washed up version of the real morgan freeman , who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson , ca from brentwood to research his next movie role . why carson , is a mystery to so . cal residents . he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements . paz vega is pretty to watch , a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz , playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman 's research . his character is only known as `` him '' to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people- '' psst , that 's 'him , ' etc . unfortunately , i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood , carried no cash or debit card , or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him . if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does , then i got ta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has . nothing really happens in this movie . i do n't believe that either of the main character 's were substantially changed by their encounter with each other . it flirts with the idea of adultery , but then that thought fizzles . this to me was similar to steve martin 's shopgirl , without the sexual affair . it was self-indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience .
six different couples . six different love stories . six different love angles . eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater . looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen . i am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what 's going on in the movie . all stories have got no link with each other , but somewhere down the line nikhil advani trying to show some relation between them . i tried to find out a few lines i could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write . the movie is a poor copy of hollywood blockbuster love actually . my suggestion . do n't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie .
bad actors , terrible script , totally unbelievable ending - this film had it all . after seeing films like this , you wonder why the makers bothered at all . this film has absolutely nothing to say , all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films . a total waste of time .
i saw this movie the other night and i have to honestly say it 's one of the worst films i 've ever seen . the acting is fair , but the plot is totally ridiculous . a killer is born because of all the `` energy used to make the movie '' and if the film is burned the killer will die ? how unbelievable is that ? the characters were underdeveloped to say the least ... for example , all of a sudden the man mentions `` are n't you trying to complete the film because your mother could n't ? '' so we 're supposed to go along with this ? we had no idea it was her daughter until half way through the film . the movie really did n't spotlight on anyone , we did n't know anything about the main people who survived except ringwald 's character was a whiney actress , the guy was on the set when the people died and raffy wanted to be a director like her mother . not truly diving in to know who they are . seemed things were rushed to just get to the killings . the whole plot is entirely too weak for my taste and i was extremely disappointed . anyone who enjoyed this piece of crap , obviously needs to learn a thing or two about film making . i ca n't believe anyone would agree to star or even work on this picture . it 's not funny , it was not scary and was cliche through the entire film . i found myself predicting what would happen before each scene , which believe you me was n't hard at all to do . it 's a disgrace and i 'm deeply sorry i wasted an hour and a half watching the mess . 1/10 .
so they hyped the violence and it 's been branded as sick . well , the violence is the best bit i 'm afraid , but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their ( entirely predictable ) rampage . this film has a truly dreadful script . we never get a chance to get to know robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic . the acting is n't much better , either , the worst of them being the tv chef and the school teacher . the direction is clumsy , the pace enough to send you to sleep . and what on earth is the school film project all about ? a comment on the film itself perhaps ? the use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable . these guys obviously think they 're intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth . how on earth they got the great yorgos arvanitis to light it i 'll never know . and how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery . absolutely awful beyond comprehension .
i read the reviews before i watched this movie , and i did n't believe them . i love crap movies and i expected this one to be average . it was n't . this film makes camp blood 1 and 2 look like greats . the film contains bad acting , poor sound , poor confusing storyline , bad makeup- and it bored me so much i turned it off . even the nudity was rubbish ! did they even have a budget for this film ? i do n't think they did . you can tell if your gon na like this film or not in the first 5 minutes . if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood . avoid this trash - i watched it on tv and felt riped off , so do n't spend anything on it . the best part is probably the end .
after having seen the canadian/icelandic/british 2004 production of `` beowulf & grendel , '' which i thought brilliant and stunning , i approached this -- the first of 3 newer beowulf movies due out this year -- with trepidation . as soon as i heard `` viking '' and saw the horned helmets , i groaned . these were migration era swedes and danes , not vikings ( they came later ) . and even the vikings never wore horns on their helmets ( horns make it easy for your enemy to knock your helmet off and then brain you ) . then there 's hrolfgar 's palace , which looks like a set for a movie about greece or rome , not 6th-century denmark . the swords and armor look like props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods . i spotted weapons that might have been used by crusaders in `` kingdom of heaven , '' and one character was even wielding a windlass steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from `` beowulf & grendel '' ! beyond the basic plot of the original epic poem , the writing was dismal and the acting totally wooden and unconvincing . the biggest yuk was a secret-weapon crossbow , complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles , that looked like something bought from iraqi insurgents . the special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that beowulf could never have torn off an arm , as he did in the poem . thank the gods for bazooka crossbows ! i could go on , but i wo n't .
my eyes ! in the name of god and all that is holy make me unsee this movie ! what drugs are you people on ! this could very well be the worst movie ever ! i felt like i was on a bad acid trip the whole time , i need to call a therapist to help me deal with the trauma of this epic disaster . from start to finish glow ropes is an unholy masterpiece of satanic cinema . when i thought to watch this movie with my jewish best friend and his family we thought `` oh hey , this may be funny ! it will probably be bad but still a little funny '' how wrong we were , we were not prepared for how awful this movie could be . all of my friends lined up for lobotomies as soon as the film was over , and during the course of the movie , one of my friends attempted to hang himself with his belt while another tried to slit his wrists with a wooden spoon . i wish i had watched the video from the ring instead , that way the pain and suffering would be over in only seven short days . for all who wish to see this movie , you are not prepared ! you may think you are some sort of `` tough guy '' by renting this but this movie will break you , push you to the ground and urinate on you .
i 'm sure that the folks on the texas/louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when paramount 's b picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public . very simply the area along the sabine river where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the deep south or at least the deep south was post civl war . no big cattle empires there , they 're much farther west in texas , farther than richard dix and preston foster could ride to set up their empire . the film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when leo carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle , they keep the cattle . and that 's the beginning of the big ponderosa like ranch they start . along the way foster marries dix 's sister played by frances gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors . they also have some further run ins with leo carrillo . anyway , us easterners who like westerns usually do n't bother with geographical trifles and it 's still a good western from the production mill of harry sherman who produced all those hopalong cassidy westerns for paramount . the climax is a blazing , and i mean that literally , gun battle that should have maybe been used on an a production . but i would n't have any but western fans look at it .
if there was some weird inversed oscar academy awards festival this flick would win it all . it has all the gods , excellent plot , extreme special effects coupled with extremely good acting skills and of course in every role there is a celebrity superstar . well , this could be the scenario if the world was inversed , but it 's not . instead it 's the worst horror flick ever made , not only bad actors that seem to read the scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia , but also extremely low on special effects . for example the devil costume ( which by the way is a must-see ) , is something of the most hilarious i 've ever seen . whenever i saw that red-black so called monster on screen i could n't hold my laugh back . and to top of things it looked like the funny creature was transported by a conveyor-belt . do not do the same mistake as i did . checking imdb seeing that the movie was released in 2003 , had less than five votes and thinking : - '' well , it 's worth a shot , ca n't be that bad '' . yes it could . i 'm not even going to waste more words on this movie .
the excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director 's express intention , in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in china . however , i found the combination of the glacially slow 'plot ' and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating , particularly to a western audience . at times i actually had trouble telling some characters apart , as they were filmed from such a distance . two hours in and i was totally past caring . as someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of china ( and is by the way no stranger to chinese cinema ) , i could n't engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into . it begs the question : if i disliked it , who on earth would like it ? give me zhang yimou , give me chen kaige . give me the work of just about any other chinese director i 've ever seen . this sorry effort just does n't measure up at all . i 'd be sorry to see chinese cinema judged against this benchmark .
this movie is about a cop ( ching wan lau ) trying to catch a super-clever thief ( ekin cheng ) who blackmails an insurance company headed by a kelly lin . basically , whatever plans the cop tries the thief somehow knows them beforehand . this movie , covered by handsome lead actors , beautiful lead actress and good camera shots of hong kong scenes , really has no substance at all . it 's all flash , and the flash quickly becomes dull too . i lost all interests a third of the way into the movie , and there is no redeeming quality after that , except for the cinematography , which looks good . only consider seeing this movie if you can do so for free . also , consider stopping watching the movie 20 minutes into the movie because it 's all the same to the end : boring . 6/10
i was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people - maggie smith , a very young bob newhart and , of course , peter ustinov . my disappointment was thus compounded to discover the film does n't work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film . ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large american corporation based in london . bluffing his way past dimwitted ceo karl malden and tech geek newhart , ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the 'perfect heist ' part of the film . to do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe . and here is problem one . his perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid . his lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras . the second problem is the heist ( fraud really ) happens within the first 30 minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension . maggie smith is sadly miscast as ustinov 's ditsy next door neighbor/secretary who just ca n't keep a job . i love maggie smith but she just seems too together here , too composed , the part called for more of a wacky , physical comedian . furthermore , ustinov and smith have no chemistry together , maybe it 's the age difference , but the later romantic relationship , as devoid of actual romance as it is , still comes off a little creepy . ustinov co-wrote the script , and it was thought well of at the time , but i found it unfunny , meandering and a sad waste of a great cast .
now i had the best intentions when watching this one . i like some of tony scott 's work , also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie , even though i heard otherwise from other people . but this was simply hopeless . in my humble opinion , tony scott was trying too hard . it was all just too much . allow me to elaborate . miss knightley was overacting , and not in a good way . the people who did perform well , were mickey rourke , edgar ramirez , and christopher walken , but their screen time just was n't able to save the movie . there were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality , yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer . a certain tune was used around 4 times , which really started to bug after the second time . i 'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once . also , the editing really went out on this one , as the cutting rate is rather high . oh , and the repetitive echoing of some of keira 's lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second , third , fourth time , and so on . basically , my opinion is that if you want to see an action-flick that is high-paced and `` somewhat '' funny , and you do n't care about everything i mentioned above , you might like it . ( on a side note : i 'm not a keira knightley fan . )
this is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers , eating pizza , and laugh at . unfortunately for me i found myself watching this one alone . my friends and i rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one . it was due back and i figured that it was a waste not to watch it . so i did , and i was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is . now , i love bad movies quite a bit , and i probably would have liked this one if the `` hero '' was n't so utterly loathsome . the entire movie i was hoping that he 'd put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him ! he does very little heroic things in the movie . he 's a beefy , disgusting , stupid thing . he has less redeeming qualities than the villains do . and what was it with all the naked chicks ? i mean , i love naked chicks just as much as the next guy , but this movie went a tad overboard in that department . well , anyway , if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting `` hero '' then i 'm sure you 'll like this schlock of a film .
ok - i adore this film ... i will credit this movie - alone - for making me such a die-hard horror fanatic . i could never watch this movie alone . i 've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it 's original release at the theatres , on its viewers . incredible masterpiece .... horrible , psychological stuff scares the pants off me .oh bless their hearts , whoever made this awesome film . i love it . i thought the whole film was decent and interesting . this movie is so scary - this is the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life ! not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough , but what always got me - was brendan 's fabulous acting . best horror film ever . nothing can ever be this scary again . halloween viewing at its evilest .
this is the worst ripoff of home alone movies that i have ever seen ! watch part 1 and two , but do n't let anyone say that this is better than the first two ! i mean , really , you do n't make a movie , then make a sequel with the same characters and actors , and then make another sequel with different characters and actors ! i mean , it would have been ok if this wa n't a `` home alone '' movie , but they did make it a home alone movie . culkin is too old now , so you 're suppose to stop making sequels ! goodness , this movie makes me sick ! buy part 1 and 2 .
this was yet another big screen outing for a us tv show from the sixties it is amusing enough but was very much to formula . intelligent martian lands on earth and meets the not too bright humans , in his view . the usual wackiness ensues with the human , bridges , eventually bonds with him and helps him to get home . along the way he also gets the girl , hannah . this is a nice outing for some pleasant hollywood stars who i had not seen for a while . pleasant enough to pass some spare time if you have not got anything better to view .
although the director tried ( the filming was made in tynisia and morocco ) , this attempt to transport the new testament in the screen failed.the script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies , while the duration is very long.but the most tragic is the protagonist chris sarandon , who does n't seem to understand the demands of his role .
no cinematic achievements here , however that 's not even the important question . how does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie -- and star vehicle ? the formula requires the cute female lead a la ryan or aniston -- check ; there 's a built-in tv audience ! add thick-headed , compliant men , usually including the problem ex-boyfriend/fiancée -- check . assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars . so far , so good . what is the male lead to consist of ? he has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience ( and the gay flight stewards ) instantly swoon . but ... he can not be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience , and he ca n't outshine the star . roll cameras ... the problem is messing thinks she 's still in a sitcom ... she has only one presentation : as the wide-eyed doormat that she 's made a career out of . a capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene , where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds . you ca n't help feeling good for mulroney ... you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this . he 's gotten all the respect of a lifetime .260 hitter . this time , he smacks one out to the warning track , and no one can figure out what to do , as he amusedly takes home plate .
this was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store . do n't make the same mistake i did . this movie is tedious , unconvincingly acted , and generally boring . the dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered ; i cringed at every scene they shared . dennis hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self ; his role was clearly not a stretch for him . and although the movie is supposedly set in puerto rico , it feels a lot more like a hollywood movie lot ; all of the main characters are caucasian and several tend to speak english with pseudo-irish accents . odd . anyway , when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store , keep walking .
this movie had some andrenaline kickers , but it 's an old story that simply could never happen . navy protocols could never break down that much that a crew much less an xo could ever go that far against the captain . i 'll take dr. strangelove any day if i wish to see this plot . sidenote -- the us navy did not support this film .
wow , a movie about nyc politics seemingly written by someone who has never set foot in nyc . you know there 's a problem when at one moment you expect the credits to roll and the movie continues on for another half hour . the characters are boring , john cusack 's accent is laughable , and the plotline teeters between boring and laughable . a horrible movie .
there 's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland , and robot wars does deliver . sure , the acting is lousy , the dialogue is sub-par , and the characters are one-dimensional , but it has giant robots ! the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period . they are certainly not as polished as today 's standards , but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures , so it has aged fairly well . its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime , and it does have a certain tongue-in-cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable . i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction .
after finally viewing this movie in its entirety , i am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike . is it the worst western ever ? no , i would n't say that . but `` the last great american western '' , a phrase i saw applied to it more than once ? not even close . a movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue , and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that i 've ever seen . the movie can be measured in groaners per minute ; as in , how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life ? there 's so many instances of this that it 's distracting . cheesy lines come at you in waves ; predictable , unoriginal , and often . if bad dialogue does n't bother you , then how about bad gunfights ? few westerns can show you gunfighting that 's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously . it 's okay if there 's a comic edge to such gunfighting , such as in silverado , but in tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good westerns . the final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score , but by then , i was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving . other than those flaws , i can say the visuals are stunning - the movie 's well shot and the settings all look great . the acting is passable , especially considering what the actors were given to work with . however , if you 're looking for the last great american western , do yourself a favor - go rent unforgiven instead . 3 out of 10
well , first off , if you 're checking out revolt of the zombies as some very early night of the living dead ( 1968 ) -type film , forget it . this is about `` zombies '' in a more psychological sense , where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will , but who must instead follow the will of another . the `` zombies '' here , as little as they are in the film , are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general , as in wartime . it is quite a stretch to call this a horror film . the film is set during world war i . a `` french cambodian '' contingent had heard strange stories about zombification -- supposedly angkor wat was built by utilizing zombies -- and there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes . armand louque ( dean jagger ) brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification , but he wo n't talk . so louque and an international military contingent head to angkor wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to `` wipe out the white race '' . one of the odd things about revolt of the zombies is that it seems like maybe writer/director victor halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script . the film begins as if it will explore the zombie/military metaphor , and maybe even have adventure elements , but after about 15 minutes , it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story . halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power ( and a nietzschean `` will to power '' ) . the film is interesting on that level , but the script and the editing are very choppy . this is yet another older film for which i would n't be surprised if there is missing footage , especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialogue . amidst the contrived romance story , halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread , but little of the zombie material makes much sense . louque discovers the secret of zombification , but it does n't mean much to the viewer . the mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusinghalperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of bela lugosi 's googly-eyes from his 1932 film , white zombie , but never explains what it has to do with anything . there are big gaps in the plot , including the love story . promising , interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time . one potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before he gets to do much . if you 're a big fan of old , creaky b movies , revolt of the zombies may be worth watching at least once -- the acting is n't all that bad , and if you 've got a good imagination , you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps . but this is the second time i 've seen the film , with the first only being about five years ago , and i could barely recall anything about it -- so it 's not exactly memorable .
one of the most common entries in the 'goofs ' category is anachronism . though i 'm beginning to believe that anachronism and other goofs are more acceptable , even ignored , in very good films , but are found front and center in rotten films . kiss them for me is a rotten film and reeks of anachronism , yet when watching it closely , i found almost nothing specifically anachronistic . the shots of aircraft which bookend the film are certainly out of place . the big 4 engine transport seen after the title `` honolulu 1944 '' appears to be the post war c-97 stratofreighter ( in mats colors ) . the combat planes seen taking off from the carrier at the end are douglas skyraiders which entered service after ww2 and were made famous by their service in vietnam . but excepting these two pieces of film and , of course , the hairstyles , everything else is very possibly period authentic . it just 'feels ' so wrong . i 'm an admirer of stanley donen , we share the same birthday . in his co directed on the town ( 1949 ) there is a car chase at the end with the police driving 1949/50 ford 's yet there is n't the slightest feeling that this is out of place in a ww2 period film . in fact , as i reflected later , there is n't anything which says that this is supposed to be a ww2 period film . it just feels that way . based on a wartime broadway musical which was based on a ballet ( fancy free ) which may have been based on the work of artist paul cadmus ( the fleet 's in ! 1934 ) its a great film about sailors on a 24 hour pass in new york and , so heavy with wartime associations , its merely assumed it takes place during the war and yet these contemporary cars do nothing to break the spell . the first problem is old cary grant . though far too old to represent a navy sbd dive bomber pilot , it is a hollywood tradition for stars like grant , gary cooper ( lou gehrig ) , jimmy stewart ( charles lindbergh ) to play younger . it was the role which he is miscast in , not his age . he plays an operator , as they used to call them . a guy who gets things done and breaks all the rules while doing it yet remains admired and loved for it . a hustler . a wheeler dealer . a de rigueur character in a service comedy . grant is the comic center of what is after all supposed to be a service comedy which is contra to his comedy style . thinking back on the great grant comic performances like bringing up baby ( 1938 ) or arsenic and old lace ( 1944 ) and he is the great reactor whose comedy is to be reduced by his context from dignity to a befuddled puddle of inert jelly . in kiss them he is expected to be the comic spark plug which just is n't him . people had already been exposed to the type , most recently to comic phil silvers as sgt . bilko on television . the role would be perfected later by james garner but here grant just is n't funny and appears to be a bully getting his way by aggressively pushing his cary grantness rather than cajoling and finessing . but the thing which really stinks the place up with anachronism is the lead women . there can be no more echt 50s women than suzy parker and jayne mansfield . they are unique to the decade . marilyn monroe can be placed in a continuum with carole lombard and marie wilson and any number of dumb blonds , and grace kelly was another high class dame ( think of mary astor ) , but there never could have been an anatomically exaggerated woman in films like mansfield . sure there were the 'sweater girls ' ( e.g . lana turner ) of ww2 , but mansfield was stretching the point . suzy parker was the model who revolutionized the model business , who changed the mannequin like poses to become the first natural girl who moved and whose personality was captured by the camera ( see funny face ( 1957 ) also by stanley donen ) . of course in high 50s style , there seems to be a lot of gender mixing at 'wild ' parties but never even a hint of sex ( think of the 50s tv shows bachelor father or the bob cummings show where dinner jacketed men returned from 'dates ' alone ) . the original book , which i have n't read , was published during the war and appeared as a play on broadway at the end of the war and the nuances of the situation must have been inescapable for contemporary readers and audiences , but broken down , bowdlerized and reconstituted a dozen years later and fatally miscast , it remains a once forgotten stain on otherwise exemplary careers until the invention of the vcr and cable television resurrected this petrified turkey . so the lesson here is whatever the 'goof ' it will be ignored in a great film like citizen kane ( who actually hears charles foster kane say 'rosebud ' ? ) , and tolerated in fun dreck like westworld ( why were the robots given live ammunition in the first place ? ) but absolutely despised in a rotten film , even if the goofs are really non existent .
i gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open-ended and left unexplained , and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way , plus scenes of a decaying corpse . neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner . the film 's plot , such as it is , concerns three loosely interconnecting stories , none of which conclude satisfactorily . the bounty hunter , played by bruce dern , is the character that connects all three vignettes . first we have dylan mcdermott , looking darn fine , as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter , when he rides through a border town and spots a sad-faced saloon girl played by helen hunt . then we have one of the hemingway girls , not sure which one , playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman , an attractive redhead , whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long . the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him , with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension .
this movie is hilarious , not in good way . the fights are awfully bad done , while sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones , and even this happens only two or three times , definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie . a gunfight means a hero can walk into an open field with 10 people shooting at him with uzi 's , pick up a gun , start shooting back and not get hurt . the story empty , guy waking up , lost his memory , starts fighting cos that 's what he 's good at . five years later memories come back , takes revenge blablabla . not worth your buck , not really worth your time unless you 're drunk and bored .
another vast conspiracy movie that tries to blame the us government and the armed forces ( especially the army ) for every disaster since the great flood . anyone who has ever served time in the us military can see how bogus this film is . uniforms , equipment , sets , and mannerisms are all wrong . ( and of course , all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total idiots . ) blatant propaganda with no attempt at objectivity . most of the theories presented have been disproven over the past few years . uses every cliche ' , rumor , and urban legend from the gulf-all are presented as gospel . ( the truth is , no one knows for sure why some gw vets are sick and others are healthy as horses . ) ps this is not new . war is not fun and i know wwii , korean , and viet nam vets with some pretty serious ailments , too . ( and the government has the responsibility to take care of all of them . ) sensationalistic movies like this will not solve the problem !
the producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie . they should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker . a young couple moves into a house , where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived . extremely boring , and very predictable . in the end i ended up not caring about anyone in this movie . avoid this one at all costs .
... there 's no one else watching the movie . my husband and i went to watch it last night . it 's just a small theater , but there 's usually a decent amount of people there . not this time ! my husband and i were the only people watching dragon wars last night ! now we know why . the movie was by far one of the worst i 've ever seen . yes , the cg was good , but that was it . the acting , script & dialog , directing , editing , etc . was god-awful ! since we were alone in the room , we felt free to talk during the movie . that is , we talked about how bad it was , that it reminded us of the mighty morphin power rangers , godzilla , mortal combat and the lord of the rings . it was like we expected to see rita and lord zed portraying commanders of sauron 's army . the creatures were ridiculous . you ca n't just introduce legions of dino/dragon/lizard things loaded down with cannons without explanation . the lord of the rings has a wide spectrum of characters , but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies , not in an hour and a half . the scene transitions are horrible . i did n't fall asleep during the movie , but even though it was an overly simple plot , i found myself getting lost in the plot holes . the characters were caucasian americans , but spoke almost with broken english because of the badly written dialog in the script . the final scene that could have redeemed some value of the movie ... failed . ethan did n't cry when sarah died ... though he had n't known her for very long during this life anyways . he did n't seem too upset to be left in `` mordor '' , not knowing where he was or how to get back . we could n't for the love of god figure out where he was or how he got there either , but if he was n't upset we should n't be either . oh , and why did the dress that sarah 's spirit was wearing look like she borrowed it from queen elizabeth ? one more thing ... all 3 of the main hero characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job . sarah completes her task and moves on to the afterlife . jack does this as well . then why does ethan get screwed ? he 's left alone , without the girl , without a map/compass/helicopter to help him get back . what 's he supposed to do ? send smoke signals ? and if he gets back home , does he just go back to his job ? he should have been given the same mercy of getting killed out of the movie that the other heroes had . do n't waste your time or money on this movie . we only stayed til the end because we 'd paid for it , but as soon as the credits hit , we were out the door .
this is absurd - aside from the fellow australian who has reviewed this flick , i ca n't help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of elektra , considering how generous they were with their praise . admittedly i 'm not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversions so i did n't go in with many expectations , yet still i found elektra to be incredibly underwhelming . the thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was so much in this film which went by unexplained , that left you thinking `` huh , what relevance does that have to the plot ? '' or `` so how did that aspect of the character come about ? '' i can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in daredevil , which i have no intention of seeing . furthermore , the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about-face at random moments to suit the storyline , and do n't even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub-plot . i 'm also ( still ) scratching my head over the fate of cary-hiroyuki tagawa 's character , which seems to have gone by unexplained . if i can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot , but otherwise i gained little enjoyment from elektra . i know we 're supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy/action films , but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing ( even by action film standards ) that it simply frustrated me . well , hell , at least jennifer garner looks damn good .
the story idea behind the lost missile is n't bad at all , but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub-par level . the film begins with a missile heading towards the earth . in a panic because it 's about to strike the earth , the soviets manage to deflect the object . this is n't necessarily good , however , as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path and the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet . in other words , with each pass it makes , a swath of death follows -- one that could potentially kill us all ! ! so , it 's up to the good scientists of the us ( led by a very young and hardly recognizable robert loggia ) to formulate and plan to save us -- and especially save new york that is in its immediate flight path ! unfortunately , they are n't able to save ottawa ( i 've never been there , so i ca n't say whether or not this is a big loss ) but thanks to good old american know-how , they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction ! ! so , as you can see , the story idea is n't bad and rather original . but , so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding . overall , a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like -- all others , see it at your own risk .
this film was more effective in persuading me of a zionist conspiracy than a muslim one . and i 'm jewish . anbody go to journalism school ? read an editorial ? freshman year rhetoric ? these alarmist assertions , presented in a palatable way , might prove persuasive . but by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments , nor viable ( or any at all ) solutions , few sources and each of dubious origin , makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe . and thank goodness for that -- i would n't want anyone to leave the theatre believing any of this racist claptrap . a good lesson for me -- and hopefully a cautionary tale for you -- to actually read about a film before seeing it .
this is waaaaay to much .. so frustrating to watch .. i was waiting for the whole damn movie to end and to finally get some answers ! ! .. and what i 've had in the end was nothing but a huuuge neon-sign question mark above my head ! ! ! ! ! i have n't seen such a bad acting and such a nonsense movie in a long long time .. and what 's bothering me is .. how come someone ( an actor ) read the script of such a bull ! ? # @ movie and say : ok , i 'm in ! ! ! let 's film this ! this is horrible ! ! ! this movie suuuuuuuuuuuucks ! ! ! ! ! ! i just ca n't believe i 've spent an hour and a half of my life on something like this ! ! !
i was in physical pain watching the eyes of the cast as they participated in this sham . bad dialogue , worse ( worst ) acting , lifeless all the way , and the cast knew it . the two preceding movies which this attempted to copy had life , sparkle , and were captivating .
i 've never been a huge fan of mormon films . being a mormon , i 've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos . i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air , the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my non-mormon friends . boy , was i wrong . i figured , since this had b-list talent like clint howard , gary coleman , andrew wilson , and fred willard ( one of my favorites ) , this would have to be at least a little funny . and besides , church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such . but i must say , throughout the entire movie , it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing . every joke fell flat , and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored . the dialogue was bland , and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen . every single character but wilson 's was less than one-dimensional . it 's hard to believe that after nine re-writes the film was still as mind-numbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed . i ca n't put into words the rage i felt sitting through this . my friends and i were extras in the final game scene , so we went to the premiere in washington city , ut . kurt hale , the director , was there , and i must say , i avoided all contact with him after the show . he waited at the door , seemingly ready for feedback . i could n't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life , but it left a nasty , painful scar that i will never forget . here are a few specific problems i had : there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player , but these two characters came out of nowhere , and were impossible to care about , so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame , uninteresting characters . there were many subplots that popped up every now and then , each promising the audience the chance for laughs , but each one came and went in a puff of smoke , ending before you could even start caring . this was pretty much how the whole movie felt . this film was a major letdown , and i feel bad for everyone who 's expecting the first real funny mormon movie . true , the jokes in this one are n't too exclusive to mormons . then again , it 's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears . please , do not see this movie . keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious . spare yourself the disappointment i went through
if this movie were more about piper perabo 's character and less about the bar , this might have been halfway decent . piper 's violet stanford and karen friendly ( adventures of rocky and bullwinkle ) both have a virgin kindegarden teacher quality to them that 's endearing . here 's hoping she 'll find a better movie to be in .
it 's interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film . but the problem is that it 's not very good . there was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented , the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you did n't bother for any of them . rather bland ( and sometimes downright bad ) photo leaves a bit to be desired but i guess you ca n't expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it . it 's unfair to review the film and compare it to other high-budget films . but alas , that is what one must do . on its own , it 's not very good . and compared to others , it 's still not very good . but it is not without its good points ! i liked the plot . it was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end . sometimes in the really dark scenes , it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well . however in the end the film fails to impress . the characters are pretty much non-existent and we do n't care for any of them . any of them might die , but it 's possible to pinpoint the final `` survivor '' from very early on .
one of , if not the worst film to come out of britain in the 80s . this tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces ' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it . in turns gratuitous , puerile , uncouth and unrealistic , this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny , provocative , intellectual and controversial . perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of george costigan , michelle holmes and siobhan finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script . it 's no surprise that this was the late andrea dunbar 's only work to make it onto the screen . complete and utter rubbish on every level .
surely one of the most ill-advised remakes of a classic in film history – especially since the promise of its tag-line , “ the most beautiful woman of our time in the most erotic adventure of all time ” , isn ’ t even properly exploited ! although this film was regularly shown on tv in my neck of the woods since my childhood days , its notoriety ( for awfulness not erotic content , mind you ) kept me away from it until now – and i only relented because i have recently enjoyed bo derek ’ s previous film , 10 ( 1979 ) , and have been watching a lot of fantasy stuff as well over the christmas period . lead actress/producer bo derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirl-ish sexual innocent ( witness the inept banana scene ) and , as was to be expected , she is made to get her clothes off a few times but , as welcome as these scenes were , she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here ; richard harris , then , chews the scenery incessantly as jane ’ s obsessed explorer father , but john philip law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in jane herself ; newcomer miles o ’ keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie , is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel ( which is probably lifted from johnny weissmuller anyway ! ) and , furthermore , is as inexpressive as one of the trees he dangles from at regular intervals throughout the film ’ s second half ! ; for the record , he later starred in two ator movies ( or would-be conan imitators ) for joe d ’ amato and the king arthur-era set , sword of the valiant ( 1984 ) . when still an actor , director john derek ( who also serves as his own cinematographer here ) had worked with some good film-makers ( cecil b . de mille , william dieterle and robert rossen ) and a few great ones ( otto preminger , nicholas ray and don siegel ) but he clearly learned zilch from them as his direction of this one is a major liability : appallingly pretentious at times ( witness the perfectly horrid python attack sequence ) with a senseless overuse of the slow motion technique and cheesy transitions ; this was derek ’ s seventh film as a director ( and his second of four with wife bo ) and , eventually , he would only get to make two more . the film ’ s utter failure only needs to be gauged by the fact that the tarzan legend was tackled once more on film – in greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes ( which , surprisingly enough , i haven ’ t watched myself yet ) – a mere three years later ! ! nominated for six razzie awards ( including john derek , richard harris and miles o ’ keeffe ) and winning one for bo derek herself , tarzan , the ape man was co-written by gary goddard , the future director of another highly anticipated but ultimately disappointing transposition to the silver screen of a ( this time animated ) heroic figure , master of the universe ( 1987 ) which i will be revisiting presently as well ( yay ) ! despite a charming closing credit sequence showing tarzan and jane playing with around with an orang-utan and a music score that is not half bad actually and quite rousing on occasion , any belated good intentions are defeated by an extremely silly climax involving natives painting bo completely white and , fatally , john derek ’ s clear disinterest in the character of tarzan himself which makes him come off as an unimportant supporting character in his own self-titled movie ! !
i can not believe the same guy directed this crap and dracula 2000 . dracula 2000 was innovative , fresh , and well written , if poorly acted . this pile ca n't even claim that . it starts with the defeat of dracula at the end of dracula 2000 . then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that . following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow , but craven chose to go in the style of his older films , having no good tie but the main villain 's name . even the actor playing dracula was different ( going from dark hair in dracula 2000 to a blonde here ) . avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies .
i completely agree with the other comment someone should do a what 's up tiger lily with this film . it has to be one of the worst french films i 've seen in a long time ( actually along with brotherwood of the wolves , 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of time ) . it 's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun . antoine decaunes in particular and jean rochefort being among my darlings , i was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film . lou doyon is quite bad , as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they do n't necessarily give you talent . avoid this film , if you want to laugh watch an alain chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like la fille de d'artagnan .
follow-up to 1973 's far better `` cleopatra jones '' has statuesque black actress tamara dobson returning to her signature role as chic , super-tough narcotics agent , here busting a heroin ring in hong kong . cross-pollination of blaxploitation action-flick and kung-fu b-movie is fun at the outset but eventually flags . the shoot-out finale is right off the assembly-line , and dobson herself seems less energetic than before ( she 's still sexy , and she puts a unique spin on her comically-stilted dialogue , but these surroundings may have been too much of one thing for her -- she 's jaded ) . stella stevens plays the villainess this time ; she 's good , but ca n't match shelley winters in the predecessor . * * from * * * *
i once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck , such as rambo 3 , baise moi , deep impact ) - but mr. seidl almost succeeded . hundstage was a truly awful experience . anyone who sees this movie will think that austrians are a miserable , pathetic bunch of retards . it shows a world where love and humanity do n't exist , a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence . by choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors ( most of them look like straight from the imagination of austrian shock-cartoonist deix ) director seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in austrian ( european ? western ? ) suburbs . the viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies , violence against women and handicapped people , madness and degradation . but this is n't social criticism . this is just pure shock without any aesthetic value . instead you get bad acting , bad cinematography , bad filmmaking . if anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes . this is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer . and it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way . it shows ugly people - that is not the reason why i hate it . but it depicts average people in an ugly , misanthropic way . and this is why this film is truly despicable .
`` fungicide '' is quite possibly the most incompetent , embarrassing , pitiful `` film '' i have ever seen . the acting is criminal , the direction practically non-existent , and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computer . far be it from me to stifle creativity , but i actually believe things like this should n't be made . i am sure the `` film '' -makers will say that , yes , the `` film '' was hampered by a low ( as in nothing ) budget - but in that case they just really should n't have bothered . as it is , they have offered the world something so dire , so execrable , that only imbeciles could get the merest shade of enjoyment from it . starting the `` movie '' it was n't as though i was expecting `` citizen kane '' or anything . i was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness , a hint of fun , and even some energy . what i got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief . the plot ? well , our leering antihero scientist , who works in his parents ' basement , is seen manically stirring some goo in a cup . apparently , such high-level science is the end-result of years of research . his parents then send him off to a strange hotel-type place in the countryside to relax . there are some other people there , who are simply too awful to write about . anyway , the scientist drops his test-tube onto some mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people . ( wow , i 'm getting suicidal just writing the plot summary ) . our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar ( by attaching a `` fuse '' - really a piece of string - to it ) . the barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon , destroying all the mushrooms . the end . ( thank goodness ) . that summary is as good as the `` film '' gets ( and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is ) . it really should never have got past this stage of development ( by which i mean a plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayons ) . somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a vigorous shake and said `` no . '' and those `` special '' effects . well , they 're `` special '' all right . this is cgi gone crazy . and done by a person who i can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology . and when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home computer graphics package , they are represented by actors shuffling along covered in a sheet ( i kid you not ) . one of the most inexcusable things about the movie is its laziness . this can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns ( a la clint eastwood ) and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets . i mean come on , a couple of retakes and he could have pulled it off , but just to leave it as it is - really weak . i can not believe money was spent on this camcorder-shot rubbish . the `` film '' -makers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty metres of any movie-making equipment . i also think it 's wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto imdb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the `` movie . '' `` fungicide '' is an absolute travesty of film-making . mr wascavage is either very , very stupid or very , very cynical .
an italian/american co-production co-starring linda blair and david 'the hoff ' hasselhoff : how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat ? well , based on the uneventful , extremely tedious , and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so , i would have said 'very easily ' ; thankfully , however , things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes , and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy , a smattering of nudity too ( unfortunately , my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material ) . the hoff stars as gary , a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend leslie ( leslie cumming ) to a run-down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project , a book about witches ; whilst there , frustrated gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving leslie of her virginity . his plans for nookie are scuppered , however , by the unexpected arrival of property developers freddie and rose brooks ( robert champagne and annie ross ) , their pregnant daughter jane ( blair ) , son tommy ( michael manchester ) , pretty nymphomaniac architect linda sullivan ( catherine hickland ) , and estate agent jerry ( rick farnsworth ) , who have come to inspect the island 's hotel . after explaining their unexpected presence on the island , gary and leslie are welcomed by the property 's new owners , and when a violent storm suddenly picks up , making it perilous to return to the mainland , everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building . unfortunately , unbeknownst to the hotel 's new guests , the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch ( hildegard knef ) , who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life . one by one , victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex ( which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs ) , before meeting a terrible fate . none of this makes much sense , and the acting is atrocious ( manchester as tommy is particularly bad , whilst hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers , which speaks volumes about the others ) , but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore : rose has her lips sewn together , before being roasted alive in a fireplace ; jerry is crucified and burnt alive ; linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish ( ! ! ) ; freddie 's veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood ; and gary gets stabbed in the back . oh , and leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and blair gets possessed ( again ) .
without a doubt one of the worst movies i 've seen in recent years . the story focuses on four women driven to robbing banks who we are somehow supposed to sympathize with . it 's tough to sympathize with characters who keep making such stupid decisions . oh no , the cops are on to us , they know who we are , what do we do ? ... let 's rob one more bank then we 're outta here ! what ! ? ! every character is a stereotype and it 's easy to tell who 's gon na end up dead .
this `` movie '' is such a bad work ! nothing seems to even try and be realistic . plot is weak , acting - miserable , actors wondering around like in a 1st year production , trying very hard to act with no chance at all from the beginning . what a flop ! what a waste of time , money and effort to all concerned including the audience . well , as in any thriller , here too are murders , corpses and blood . just imagine someone who 5 minutes ago , committed a murder with a knife , and came out calm and smiling , not to mention clean as a whistle , as if slashing one 's throat is done by a virtual agent . also , this murder was supposed to be done by a tiny fragile woman on a high strong male , and she cut his throat ! ! ! did she ask him , politely , to bend down for her ? much more stupidity of that same kind is going on and on leaving the audience wondering if this meant to be a joke which just turned out to be a bad one . continuity is another huge problem as for instance : the eager-hungry groom is lying in bed , waiting for his virgin-bride to get out of the bathroom and after a long while , falls asleep ( ! ? ! ) . next scene opens with the young couple entering the reception-area , asking for guidance to scenery spots ! not a word about last night ? ? ? such a waste of time even to try and write about this low-low supposed-to-be `` movie '' .
except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads , this movie is really , really bad . the cheap production values do n't help . of course , you would n't really notice that the production values are cheap if they did n't keep trying to convince you they had a production values to begin with . even for a b-movie genre freak like myself , this movie really sucks .
`` after the atomic bombs carried by a shot-down soviet bomber explode in the arctic , the creature 'gammera ' is released from his hibernation . the giant prehistoric turtle proceeds on a path to tokyo and destroys anything in his path . the military and the scientific community rush to find a means to stop this monster before tokyo is laid to waste , '' according to the dvd sleeve 's synopsis . the re-produced for american audiences version of this , the first film in the `` gamera '' series , adds english language material that is even funnier than the regularly dubbed japanese fare . clearly , the monster is following in the footsteps of `` godzilla '' . taking his cue from abc 's faddish `` batman ! '' tv series , musician wes farrell 's ludicrous theme song heightens the us version 's camp appeal . * * * gammera the invincible ( 12/15/66 ) sandy howard , noriaki yuasa ~ dick o'neill , brian donlevy , albert dekker , john baragrey
a disappointing film . the story established our protagonist as chrissy , a 'young ' , rather sullen individual drifting , not doing much . actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it did n't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives . it 's a pity though , chrissy seem like interesting character . story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated . so the question now is , when are we going to see the campions , jacksons , and the tamahori 's breaking ground with compelling , cinematically-told stories that will inspire , rather than entertain for the toll of two hours ? technically , a disgusting shot film .
one night i was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and `` gymkata '' happened to be on ; i watched way too much of it . it is indeed hilarious , and horrifying , really . think about it this way -- if in your job you had an idea for something this bad and went on to execute it in as terrible a fashion as this , how long exactly would you last ? not as long as this movie . it 's a must-see , obviously .
ok , so it was written in 1996 , before 9/11 , so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the cia director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world , is prescient . that 's it . that 's the good stuff . the acting ... fair . the plot ... silly . the `` twist '' ... unnecessary . dooooooooooom it is n't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated . do n't you think bureaucrats have a manual for `` plagues '' and how to contain them ? proper execution of such a plan is always a problem , as we saw after katrina . but they have a plan . it is n't to send them off to iceland and then to mauritania . and if the virus is carried in the air , why was the plane door open and the `` shooters ' standing there with no protection ? in fact , did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs ? that would stop her . but not as dramatic . i 'm a sucker . i always watch a movie to see the end , once i started it . but this was a waste of time , and for the most part , predictable . i saw it using a recorder so i did n't have to watch all the ads , that was a plus . it 's a good example of why i watch so little network tv . rubbish .
i went to see `` evening '' because of the cast . i 'd gone to see `` norman 's room '' for that reason -- that movie offering diane keaton , leonardo de caprio and , also , meryl streep -- and had loved every minute of it . same for `` the notebook '' even though it was chick-flit lite . and my feeling was , anything offering performances by vanessa redgrave , meryl streep , patrick wilson and glenn close would be at least as good . instead , i found sometimes even the greatest actors can not overcome trite , simplistic and -- on one occasion -- truly offensive material . now i had no problem with the way the film was structured . i actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story ... so long as one era illuminates the other and vise verse . but while vanessa 's character being on her deathbed and recalling a past event she felt `` was a mistake '' was riveting , at times , the part actually showing what that `` past mistake '' was does nothing to clarify the matter . in fact , it makes it seem meaningless in the silliest `` girl meets boy , girl gets boy , girl loses boy '' fashion , and in the most unbelievable , clichéd , wrong-headed way possible . and from here be spoilers , so bear that in mind should you continue reading . first of all , claire danes was brutally miscast . not only does she not even begin to resemble vanessa redgrave as a young woman , she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting . do n't get me wrong , she can be good in the right role -- just not this one . and patrick wilson was miscast , though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off . he 'd have been better suited to the part hugh dancy played -- the rich confused wasp -- and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all ; he 's a bit too wasp-y for that . hugh dancy ? one note -- `` i 'm a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why . '' and the `` why '' ( i 'm a closet case in a sexually repressed world , so i have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone i know ) was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died ( as you knew he would because that 's the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the fifties ) so ludicrous , wrong-headed and mishandled , i nearly threw my candy at the screen . as for the modern part between toni collette and her sister , her fear of commitment , her jealousy of her sister 's `` perfect life , '' her sister wondering if she 's made the right choices , her pregnancy and her too-perfect boyfriend ( which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by patrick wilson , and ebon moss-bachrach might have been a more interesting harris , given his dreamy eyes ) -- anyway , all this was hashed over in the 70 's and 80 's . and in much greater depth . do we really have to present it , again , and all as if it was fresh and momentous ? and to top it off , meryl streep does n't even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie , all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions . she 's still good , but only because she 's meryl , and meryl can find a way to pull off even the silliest dialog under the heaviest of makeup . so to put it simply , this movie has every cliché in the `` really meaningful message '' movie book , and it adds a few that really had no business being trotted out , again . at two hours long and laced with `` lifetime movie-of-the-week '' music that is guaranteed to rub you raw , it 's a complete failure in both the `` meaningful '' and `` moviemaking '' aspects . i give it `` 3 '' only because of meryl and vanessa . now , if all you require from your films is twadd le , then please set my comments about `` evening '' aside and have the time of your life . but if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings , rent `` norman 's room '' and find out what truly great acting is .
enough is enough ... sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead . the first tremors movie was great . the second one was ridiculous . the third one was nauseating . the tv series was depressingly awful . and this movie just drives the stake deeper . basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry , now we have the series set in the wild west , in the 1800 's , and they fight graboids . like a rehash of the first one , they have to learn how to beat them all over again . mildly entertaining i suppose . otherwise this straight-to-video release , just like tremors 2 and 3 , is just going way too far . oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place ... did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event ? i think something like this would be history-making , so our pals in the first film would n't be so unprepared . movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy . avoid this garbage .
but there are not too many of them . probably the worst `` major release '' film i have seen in my life . definitely the worst for this year . there is no point in commenting on the plot , the cast or the acting . the problem is beyond all that . it lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind ( not the funny kind ) of everything that takes place on the screen . i do n't know why i gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10 . probably , because of steven martini . he really did try . bottom line - 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells . avoid at any cost .
if you hate redneck accents , you 'll hate this movie . and to make it worse , you see patrick swayze , a has been trying to be a redneck . i really ca n't stand redneck accents . i like billy bob thornton , he was good in slingblade , but he was annoying in this movie . and what kind of name is lonnie earl ? how much more hickish can this movie get ? the storyline was stupid . i 'm usually not this judgemental of movies , but i could n't stand this movie . if you want a good billy bob thornton movie , go see slingblade . my mom found this movie for $ 5.95 at wal mart ... figures ... i think i 'll wrap it up and give it to my grandma for christmas . it could just be that i ca n't stand redneck accents usually , or that i ca n't stand patrick swayze . maybe if patrick swayze was n't in it . i did n't laugh once in the movie . i laugh at anything stupid usually . if they had shown someones fingers getting smashed , i might have laughed . people 's fingers getting smashed by accident always makes me laugh .
the '60s is an occasionally entertaining film , most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film . it is extremely uneven , and includes many annoying elements . take for instance the switch between black & white , and color . if done right , this could of been fairly effective , but because it was done poorly , it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience ; much of the film had an odd feel to it . the acting was n't extremely bad for a made for tv flick , but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times . many of the events were not coherent , and ending up being confusing . how did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960 's ? the ending was much too sappy for my tastes ; because it was hollywoodized , everything had to turn out right in the end . i would advise you to not waste your time on the '60s and do something else with your time . i 'm glad i watched this in class , and not on my own time . i think i can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of bob dylan 's music . those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick . i hope you take my advice , and stay away from this .
this movie is awful ! i do n't even know where to begin , i 'm speechless i ca n't even describe how awful this is . the blood is flourescent first of all , and the acting is awful ! the only good part was the biker chick that saves the day . this movie was rediculous , i do n't see how it could even get a vote of 1 its so bad . it looks like it was made by highschool students .
if you have seen the sholay of 1975 , do n't watch this movie . if you have not seen the sholay of 1975 , go watch it . but do not watch this movie . this movie has all the ingredients that could possibly have gone wrong with making a remake of sholay . amitabh 'babban ' bachchan plays the role of a psycho villain to the best ( probably the only 40 mins of the reel that should n't be burnt ) . if you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with his character , it would still be worth a watch . but as insp . narsimha , mohanlal does n't do justice to his talent . ajay devgan ( heero ) is extremely mundane and the only reason i think , they cast prashant raj in the role of raj is because he has a striking resemblance to amitabh of his young days . sushmita sen carries herself well , with grace and make-up . but the award for the `` worst performance and any role till date '' must go to nisha kothari . she manages to degrade her acting to such levels that even high-school drama would would outshine her performance . if you have a mortal enemy , take him to this movie . : )
pretty bad movie offers nothing new . the usual creaks and moans attempt to make-up for a muddled , but thin story . acting is barely above pathetic . why liam neeson signed on for this is anyone 's guess . owen wilson truly turns in one of the worst performances in recent horror-movie history . catherine zeta jones is fun to look at and not much else although lili tayor did an above-average job . the special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous . however they ca n't makeup for the poor acting and the storyline which appears to have been thrown together at the last minute . do n't bother .
in spite of the great future-design touches , the clever asimov premise , and will smith 's dependable cool performance , this movie does n't live up to expectations . the clichés come thick and fast ; ( waking from a recurring nightmare , maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant , to list more would be spoiling it - you can see the end a mile off ) . this movie is also stagebound - you never feel that you have travelled anywhere ; what 's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago . the robots themselves are good in closeup , but the 'crowd ' scenes look more like bad disney -the cgi is overdone again and again . and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them , why do they need to inject 'nanites ' ? you know it 's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax . it could have been great , but it 's less than the sum of its parts , mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years .
i rented this movie on dvd . i knew that the movie would n't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case , but once i saw that leatherface ( gunnar hansen ) was in it , i had to rent it . it starts off pretty good , with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable . however , the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever , and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging . there are way too many unanswered questions . there was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise , but overall this is a very sub par movie , but i guess it was worth the $ 3.99 rental fee .
this must be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen , the graphics are ridiculous , and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection process . i like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie , so i ca n't say i 'm picky . i have been struggling to find something to compare it to , but i just ca n't think of anything that matches this , maybe starship troopers 2 . witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my dvd player , but compared to this its effects are great . the acting superb and the script should be awarded . you know when a movie is bad in a funny way , well folks this is n't one of those this kills your soul minute by minute .
mt little sister and i are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs . we have seen just about everything , especially zombie flicks . now , we have seen a lot of good zombie movies , and a lot of bad ones . this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life . not only was the acting horrible , but the special effects , graphics and ever `` zombie '' make-up was the worst i have seen . if you can even call it make-up ( black eye shadow around the eyes ) this is totally proof that you should never judge a book by it 's cover . cause the cover to the movie is the only sweet thing about . do your selves a favor and do not watch this movie ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i was so adamant about this movie i went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying `` this movie sucks , do n't waste your time , return now '' hahahhaa i do n't want anyone else to waste a good movie night on this pos movie ! i do n't even know how it got the ratings that it did , t should be in the negative
from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb , this movie seems to get ragged on a lot , but i did n't think it was that bad . i 've seen much worse , actually . `` the house where evil dwells '' is a ghost story about a husband and his wife , ted and laura fletcher , and their daughter , amy , who move into an old house in japan . little do they know , a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover , and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword . as strange things happen in the house , the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living , and plan on re-enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back . i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance , from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story . it was routine , and it was corny , but i 've seen worse in my day . the ghost sequences were a little over-done , we get to see the translucent blue-tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family , and take over their bodies . to be honest , the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland . i may be mistaken , but after watching this , it seemed to me that the japanese horror film `` ju-on : the grudge '' and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little . the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place , ghostly activity , curses put on the home , etc . but i may be wrong . to sum it up , this is a pretty corny ghost story . do n't go out of your way to see it , but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot . 4/10 .
here 's the good news first . `` spirit '' is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release . the artwork and effects are revolutionary , and i recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone . and now for the bad news . i really mean it when i say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it . you may remember that `` spirit '' got badly trounced by `` lilo and stitch '' last summer . the first person who argues that it was because disney is more well-established and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled `` why 'lilo and stitch '' s script did n't stink '' . for all the incredible new animation technology on display in `` spirit '' , the story is almost * astonishingly * dull . there is a lesson here , and ( needless to say ) it does n't just apply to animated movies . you can have the most mind-blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal , but if your story is boring and , more importantly , we do n't care about your characters , it 's bad film-making . simple as that . the animation is still mind-blowing ; i just ca n't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it .
discovery channel/animal planet must be ashamed of themselves . this fantasy is modeled after the `` walking with dinosuars '' series . even though this is 100 % fantasy it is presented in the same factual and archaeological way . even mixing the fantasy dragons with t-rexs and the extinction of the dinos . added to being shown on an educational channel instead of say sci-fi it gives an air of factual authenticity to this show . on its own the show is about an 7.5/10 far as entertainment goes . but the way in which it is presented i have to give it a 1/10 . do n't get me wrong i have no problem with fantasy but they way they put this out is so wrong . i can really see young kids and slow adults believing that they did find a dragon and that this is real . i also think this weakens the great `` walking with dinosuars '' series because now you have to view that with a mind of how much is fantasy on that mini-series .
oh dear , what a horrid movie . the production was so cheap and nasty ... remember the shot from `` the natural '' , where the lightning hits the tree ( leaving a glowing stump ) that roy hobbs makes a bat from ? ? well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house . i wonder if they paid to use the footage from the natural , or did they just hope that no-one who would watch the film would pick it up ? then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck . such over-acting in the cabin . a really bad film , a really bad film .
no , i 've never seen any of the `` santa slasher '' series , i.e . 'silent night , deadly night , ' the original 'black christmas ' or this one , 'christmas evil . ' i 've heard all about their reputation , or , mads ( mothers against deranged santas . ) i thought i would rent this one as i 've heard it pop up as a reference on a 'fat guys at the movies ' segment . mothers should be against this , but not for the ooooohhhh `` killer '' santa , but for the fact this movie was just plain crap . boring , long  even at only 92 minutes , crap . little boy sees santa arrive down a chimney in 1947 , deliver presents , eat some goodies and miraculously , float up the chimney . boy goes to bed , but returns to living room to witness mommy and santa ( sort of ) getting it on . apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life , though the scene was about as steamy as when ralphie 's dad got the `` leg lamp '' in ' a christmas story . ' he was sooo disturbed , he went to the attic and , well cut his own hand . fast forward to the future ! now , it 's 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory . we get a whiff of him being a little off-kilter , and he stalks both kids and parents alike . who 's naughty , who 's nice , blah blah . it takes a good two-thirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if that 's not foreshadowed from frame one . no movie should take that long . i will admit , this movie had its tension building , but only because i kept expecting him to do something , anything to anyone . when he finally does , well , punish `` who 's naughty , '' it 's as graphic as a `` garbage pail kid '' card . and i have n't mentioned the wtf ending . i 'm thinking it was a metaphor , but in reality , it 's just as weird as the rest of the movie . ( take the brother who 's upset his sibling is killing , and his solution is uh , killing . ) do n't open this mess , even on christmas eve , or evil . again , i did n't watch the other `` santa-slashers '' but this one sucked bad . it built up suspense due to the nature of the movie and never once delivered a decent present .
wendy wu : homecoming warrior has a very good , strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie . i am a younger teenager and did n't enjoy this movie very much . i thought the effects were horrible , but they might seem entertaining to younger children . the matrix moves ruined the action , you know that it was absolutely fake . then there was the yen lo , an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which wendy was striving to win . it all ends like a typical feel good movie when wendy and her buddhist monk cousin shen defeat yen lo ( and destroy him forever ) in the end . so wendy learns a lesson ... blah , blah , blah . i 'm ready for the next dcom .
kudos to the patience of paul muni , who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of zola . muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and i wonder how many people today -other than classic movie buffs - know anything about it . he was a giant in the business for at least a decade . he could have won the academy award for this performance , which would have given him two in a row , as he won it for playing louis pasteur the year before . my own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit , i still think he was one of the great actors of the `` golden age . '' whatever part he played ; you were riveted to the screen watching him . unlike the pasteur role , i thought this story smacked of a little too much of what we 've seen in the last 60 years : going overboard to make a liberal hero . even in 1937 , hollywood could n't suppress its disdain for police or for the military , here making it a point to tell us how `` corrupt '' those organizations are . filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated . in that regard , this film is way ahead of its day since we 've seen this big-time since the 1960s . however , it must be noted the facts support this story . it also does not in any way diminish zola 's accomplishments as a social reformer , getting rid of certain evils . good for him ! i wish they had spent more time showing that , than concentrating on one trial .
i really must have caught a different film from the rest of the commentators on this site because at a screening of the film last night the audience was so mortified by the dialoge that ( i 'm not even kidding ) half walked out . shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual coming-of-age story , the film utilizes david lynch inspired visuals with fassbinder inspired acting . the performances in this film are so dull and bored that i figured one of the actors was going to pass out by how uninspired they seemed to be by the script . what 's worse is that it 's colored like an episode of miami vice . i do n't know who this director thinks he is ; maybe he has pretensions of the surreal like bunuel , jordowsky , etc . but the problem is that all of the afore mentioned directors display a level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here . i could understand the meaningfulness of this film about ten years ago , but when we 've got masterpieces such as bad eduction , mysterious skin and show me love why bother with this cinematic turd ? there is nothing new to be seen here .
this movie is another one on my list of movies not to bother with . saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent , stayed up late to do so , was very annoyed to find that it was about 95 % romance,4 % everything else , 1 % history if that . it 's what i call a bait and switch movie , one with an interesting title , the actual movie is a scam . this is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment , this movie is almost an insult to those who served . the actual members of the lafayette escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes , they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help france . and i suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than tab hunter 's character . flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls , an individual such as the one portrayed here would n't have lasted two days , it would have either been the stockade or the infantry . discipline in the french army was often rather fierce . in short , another hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment .
i ca n't recommend this film as a date movie . gary oldman 's semi-autobiographical account of life lived on a south east london estate is a violent , beckettian account of one of dante 's circles of hell , frankly . at the centre of it is ray winstone , who has done this sort of character before but never as well . the film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar - that 's all - and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration , self-loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie . it 's an acting masterclass . of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and winstone is matched by kathy burke as his long-suffering wife , who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour . charlie creed-miles does an able turn as the fuse-lighting druggie son billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for . gary oldman directs close up on the actors , maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor . 4/10
just saw the movie this past weekend , i am upset , and disappointed with it . basically , the movie tells you that immigrants , the ones from former soviet union especially , come to this country , bring everyone they can with them from the old country , and invade and take over what americans have been working for . which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration , and a much worse way of telling people about it . that 's the main thing . another thing , the overall writing , directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs . the actors did pretty well , but it was n't up to them save this bunch of crap . a few jokes were funny , but most were bad and cheesy . could n't wait to get out of the theater , want my money back .
for some strange reason the film world is driven by fashion . someone makes a film about a killer shark then all of a sudden the film world ` s oceans are awash with giant squids , killer octopusses and sea monsters of every ilk . a man is stalked by an erstwhile lover from hell then every film character is stalked by a cop from hell or a flatmate from hell or a babysitter from hell . then when a major hollywood company produces a big budget fx laden blockbuster about tornados then other film producers jump upon the bandwagon , the fact that they don ` t have the budget to pull it off doesn ` t stop them . night of the twisters is a case in point . what struck me about this made for television film is the fact that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting to the ad breaks . everytime a tornado appears the camara locks onto the horrified expression of the actors as they scream things like `` oh my gawd it ` s heading this way `` and `` run for your lives `` then the screen fades to black saving the producers the need to up the special effects budget . unfortunately night of the twisters budget should have been upped to include better actors . the cast are by no means bad but they are unimpressive and lack the skill to carry a film which is character driven . where ` s josh hartnett and elijah wood when you need them ? and the last word on this being a twister clone ..... yes nott was released a couple of months before twister but twister had been hyped for several months as being the summer blockbuster of 1996 and nott has a rushed feeling to it which leads me to believe that it was made and released to tie in with the hype surrounding twister
first of all , i 'd like to tell you that i 'm into comics , anime , animation and such stuff . it is true that everyone has his own preferences , but you can trust me on this movie . i 'll be objective . to begin with the story - it 's ok . follows the story line of the comic books as far as i 'm familiar with them . but the animation ... well , it 's not actually terrible , but it 's definitely cheap and mediocre . it would be a lot better if they did n't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings . if we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more . looks a little bit like the original vampire hunter d from 1985 . take a look at heavy metal fakk 2000 for instance - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better ! in addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable , the music is nothing special . so all in all - it lacks atmosphere . i watched it , but i can not tell i really enjoyed it . it just does not capture you . there 's plenty of blood and violence , but that does not impress me at all . may be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time ( is there anyone around ? ) , but i do n't think this is the audience for this movie . so they could add a little nudity and spice to it . the chicks around lucifer were quite tasty , and hell , we have lady death herself ! there are few sexy looks , but that 's not enough . instead of bill brown 's music i think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack . all in all - the movie is n't that bad , but if you want something better take the original heavy metal , heavy metal fakk 2000 , ralph bakshi 's fire and ice or wizards maybe . and of course - vampire hunter d : bloodlust
fot the most part , this movie feels like a `` made-for-tv '' effort . the direction is ham-fisted , the acting ( with the exception of fred gwynne ) is overwrought and soapy . denise crosby , particularly , delivers her lines like she 's cold reading them off a cue card . only one thing makes this film worth watching , and that is once gage comes back from the `` semetary . '' there is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone , and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason . it is absolutely bone-chilling . this film only does one thing right , but it knocks that one thing right out of the park . worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so .
this movie is one reason imdb should allow a vote of 0/10 . the acting is awful , even what some here have lauded , the carpathia character ! the script looks like it was written in haste . in one scene , the black preacher who was left behind , when asked by buck what `` dan7 '' in the computer graphic meant , said , `` daniel 7 , * chapter * 24 . '' he probably meant verse 24 , but the film makers missed this slip up . perhaps the worst part is that the film 's eschatological position is biblically unsound . while many christians have espoused the film 's interpretation of end-time events , such interpretation , in * my opinion * , is faulty . to understand these flaws , read `` christians will go through the tribulation '' by jim mckeever and `` the blessed hope , a biblical study of the second advent and the rapture '' by george e. ladd .
if this documentary had not been made by the famous french director , louis malle , i probably would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes , as it was an incredibly dull look at a very ordinary midwestern american town in 1979 . this is not exactly my idea of a fun topic and the film footage closely resembled a collection of home movies . considering i did n't know any of these people , it was even less interesting . because it was a rather dull slice of life style documentary , i wondered while watching what was the message they were trying to convey ? perhaps it was that values are n't as conservative as you might think -- this was an underlying message through many of the vignettes ( such as the republicans whose son was a draft resister as well as the man and lady who thought sex outside of marriage was just fine ) . or , perhaps the meaning was that there was a lot of bigotry underlying the nice home town -- as several ugly ideas such as blaming jews for financial conspiracies , anti-black bigotry and homophobia all were briefly explored . the small town of 1979 was explored in great depth and an idyllic sort of world was portrayed , but when the film makers returned six years later , the mood was depressed thanks to president reagan . this seemed very disingenuous for several reasons . first , the 1979 portion was almost 90 % of the film and the final 10 % only consisted of a few interviews of people that blamed the president for just about everything but acne . what about the rest of the folks of this town ? did they all see reagan as evil or that their lives had become more negative ? with only a few updates , it seemed suspicious . second , while it is true that the national debt doubled in the intervening years , so did the gross national product . and , while malle shows 1979 as a very optimistic period , it was far from that , as the period from 1974-1980 featured many shortages ( gas , sugar , etc . ) , strikes , high inflation and general malaise . while i am not a huge fan of reagan because government growth did not slow during his administration , the country , in general , was far more optimistic than it had been in the ford and carter years . while many in the media demonized reagan ( a popular sport in the 80s ) , the economy improved significantly and the documentary seems very one-sided and agenda driven . had the documentary given a more thorough coverage of 1985 and had n't seemed too negative to be believed ( after all , everyone did n't have their lives get worse -- this defies common sense ) , then i might have thought otherwise . overall , not the wonderful documentary some have proclaimed it to be -- ranging from a dull film in 1979 to an extremely slanted look at 1985 . by the way , is it just me , or does the film drop dead gorgeous seem to have been inspired , at least in part , by this film ? both are set in similar communities , but the latter film was a hilarious mockumentary without all the serious undertones .
i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this . but they tried to do too much . why they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me . i do n't want to knock burt or adam for the way they look now ..... it 's been 35 years since they appeared at batman and robin , but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys ' was kinda sad . i would rather of just seen the ex-stars do commentary . the batmobile side story was stupid . as for the flashback movie , i think it was too short and left out way too much . it was really just a quick overview in my opinion . i 'd like more background . they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew . the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex-smoker . that was it on those 2 . i 'd love to read the book . i am sure it has more in it that this showed . like why was there 2 riddlers or why 3 catwoman 's or 3 mister freezes . where was commishioner gordon , cheif ohara , alfred , mister freeze , king tut , etc . the list goes on . like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it . very disappointing . and really corny .
a few months ago , i was involved in a debate with another imdb poster ( hey , kmadden ) about this film . the poster insisted that if i gave 'flushed away ' a chance , i would like it . based partially on that argument , i agreed to watch the film . 'flushed away ' has good intentions ( at least on aardman 's part ) , but lacks the strength to pull it all together . its best asset is sewer rat/boat captain , rita ( played by kate winselt ) , who , imo , should have been the movie 's main character instead of roddy ( hugh jackman ) . rita 's cool , tough , and interesting , while roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling . one of the things that bothered me most about 'fa ' is the repetition of jokes that are n't funny to begin with . when roddy gets hit in the crouch , the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately . `` my name 's shocky , '' says one of rita 's brothers , who then electrocutes roddy at least three times . my tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low . i wo n't waste time griping about katzenberg 's kleptomaniac tendencies toward pixar ( one similar film 's a coincidence , five 's a rip off . ) , but i will say i 'm disappointed in aardman . they can do ( and have done ) so much better . try harder next time , guys .
happened upon a copy of this . not mine and if i had spent my own money on this i 'd be finding those responsible and demanding it back ! all i can say is this would be a terrible student film . any understanding of the medium of film is absent . acting is god awful , the story would have been rejected from the original twilight zone series as unoriginal and lame , and the change in tone of the lead character 's reaction to the 'ghost ' is laughable . i can only agree that the 'glowing ' reviews of this film are from friends and family . i 'm afraid it 's not even entertainingly bad . amateur in the extreme ! avoid ! avoid ! avoid !
four best friends young male chauvinist pigs ( with the emphasis on pigs ) meet weekly at a nyc diner to recount their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy . peet is the common denominator who dates the three bachelors in the group which leads to conflict and the inevitable `` whipping '' . although the film 's premise has potential and there are some funny moments to be had , overall the flick does n't work especially in the end where the girls are made to appear no better than the guys which runs contrary to the crux of the story . one of those one-man band flix with a dozen producers , `` whipped '' is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young males who think `` the man show '' is emmy material .
can a-pix ever , ever , ever do anything right ? this movie was meant to be seen on tv in a letterbox format . since a-pix does n't even believe in pan and scan , we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side . of course , not that you are missing much . this movie is incredibly bad . it 's very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80 % of the movie for no reason .
this book-based movie is truly awful , and a big disappointment . we 've been waiting for this move over a month . many film reviewer were hopeful for it . also in newspapers and tv , it made big sense . when 29th april comes , many people regretfully noticed that movie is really awful . why ? first of all story was so monotone . it has been many indefinite scenes , sometimes it 's hard to realize what 's going on . the actresses , out of hulya avsar , were n't harmonized with their roles , especially vildan atasever . she acts better in comedy films , in this movie , a kind of drama , she could n't disposed of her previous role . and finally movie is too short , just 66 minutes .
the previous poster obviously worked on the movie . it 's a joke how bad it is and no one would review this kind of movie the way he did.mentioning all of the actors ' names and what they were in previously is a sure sign that he 's involved with it in some way . it 's on cinemax right now and i was sure this was some movie where porn stars ( the one called ava is gorgeous and well-endowed ) were forced to make something else for some crazy tax reason . also , when i first saw it , i was sure it was made in about 1986 , and i was born in '73 , so i thought i knew what i was talking about ... but no ... it was made in 1993 ! ! unbelievable ! though i would call it one of those so bad it 's good movies . like watching a train wreck .
lame , cliched superhero action movie drivel . i had high hopes for this movie , and the genre of hk buddy cop actioneers is one that i do n't despise , but very rarely do i see a storyline as trite and ludicrous as this one was . this would have been forgivable , as it always is in these kinds of movies , when the action compensates , unfortunately , it did not . the action does carry the trademark surreality and over the top nature of hk action , but it 's not very involving , obscenely gory , and in fact often completely incoherent ( perhaps this is due to re-editing for american release , it does show signs in many places of patchwork ) . i was very disappointed .
twin brothers separated at birth ( due to the deaths of their parents ) reunite twenty five years later to avenge their parents and take back their million dollar tunnel . double impact runs at two hours long and basically adds no real approach to the corsican brothers plot and jean-claude van damme while adequate as the evil twin brother is just embarrassing as the good twin brother . also the action sequences are n't as exciting this time and jean-claude relies more on gunfire then on his martial arts . also the supporting cast is wasted and at two hours the movie is just plain dull . * out of 4 ( bad )
this is a made-for-tv and rather needless sci-fi channel retelling of the beowulf story , especially after the recent 2005 film `` beowulf and grendel '' . this movie does n't really get into beowulf 's story , but just takes us through his battle against the ravenous beast known as grendel as it leaves a kingdom in absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful viking warrior , beowulf is called upon to rid them of the monster 's rampage . if this is successfully accomplished , the king will no longer have to sacrifice the children to keep it at bay . after a few failed attempts , the creature is slain , but it 's angry and vengeful mother soon attacks , leaving it up to beowulf to , again , lend his mighty acts of bravery and strength to defeat it . `` grendel '' looks like it was shot on a tiny budget and the cg effects are terrible . like i said , this movie is absolutely needless .
this is a truly abysmal ` lock stock ' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script . i have no idea why so many top british actors signed up to this junk , they must have been bribed . a miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if i had n't have paid good money for it i 'd have turned it off after 10 minutes . not the worst film ive ever seen , that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie ' ( i use the term loosely ) ` gummo ' ( i feel like suing that so called ` director ' for the lost hour and a half of my life ) but this trash is nearly right down there with it . definitely one of the worst 5 films i have ever seen . stuff like this reminds hollywood that they do n't have a monopoly on truly awful films .
i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted , remembering rahs and raves for it . but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary , it backed off and went somewhere else . the dripping water throughout the house , the black rain , the prophetic dreams , taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream . what a disappointment . chamberlain 's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief , something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on . what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one 's head . the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods , that the aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests , and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension ( the dream time ) . [ spoiler ] in the final scene , it was n't clear to me what the director was trying to tell . is there a big wave ? so what ? how big ? a tsunami ? yeah , okay . that 's devastating but not apocalyptic . is it the end of the world ? from a wave ? the last wave ? that 'd have to be a pretty darn big wave . why ? was the world that bad a place ? it did n't seem so awful in this movie . actually i did n't think the wave came off , since the shadow left burton 's face that had been cast by the wave . was it only burton 's apocalypse ? heck , that happens every day to people who lose it . it was n't of any interest if it was only him . the most frightening scene , and the one that gives the best indication of weir 's potential , was in charlie 's apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burton 's wife . charlie keeps asking him `` who are you ? '' and it becomes truly disturbing after a while . unfortunately , the movie never followed suit .
this is just a joke of a movie , they lost me already at the opening scene ( spoilerwarning ) dangerous creature kills other creature in his cage , this is watched by a scientist that works there on a monitor and guess what she does , well lets go in to the cage to check the stuff out , omg how dumb do those writers think human beings are come on thats the same like jumping in a fish tank with a great white shark because it ate your goldfish ... pretty useless and even more dumber.and i will not even talk about the cast because they are n't worth the effort . why they did n't fired the guy that wrote that immediately is a mystery to me ..... and this kinda dumbness continues the entire movie . only good thing where the cgi that is better then average for these kinda low-budget movies . if these kinda things do n't bother you go see it , but be warned if your iq is above 60 you will probably hate it .
this movie is terrible . carlitos way ( 1993 ) is a great film . goodgfellas it is n't but its one of the better crime films done . this movie should be considered closer to the sting part2 or maybe speed zone . remember those gems ! the only reason this movie was made was to capitalize on the cult following of the original . this movie lacked everything de palma , pacino and penn worked so hard on . there was n't a likable character and that is the fault of everyone responsible for making it . i hope rise to power wins every razzie it possibly can and maybe even invent some new categories to allow it be a record holder . after i watched this s @ * t fest movie , i sat down and watched the original carlitos way to get th bad taste out of my mouth . after watching this i wish pachanga came and whacked me out of my misery .
here we have 2 misunderstood kids who never stood a chance against a cruel , poverty riddled existence : robin hoods singled out by the police for persecution because they were a trifle wild at times . gad ! according to this crap bonnie was the sweetest little thing west of the missouri who was taught to be a psychopathic murderer by a fun loving boyfriend who did n't really want to hurt anybody .... he just wanted things without putting a lot of energy into getting them . badly acted , poorly filmed , unbelievable dialogue , unrealistic use of weaponry , gore that looked more like grape jelly than the real thing . avoid this bilgewater . thumbs down . -5 stars .
in sixth grade , every teacher i had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester . every class had something to do with this terrible show . we watched it in english and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters . in math we talked about charts and other sea crap . in science we talked about whales ( which was actually somewhat interesting , so this was n't a 100 % waste of time ) . all day everyday was torture . not only that , but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well . i could see if this was a new series or something , but it was , like , '93 . i 'm still trying to block this out .
sweet sixteen ( 1983 ) * * / * * * * * 86 minutes director jim sotos cast bo hopkins , susan strasberg , aleisa shirley , patrick macnee , dana kimmell fifteen year old bad girl melissa is new in a desert town and it is n't long before folks around her start dying off . the detective has to put together the clues with the help of his nancy drew good girl daughter played by friday the 13th alumni dana kimmell . the local native americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk . these events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at melissa 's sixteenth birthday party . this below average slasher is n't too memorable . it has a made for tv feel , without much score besides the title character 's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout . lines like `` the killer will turn us into coleslaw . '' fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays . marci calls melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship . apparently marci sees how hard it is to fit in because melissa knows how to wear make-up . this movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her . the social commentary on indians was n't developed enough to be taken seriously . i am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets . both sweet sixteen and ed hunt 's bloody birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but i feel failed to deliver . but on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on dvd gives hope that others will follow .
brides are dying at the altar , and their corpses are disappearing . everybody is concerned , but nobody seems to be able to figure out why and how this is happening , nor can they prevent it from happening . bear with me . bela lugosi is responsible for this , as he is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his ancient wife and keep her alive . continue to bear with me . finally , the authorities figure out that somebody must be engineering the deaths and disappearances , but of course , they ca n't figure out the improbable motive . let 's just ignore the ludicrous pseudoscience and move on ... if you can get through the first twenty minutes of this mess , you will be treated to lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he has murdered , explaining that he finds sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed , and other vague parodies of real horror films ( the kind with budgets and plots ) . anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit ( and remarkably the inept police are nowhere to be seen ! ) , and then the fun really starts . the cinematography and acting are ok . there are a lot of well dressed , very good looking people in this film . the directing is fair , and the script is a little better than the material deserved . nevertheless , this film fails to sustain the interest of all but the most hardened b-film fan . the best thing about it .... it does eventually end , but not soon enough .
just kidding ! this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen ! it was so bad though , that it was hilarious . my friend and i purposly rented it because it looked so bad . cheesy old horror flicks are always good for some laughs . the plot stunk , some of the voices were dubbed , the quality was horrendous . but i sure had a blast watching it !
i watch lots of bad films , lots ! ! ! ! ! ! it 's kind of a hobby , really . almost every saturday nite a group of friends and i get together and watch trash from around the globe - anything . turkish super hero movies , vampire flicks from brazil , italian gorilla transplant movies , kevin costner films , anything ( except maybe raising helen ) but ihave never seen a worst film than theodore rex . never . and it 's not even entertainingly bad in an ed wood kinda way - it just sucks . now this film was famous in hollywood at the time it was made because whoopi took off the gloves and made it clear to the press and anyone else who would listen that she hated this piece of crap = she tried to get out of her contract , she whined , she moaned but nonetheless they pour her fat butt into this leather skin tight futuristic cop uniform that is ghastly to see , yikes ! ! ! ! and you can just see her seething during takes - doing everything but looking off camera for her agent so she can scream at him . the dinosaur has about three facial expressions and the script is so horrible a third grade class could do a better job if promised cookies .
if you want to watch a real 'quality ' movie get hold of the eden formula . this wondrous film must have cost all of $ 50 to make . it features a wafer thin script , pathetically bad sets , lighting and camera work , and a stop motion , paper-mache monster that is utterly laughable ( it looks like they sometimes used a guy in a rubber suit and/or a glove puppet for the monster - but all were equally dreadful ) . the actors all speak their lines as though they 've never seen them before and are reading off a teleprompter . the special effects are way beyond lousy . and the only sad thing is that they dropped the really nifty original title 'tyranasaurus wrecks ' which sums up exactly what you get for the full 90 minutes . this is what happens when you scrape the bottom of the barrel so hard you break through to the crud that lies underneath . i loved every minute of it .
poor acting , no script , no plot , no convincing killer , no suspense , no original setups , it uses the same closet/under the bed/person-behind-you-in-the-mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring , and not in a foreshadowing way either , and the fact that nobody ever `` really '' gets killed ( at least not on screen ) , which in turn zaps any suspense it may invoke right out of it and makes everyone feel eve more cheated for spending money on their admission ticket .... its a horror film w/o any horror lmao . the most you see is what looks like someone having taken a ketchup bottle and spraying it across a plastic sheet . you have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this , or you were high/drunk at the time . honestly , i have a life and do n't bother writing reviews that often unless i really really hated something , or enjoyed it tremendously . but this film is awful and i feel i have a duty of sorts to warn you not to give your money to hollywood and encourage this kind of filmaking ever again ! it is one thing to rent a `` bad '' movie at blockbuster from the weinsteins , its another when you have to sit through it in a theater . also , in case you want some remake nostalgia , forget it ! this is not a remake , nor is it a re-imagining . it is not scary , nor engaging , nor is it satisfying enough to be `` funny '' like others on imdb have claimed ... it is just stale and booooring . here is what you will take away from this film : remembering the scar on brittany snow 's head that stands out more than the plot , the fact that jonathan schaech must be having some sexual affair with j.s . cardone of `` the forsaken '' to have gotten another role as a killer ( because he is as frightening as my poodle , and too cute to kill just about anyone ) and that for some reason ( duh ) everyone who goes back to the hotel suite never comes back . what kind of person would not get worried at the prom when they decide to announce the candidates for prom king and queen and the fiercely competitive girl just somehow does n't show up ? this is my warning to you . do not waste you 're money like i did . the `` original '' sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for jamie lee curtis fans , though no way near as bad as this piece of crap ( sorry to sound vulgar or rude , but once you see this , you will understand why i say what i say ) .
what an absolute pile of pants . having read chris brookmyre 's books religiously since i came across `` quite ugly ... '' , i was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned . i obviously had too much faith . nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he does n't quite fit . how anyone can read the book , and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me . entire characters are changed , situations are dropped , and to see parlablane 's dramatic break-in reduced to nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window ... it brought tears to my eyes . i dread to think what 's going to happen with `` country of the blind '' if this is the benchmark ... please , just avoid it ...
i guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music ? is the cartoonish acting of howard desilva meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children ? is william daniels ' campy contemporary ( for the time ) acting style meant to appeal to a 1960s/70s demographic ? do we need all the `` in-jokes '' about ny & nj ? ( i can hear the blue-haired broadway audience guffawing on cue . ) sorry , i find the whole piece dated , boring & the acting far too strident for the screen
a dog found in a local kennel is mated with satan and has a litter of puppies , one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit & run . the puppy wants no time in making like donald trump and firing the mexican housekeeper , how festive . only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears , the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch . so it 's up to dad to say the day . this late 70 's made for tv horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia . when i saw this as a kid i found it to be a tense nail-biter , but revisiting it as an adult i now realize that it 's merely lame , boring , and not really well-acted in the least bit . my grade : d
this film is the worst film i have ever seen . the story line is weak - i could n't even follow it . the acting is high-schoolish . the sound track is irritating . the attempts at humor are not . the editing is horrible . the credits are even slow - i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of film . do n't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting .
this film tries to be immensely clever , and tarantino-like before you try that though , you need solid filmic fundamentals . these include good sound , editing , set design etc ... lets talk about the sound in this movie . absolutely atrocious . i have never been more distracted by a sound track , ever and before we talk about low budget , film made in chile etc .. lets bear in mind that desent sound these days is far more achievable than it ever has been . anywhere . and more info on technique is available then ever before the sound in this movie is plain bad . the foley in particular is out of place and inappropriate throughout , the atmos is equally terrible . i heard at least four loud clicks during the movie , which are the result of poor sound editing . the sound inside cars is awful , the sound of car doors closing is awful . the sound of the lady singing is wrong . foley is either overboard , or simply not there like the sound person just got bored and gave up . the spaces are wrong . everything about it is wrong and yet , not letting limitations of creativity get in the way , at the same time the movie tries boldly to be clever . for example the sound of the aquarium is used in the following street scene . we hear sound when we 're not supposed to . sound edits precede visual cuts . every trick in the book is used , and yet the foundations are just not there editing-wise we have scenes using heavy jump cuts , we have tinkering around with the time line etc etc etc , yawn . all of these techniques are imitated to a splendidly low standard overall the mix is crap , the sound is crap . and so , the film is crap . how can a movie with so many fundamental flaws be considered for awards and high praise ? chile 's cinematic new wave ? the best creative output that chile has to offer ? i hope not , and i think not . my theory is that chile 's more selective and better talent avoided this film like the plague maybe due to its risqué content . equally , the film has likely received so much unwarranted critical acclaim from so called 'world-cinema ' enthusiasts for the same grubby reasons . they likely revel in it 's trashiness . of course film critics rarely pay attention to technical details and quality this film is rubbish . it 's all mouth and no trousers and is never deserving of a 6.8 rating . the film has all the production quality of a cheap tarantino , new wave inspired porno !
the plot , character development , and gags in this movie are all extremely weak . quite a waste of time . the conclusion of saving grace is supposed to make one feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggles . there was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible . the drug gags are cliched and much of the movie does n't ring true to life . the plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters are n't developed enough to care . then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like they have just wasted their time .
but thomas ian griffith just does n't have the polish that a big bucks actor has , granted this was made 5+ years ago . some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action , but comedy . and how do you get kc out of katia koslovska anyhow ? plummer 's character was so corny , he would have fit better in a bullwinkle toon . personally , if action flicks are going to show skin -- i 'd have liked to have seen equal time between female/male , otherwise do n't show any .
exceptionally horrible tale that i can barely put into words . the best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end , alive and well , only to be massacred again . there is the chance that i missed some crucial plot elements since i may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on . the box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film . i was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'euro-trash , sexy horror flick . ' i get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out . all the good stuff more than likely . i got the pg-13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'planet of the apes ' movie . watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff . you 'll need it .
yeah , i `` get '' pasolini and his milieu , but at the same time , i feel his `` decameron '' is largely overrated , and more than a little disturbing . overrated because the supposed `` realism '' he introduces ( milling crowds , crumbling architecture , etc . ) are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave . in the pursuit of realism , pasolini utilized many non-actors , but their deer-in-the-headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off-kilter and inconsistent feel . and frankly -- many of the toothless , misshapenly-featured people are painful to look at . and pasolini 's `` decameron '' is disturbing ( to me at least ) because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content . not because i 'm prudish or homophobic ( i 'm neither ) but because the emphasis that pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo-realism he otherwise espouses , so it comes off as gratuitous and forced . one can almost hear him say `` ooh -- i 've got to stick a cute , naked boy in this scene ! '' at times it seems that pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics , and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself , regardless of what his audience might prefer . the disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in pasolini 's `` decameron '' struck me as being a failing of pasolini as a storyteller , rather than being an aspect of neo-realism . he seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction . even the pasolini 's final line of dialog in the film , which some people seem to find pithy ( `` why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter ? '' ) -- to me , it just makes me wonder why pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way ? in my opinion , a far better-crafted film ( and with more homosexual content ) is fellini 's `` satyricon '' . it is also full of bizarre-looking people and absurd situations , but it succeeds because of its pacing , direction and strong storytelling whereas `` decameron '' fails by those same elements .
the fallen ones starts with archaeologist matt fletcher ( casper van dien ) in the desert discovering the mummified remains of a 42 foot tall giant , now there 's something you do n't see everyday . matt is working for property developer morton ( robert wagner ) who wants to build a holiday resort on the land & he calls in fellow archaeologist angela ( kristen miller ) for reasons i 'm unsure of . anyway they both try to figure out what they 've got on they 're hands when some of the team go missing , morton calls in security guy ammon ( navid negahban ) to handle the situation . meanwhile ancient text translator the rabbi eli schmidtt ( tom bosley ) translates some ancient text ( as he would ) & is shocked to learn of a evil prophecy in which these giants will rise up & take over the world for the fallen one , or something like that . it 's up to matt to save the day & the whole planet ... written & directed by kevin vanhook , who also has a small role in the film as the ancient warrior leader at the start , i personally thought the fallen ones was a terrible film & it 's as simple & straight forward as that . there are so many things that are just plain bad about the fallen ones both on a technical & conceptual level , the script does n't make a whole lot of sense & it does n't really get going until the final 20 odd minutes by which time i had almost lost the will to live . the character 's are awful & as clichéd as you like , the dialogue is bad as in very , very bad & the entire film is predictable , i mean it 's not going to come as a surprise that casper van dien is going to save the day is it ? it 's not a huge surprise that the mummified giant is going to come back to life either so why wait until over an hour into the film when most of the audience will be in some sort of comatose state . this is bad , very bad . you have been warned . director vanhook does n't impress , the fight scenes are absolutely awful & why dress your bad guys up in a horrible shade of purple ? they look naff . to give it a bit of credit the special effects on the giant mummy itself are actually good although there 's not that many of them since he does n't make an appearance for over an hour , there are also some normal sized mummy 's that look to have come straight from the set of the mummy ( 1999 ) , unfortunately these are n't used to any great effect & in fact are wasted as some comic relief . the mechanical mummy was a pretty good idea but looked silly & there is no way on earth that all those people inside could work in sync with each other to operate it , actually the more i think about the more ridiculous the idea is . forget about any scares , tension or atmosphere & do n't even think about any gore or violence because there is n't any . technically the fallen ones is n't anything special & apart from the impressive giant mummy effects there 's little her to get excited about . the ghost cgi & water effects are terrible , it was made-for-tv & it 's shows . the acting was poor , wagner looks embarrassed & this is probably the only thing the likes of dien & bosley can get these days . the fallen ones is a bad film , there 's no two ways about it as far as i 'm concerned . not recommended on any level or in any way , one to avoid .
ok , here it is : `` nazi mountaineer befriends the dalai lama . '' what we do is , first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a germanic accent , and we let him flounder around between french , german , american , and british for over 2 hours . then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely , so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly . but just to make sure the viewer doesn´t fall asleep , we throw in details which are shockingly absurd , such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22,000 feet . naturally , we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles , so we have every character , even the lowliest peasant in the forbidden closed-off city of lhasa in 1943 , speak perfect english , also with dubious accents . of course , the trickiest part is how to handle the spiritual and political aspects of the story , so what we do is this : we have the dalai lama befriend the now-reformed nazi because the latter is so good at fiddling with film projectors , radios , antique cars , and any other devices with represent the freedom of the capitalist west . in return , our hero learns from his young protegé a kind of vague , undefined buddhism which is never really brought out or treated in a serious fashion . we also have lots of scenes with the hero flaunting all the marks of respects and protocol which the rest of the tibetan society accords the dalai lama , even as we pretend that the hero has deep and profound reverence for these people and their spiritual leader . in other words , we just expect the audience to believe that this guy is now a buddhist , sort of , in his own way , even though we ourselves don´t seem to know what his transformation entails or how far we want it to go . and last but not least , we hang a statistic onto the end of the film about how appallingly the chinese have treated the tibetans ( which is certainly true ) , thus opening ourselves up to charges that we have made a `` political '' movie , even though it is nothing of the sort . so , zat ist my idea . vat do you zink ? can ve make zis movie ?
always enjoy great films which deal with the super-natural and the deep thoughts of the spiritual world . however , this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction . there is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell ; all i can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen . the actors , namely : mark addy , thomas garrett , gave an outstanding performance in his native land england , and we have seen him in `` still standing '' a tv series . heath ledger , played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in `` brokeback mountain '' , '05 , gave a great supporting role . shannyn sossaman , ( mara sinclair ) , did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith . do n't waste your time , you will be sorry !
attack of the killer tomatoes is a `` parody '' of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs . the ( very meager ) story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly . basically , they spin and growl ( yes , they growl ) and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup . the actors are no-names who never made movies after this , so there would be no point to name them . there 's a guy who 's hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes . he 's accompanied by a black guy who 's master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives . anyway , there 's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government . if this is n't making much sense to you , you understand . this movie never would have been very good in the first place , but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes . the movie is horribly cheezy , which although being the whole point , really really hurts what could 've been a ( reasonably ) entertaining movie . at one point , a giant wax tomato `` slides '' on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it ! maybe i would 've recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value , but even this is lacking from this terrible movie . 2/10
there is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent . nobody in it has ever tried acting before , even the extras in the coffee shop look as if they 've been glued in place . nothing looks rehearsed.the film quality is terrible . most of the 'action ' takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought , swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between 'actors ' as they deliver their lines . no tripod and no proper microphone either , there sound quality is terrible . even 'manos ' fares better than this , at least they had proper equipment . what plot there is simply gets lost in the production mess . stick to home videos , preferably made by some 5 year kid trying out the video feature on daddy 's new camera phone . you will be in for a long search to find a movie more inept than this .
a far as b-movies go , scarecrow is one of those that are so bad , that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through . a lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls , ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck . he then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him . apparently , the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers . this scarecrow , aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims , can also do matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight . also , why did he always look like a rotted corpse ? just like the two needless sequels that followed this , this is n't even worth a laugh .
first one was much better , i had enjoyed it a lot . this one has not even produced a smile . the idea was showing how deep down can human kind fall , but in reference to the characters not the film-maker .
the entire movie is flashbacks from the first boogeyman movie as well as , inexplicably , footage from another uli lommel / suzanna love film brainwaves . it is framed with some more current ( from the early 90 's anyway ) footage that is boring , poorly acted and cheaply shot . not only is the film almost completely flashbacks , they repeat the same flashbacks throughout the film . so you see the recycled footage over and over again , as if you had n't seen it already . as if the originals were n't bad enough . i 've never seen a movie so padded .... someone was milking the last dollar out of these films . total ripoff . and talk about padding ... why do i have to write 10 lines about this trash ? if i can convey that it 's garbage in 2 lines , that should be enough .
man oh man ! what a piece of crummy film-making ! but this is a guilty pleasure from my childhood even though i hate to admit it . they showed this movie on my basic cable system all the time . where i grew up in san jose , california ( right on the border of cupertino ) we had this thing called the g channel on our cable system . and they basically showed the same one movie over and over and over again . wanda nevada was one of those movies . i fell in lust and love with the young brooke shields and loved her dopey adventures in the grand canyon in the 1940s . the script makes almost no sense , the direction is poor , the few highlights are that henry fonda makes an appearance , a lot of dialog that 's so bad it 's good and a nice carole king song played over the end credits . maybe you have to be stoned to truly enjoy this flick . and hey , everybody knows there ai n't no gold in the grand canyon !
i wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist ( as this film was touted ) but this one failed me miserably . for me , the plot was a bit confusing to follow and i rapidly lost interest . i feel so sorry for john cusack , joan cusack , ben kingsley , marisa tomei and hillary duff for getting involved with this movie . i 'll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one . the one thing i can say positively about the film is that hillary played yonica 's character so well that i did n't even recognize hillary ; it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her . luckily i rented it for $ 1 through red box ; had i paid to see it in on the big screen , i would be really fuming ! !
if there was a scale below 1 , it would get a -10 , following in the footsteps of godspell . the acting ( if there was such a thing ) was atrocious , the plot in shambles . and rene russo was sickeningly sweet in her role , enough to make a person retch . ten thumbs down for a dumb movie . saving grace : kudos for era costuming .
i have a high tolerance for the weird , but frankly some movies go way , way beyond weird -- so far that they make your brain hurt . this is such a film . trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and i think the film is best understood while taking drugs -- it 's that incomprehensible . the film begins with some very cute japanese animation involving a cat . however , out of the blue , tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things occur -- making me wonder if i am losing something in the translation . however , even if this is so , why did we need to be treated to images of a magic trick involving dismembering a lady with a clever , defecation , puking , lighting animals on fire , etc .. all this really seemed random and pretty awful . oddly , and i do n't know why , some see this as a work of genius . i just do n't get that .
who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie ? accidental killing of a security guard ... characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them ... and better ... a red toolbox of death ? please .... hypothermic weak thugs ... acting from hell ... stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy , thriller , voyeurism and ... female ... ( uhm ) rambo ? unbelievable and it 's an insult to any thinking person . do not watch , walk away it 's more horrible than you may imagine ... and on top of it all it 's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it 's violence ... mrs montford : shoot 'em up was fun and funny , this is just pathetic and terrible . good luck next time . : - (
let me start by saying that i totally agree with the basic thesis of the film , that there probably was no historical jesus and christianity is a sham . with that said , this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis . it makes good arguments -- the gap between jesus ' theoretical life and the writing of the gospels , filled only by the writings of paul , who does n't indicate a historical jesus -- and then utterly fails to convincingly argue them . it makes broad statements without presenting the evidence the statements are based on , and it resolutely ignores counter-arguments presented by christian apologists . the intellectual dishonesty , emotional manipulation , and lack of serious argument are obvious , and stunning . the only christians we hear from in the film are the head of the filmmaker 's old school -- who comes off like a reasonable , rational person attempting to deal with a twit with a chip on his shoulder -- and various christians encountered apparently at random in a parking lot . i 'm sorry , but revealing that average christians do n't know much about their religion is n't exactly damning evidence of christianity 's fraudulence . you may as well claim that jay leno has disproved the existence of michael dukakis on his jay-walking segment . the interviews with experts can be interesting , but the film is filled with too much of , let 's be honest , the filmmaker just being snarky . within the first five minutes the film has already conflated jerry falwell with charles manson and the writers of the left behind series with the branch davidians . and by the end , the film becomes so self-centered that there 's no rational argument left , just an angry former christian lashing out at the people and places he blames for his messed up childhood . y'know , maybe that movie could 've been interesting , but it 's misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of jesus , and it 's so self-congratulatory as to deflate any sympathy . this is a michael moore film without the humor or the film-making acumen combined with a richard dawkins book without the wit or the intellectual rigor . skip it .
this film is terrible . you do n't really need to read this review further . if you are planning on watching it , suffice to say - do n't ( unless you are studying how not to make a good movie ) . the acting is horrendous ... serious amateur hour . throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen , only to find out that it is actually him ! a new low even for him ! ! the plot is terrible . people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before . even by the standard of hollywood action flicks , this is a terrible movie . do n't watch it ! ! ! go for a jog instead - at least you wo n't feel like killing yourself .
the 1930 ' were a golden age of los angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy . people were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams . expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom , majority then condemned to live starving , disillusioned and unwanted , searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms . young italian-american writer arturo bandini arrives to la on a similar quest - to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path , having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology . wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though , occasionally , he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive . he is proud to present himself as an italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his italian origin as a burden . the little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend . the coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her triggers a never-ending relationship of insults , unspoken excuses and a love concealed beneath . camilla being an uneducated girl trying to receive us citizenship through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a non-perspective racial heritage . though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful mexican woman is much harder to deal with than arturo is able to realize . is it obvious that arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel ? is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun ? is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn ? it is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters , performed by salma hayek and colin farrell , does not work . the relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings . hayek though livelier a character compared to farrell 's forgot to arm camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character frida . also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but uneducated and illiterate uses quite difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences . a tougher character of a phil marlowe sort would definitely suit farrell better , though he looks stunning in a period costume , he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty-year old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself . feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not right . their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm , far from real passion , feelings just described not felt inside . it is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted , turned into a grey average of soon-to-be-forgotten .
( 48 out of 278 people found this comment useful , and counting ... ) people are such suckers for image and looks - as much as for the intellectually hollow `` idealism '' that lurks behind communism . che 's charisma and looks have as much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda ( such as this movie ) about him . i do n't know what 's worse : being captured by one of che 's murder-squads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typically soderberghian garbage . the question is n't why this pet-project was made but what took them so long . by `` them '' i 'm referring , of course , to left-wing hollywood and its `` secret '' love of marxist tyrants ( lenin , castro ... take your pick ) . i am fascinated that it took decades for one of tinseltown 's least talented liberal directors to finally take on such an irresistibly biased propaganda project . where was oliver stone all these years ? robert redford ? tim robbins ? warren beatty ? alan pakula ? george clooney ? barbra streisand even ? it 's a mystery . all these overrated `` artists '' have often indulging themselves in similar , politically one-sided projects , yet somehow che guevara , who is arguably the most popular and well-known communist , has n't been a film topic of theirs yet . `` guerrilla '' has all the hallmarks of an american truth-bending story of an epic scale ; there is as much factual detail to be found here as in other similar hollywood big-budget political fairy-tale bios such as `` malcolm x '' or `` gandhi '' , i.e . almost none . the movie stars del toro as the famous argentinian revolutionary . nevertheless , however controversial and criminal this man 's actions may have been , one thing nobody could take away from him : he was an intelligent manipulator who came from a rich family - which is why del toro fits the bill only visually . del toro may be an interesting , charismatic actor and he may resemble guevara physically , but he exudes no intellectual qualities whatsoever , hence he makes guevara come off as too primitive . casting such mediocrities as bratt , philips and franka incompetente only underlines the director 's lack of sound judgment . the movie is to the most part extremely slow ( no surprise there ) , and visually uninteresting . even a director as brilliant as kubrick would have carefully considered releasing a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour mark , so it 's quite telling that this soderbergh , who has only made one or two solid movies and early on in his career , would think that his oceanic grandness was up to the task . if you think the film 's length indicates that a bulk of che 's life has been shown here - then think again . soderbergh focuses on che 's last phase , and a lot of the movie is tedious jungle nonsense , full of guevara 's alleged idealism . ( psychopaths do n't have ideals . ) i do wonder what kind of a mind this highly esteemed director has to have to actually choose to ignore some of che 's earlier life . did he actually consider it too uninteresting ? a massacre of 600 people holds no interest for the viewer , huh ? amazing . some much better directors than this over-praised charlatan would have easily fit not one but two complete biographies into a 4-hour movie . soderbergh , in a sense , becomes an accomplice by never addressing the negative , dark side - which is more than 90 % - of guevara . by spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy , consciously ignoring the ugly truth ( god forbid he should taint the holy image of che ) , soderbergh proves himself not a humanist - a fake image which most hollywood and pop music personalities struggle very hard all their careers to uphold - but the opposite : that he cares only about ideas , never about the people on whom these ideas are tested ( like on guinea pigs ) . soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind ; such people often have a latent contempt for the `` proleteriat '' ( what a stupid term ) they 're supposedly siding with . half of all students around the world wear che 's image on their red and orange shirts , but without ever knowing why . he has become an iconic figure for clueless , uninformed , very often young people , who think that by having this man 's face on their chest that somehow makes them appear `` edgy '' , intellectual , hip or interesting . in reality , wearing a che shirt only underlines one 's overall shallowness and total disinterest in self-education . ( would n't you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his/her face to the world ? ) wearing che 's by-now cliché image has become as common as having a bart simpson coffee cup . all those `` che-wearers '' probably know more about marge 's blue hair than they 'll ever read up on about fidel castro 's dead ally . after everything that 'd been done in the name of marx , one would think that these mongrel `` ideals '' would be finally laid to rest . it seems mankind will never learn . stalin , mao , kim il , pol pot , castro , milosevic , ceausescu , the iron curtain , a hundred million dead , more than a billion ruined physically and/or mentally through this system ... so none of that matters , huh ? the fact that del toro won a cannes award should only surprise those who are absolutely clueless as to how cannes and other european festivals work - and vote . hint : sean penn headed a jury not long ago . for my music-related rants , go to : http : //rateyourmusic.com/collection/fedor8/
i saw this in the summer of 1990 . i 'm still annoyed by how bad this movie is in 2001 . implausible plot . you 'd have to be a child to think this could happen . i 'm just really annoyed by it . do n't see this .
every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people . if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie , how great will be my joy . where to begin my discussion of pain . for starters , there was a musical montage every five minutes . there was no character development . every character was a stereotype . we had swearing guy , fat guy who eats donuts , goofy foreign guy , etc . the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot . the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation . have the directors , producers , etc . ever even seen a movie before ? halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry . the concept for this movie sounded so funny . how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors . but trust me when i say this , things went wrong , very wrong .
`` la furia del hombre lobo '' forms a completely stand-alone storyline which does n't seem to fit in at all with the previous waldemar daninsky movies . some have commented that this movie is supposed to take place before the events of `` werewolf shadow '' , although it was released afterwards ... they may be right , i 'm not sure . anyway , in this movie waldemar daninsky is bitten by a yeti-like creature in tibet ( great dialogue here -- `` it was a yeti . but that 's impossible . i 'm a scientist and these things do n't exist . it was a hallucination . that 's all . '' ) and although marked with the sign of the pentagram , he is able to prevent the change into a werewolf until he discovers that his wife has been cheating on him . changing into the beast one night , he kills both her and her lover before running out into a storm and being electrocuted . it 's not long before he 's resurrected by a dominatrix university professor who is conducting some kind of unfathomable experiments with mind control . he is taken to the underground cellar of a castle where the subjects of these experiments live like chained animals . first of all -- jacinto molina , paul naschy , whatever you want to call him , he 's a fine actor and cared passionately about his work . no matter how flawed these movies are , you can always rely on him for a decent performance . the rest of the cast seem good enough , but it 's hard to tell when they have a half-assed voice-over dubbed over all their lines . and that was really the main problem for me ... many of the voice-over artists they used were just awful , awful , awful . whenever i chuckled during the movie it was at the inept way that they delivered their lines ( they seem to constantly refer to the hero as `` waldeman '' ) . but unfortunately it 's almost impossible to find subtitled copies of naschy movies , although they 're sometimes available in the original language without subtitles . the directing of jose maria zabalza seems sort of hit-and-miss ... there are some great visual ideas in some scenes , while others are badly constructed and poorly edited , particularly in the final scenes when it really counts . the reason for this , was that zabalza was apparently drunk most of the time while on set . he allowed his fourteen year old nephew to rewrite molina 's dialogue , used extras without his permission , and spliced several shots from molina 's earlier movies . all of this pretty much ruined any chance this movie had of being one of molina 's best works , and it 's no surprise that the two of them never worked together again . but it 's not all bad news , as there are some good ideas here . some aspects of the storyline make an interesting psychological drama with the werewolf as a metaphor for jealousy and rage . the 'werewolf as a yeti ' idea is one that returned in molina 's later work . some pretty horrific and surreal stuff goes on down in the cellar , and there 's also a very memorable sequence about half way through the film where daninsky runs from house to house through a village , slaughtering or molesting innocents as he goes -- one scene is particularly intense , but it 's actually lifted straight from molina 's first movie , `` la marca del hombre-lobo '' along with a few other shots . i actually found the movie on the whole to be very entertaining , although there are some problems with the front row entertainment version , such as pretty obvious cuts ( although some of it may simply be due to the director 's lack of continuity ) . gods knows what omissions there are -- i 'll probably try to get my hands on the uncut version at some stage in the future . this is a overall a decent piece of vintage naschy which experienced fans might enjoy , but it could have been much better and so probably would n't make a great introduction .
i tried . i really did . i thought that maybe , if i gave joao pedro rodrigues another chance , i could enjoy his movie . i know that after seeing o fantasma i felt ill and nearly disgusted to the core , but some of the reviews were quite good and in favor , so i was like , `` what the hell . at least you did n't pay 10 dollars at the quad . give it a shot . '' sometimes it 's better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthetic to alleviate the horror of so much pain . i often wonder if it would n't be better to go back to my childhood and demand my former bullies to really let me have it . on other occasions , i often think that the world is really flat and that if i sail away far enough , i will not only get away from it all , but fall clear over , and that some evil , lovecraftian thing will snatch me with its 9000 tentacles and squeeze the life -- and some french fries from 1995 , still lingering inside my esophagus -- out of me . is there a reason for odete ? i 'd say not at all ... just that maybe her creator thought that writing a story centered on her madness ( one that makes alex forrest look like strawberry shortcake ) look not only creepy , but flat-out sick to the bone . she first of all decides to leave her present boyfriend ( in shrieking hysterics ) because she wants a child and he believes they 're too young . she later crashes a funeral of a gay man , and -- get this -- in order to get closer to him , she feigns being pregnant while insinuating herself into the lives of the dead man 's mother and lover in the sickest of ways . oh , of course , she shrieks like a banshee and throws herself not one , but a good three times on his grave . and there 's this ridiculous business that she progressively becomes `` pedro '' which sums up some weak-as-bad-tea explanation that love knows no gender . or something . i 'd say she 's as nuts as a can of cashews , unsalted . but then again , so 's the director . and me , for taking a chance on this . at least the men look good . other than that ... not much else to see here .
this movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film . you 've got future snl and sctv stars in their prime , such as john candy , chevy chase , laraine newman , al franken , tom davis and joe flaherty essentially making 70 minutes of coarse , uninspired fart and racist jokes . the concept of a network from the future subverting society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes , but instead right out the gate , makes a lame , juvenile proctology joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole way.seek out the earlier and much more subversive and witty groove tube or the later , hilarious kentucky fried movie . this movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad 70 's sketch comedy movies .
i sat glued to the screen , riveted , yawning , yet keeping an attentive eye . i waited for the next awful special effect , or the next ridiculously clichéd plot item to show up full force , so i could learn how not to make a movie . it seems when they set out to make this movie , the crew watched every single other action/science-fiction/shoot-em-up/good vs. evil movie ever made , and saw cool things and said : `` hey , we can do that . '' for example , the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking , is the one car the protagonist , an attractive brunette born of bile , is thrown on to . the car blows to pieces before she even lands on it . the special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie . but what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility , and lack of reason for so many elements ! for example , the antagonist , a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways , happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important vip . nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck , you know they are already dead . then the guy protecting the vip says `` under no circumstances do you leave this truck , do you understand me ? '' he gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies , he gets whacked in an almost comically cliché fashion . then for no apparent reason , defying logic , convention , and common sense , the dumb ass vip gets out of the truck ! ! ! a lot of what happened along the course of the movie did n't make sense . transparent acting distanced me from the movie , as well as bad camera-work , and things that just make you go : `` wow , that 's incredibly cheesy . '' shiri appleby saved the movie from a 1 , because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience , sex appeal .
notorious for more than a quarter century ( and often banned ) , it 's obscurity was its greatest asset it seems . hey , it 's often better to be talked about , rather than actually seen when you ca n't back the `` legend '' up with substance . the film has played in los angeles a couple of times recently , and is available on home video , so that veil is slowly being lifted . while there is still plenty to offend the masses , it is more likely to bore them , than arouse much real passion . except for a gratuitous and protracted xxx sex scene between a pair of horses ( `` nature documentary '' anyone ? ) , there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama . once the sex and nudity begins , it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation , a looooooooong flashback to an alleged 'beauty and the beast ' encounter , and a naked woman running around the mansion ( nobody , even her supposedly protective aunt , seems to even think of putting some clothes on her ! ) . on video , i guess you can fast-forward thru the banality , but it 's not really worth the effort . the nudity does n't go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as bertolucci 's the dreamers . try as one might to find some 'moral ' or 'symbolism ' in the carnality , i doubt it 's worthy of anyone 's effort . unfortunately , for la bete , now that you can more easily see the film , the notoriety of something once 'forbidden ' has been lifted . and this beast has been tamed .
this movie tells the tender tale of a demented scientist who , after his fiance is decapitated , goes around ogling strippers so that he can find a suitable body to attach her noggin to . everyone in this movie exudes more slime than a snail , particularly our protagonist .
the ladies man is a funny movie . there 's not much thought behind it , but what do you expect from an snl movie ? it 's actually better than most snl movies ( i.e . superstar or a night at the roxbury ) tim meadows and will ferrell were both very funny . chris parnell was also funny in his short scene ( one of the funnier ones in the movie ) . other than that , the rest of the cast is average and is just there to support meadows . i 've definitely seen funnier movies , but i 've seen dumber ones too . again , it 's not exactly a deep movie , but it 's good for a few laughs . it was funnier as a skit though . but still , if you 're looking for a pretty funny movie , i 'd recommend this one . just do n't think about it too much , or you 'll hate it . rating : 6/10
well , i can once and for all put an end to the question : 'what is the worst movie ever made ... ever ? ' it is flight of fury , starring and co-written by steven seagal . sure there are lots of famously bad movies , but this one takes the cake in that it takes itself so seriously . it is a romanian-made film that speaks to just how far romania has to go to catch up with bollywood . it also speaks to just how utterly devoid of intellect and talent steven seagal has become . this movie is so bad that you literally feel violated after watching it and need to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry , knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again . it was released only on video ( i ca n't imagine why ) and i suspect the workers that had to make the dvd 's had to wear protective gear and receive regular counseling .
this film is really terrible . terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life . special effects are so terrible . the acting was n't convincing . its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about `` blood surfing '' . blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a 31 foot crocodile interrupts there holiday . the sharks do n't look real . the crocodile is even worse , and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature , but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it . the deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time . a pointless , terrible film thats not worth seeing ! !
superhero movies pretty much always suck , and this is no exception . its only redeeming quality is the fact the movie could have been even worse . i would put 'batman & robin ' and 'steel ' above this movie , so yes it is that bad ... if your looking for a black superhero , check out 'blankman ' its not a `` serious '' superhero movie but at least its entertaining .
the author of numerous novels , plays , and short stories , w. somerset maugham ( 1874-1965 ) was considered among the world 's great authors during his lifetime , and although his reputation has faded over the years his work continues to command critical respect and a large reading public . published in 1944 , the razor 's edge is the tale of a world war i veteran whose search for spiritual enlightenment flies in the face of shallow western values . it was maugham 's last major novel -- and it was immensely popular . given that the novel 's conflicts are internalized spiritual and philosophical issues , it was also an extremely odd choice for a film version -- but darryl f. zannuck of 20th century fox fell in love with the book and snapped up the screen rights shortly after publication . according to film lore , the razor 's edge was to be directed by the legendary george cukor from a screenplay by maugham himself -- and it does seem that maugham wrote an adaptation . when the film went into production , however , cukor was replaced by edmund goulding , a director less known for artistic touch than a workman-like manner , and the maugham script was replaced with one by lamar trotti , the author of such memorable screenplays as the oxbow incident . tyrone power , recently returned from military service during world war ii , was cast as the spiritually conflicted larry darrell ; gene tierney , one of the great beauties of her era , was cast as socialite isabell bradley . the supporting cast was particularly notable , including herbert marshall , anne baxter , clifton webb , lucille watson , and elsa lanchester . both budget and shooting schedule were lavish , and when the film debuted in 1946 it was greatly admired by public and critics alike . but time has a way of putting things into perspective . seen today , the razor 's edge is indeed a beautifully produced film -- but that aside the absolute best one can say for it is that it achieves a fairly consistent mediocrity . as in most cases , the major problem is the script . although it is reasonably close to maugham 's novel in terms of plot , it is noticeably off the mark in terms of character and it completely fails to capture the fundamental issues that drive the story . we are told that larry is in search of enlightenment ; we are told that he receives it ; we are told he acts on it -- but in spite of the occasional and largely superficial comment we are never really told anything about the spiritual , artistic , philosophical , and intellectual processes behind any of it . we are most particularly never told anything significant about the nature of the enlightenment itself . it has the effect of cutting off the story at its knees . we are left with the shell of maugham 's plot , which centers on the relationship between larry and isabell , a woman larry loves but leaves due to the growing ideological riff that opens up between them . tyrone power and gene tierney were more noted for physical beauty than talent , but both could turn in good performances when they received solid directorial and script support . unfortunately , that does not happen here ; they are extremely one-note and power is greatly miscast to boot . fortunately , the supporting cast is quite good , with herbert marshall , clifton webb , and lucille watson particularly so ; the then-famous performance by anne baxter , however , has not worn as well as one would hope . with a running time of just under two and a half hours , the film also feels unnecessarily long . there is seemingly endless cocktail party-type banter , and indeed the entire india sequence ( which reads as faintly hilarious ) would have been better cut entirely -- an odd situation , for this is the very sequence intended as the crux of the entire film . regardless of the specific scene , it all just seems to go on and on to no actual point . as for the dvd itself , the film has not been remastered , but the print is extremely good , and while the bonus package is n't particularly memorable neither is noticeably poor . when all is said and done , i give the razor 's edge four stars for production values and everyone 's willingness to take on the material -- but frankly , this a film best left power and tierney fans , who will enjoy it for the sake of the stars , and those whose ideas about spiritual enlightenment are as vague as the film itself . gft , amazon reviewer
the '80 's were not very kind to one-time major star charles bronson . starting with 1982 's `` death wish ii '' and ending with this truly gruesome film from '89 , bronson 's screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness . `` d.w. ii '' left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of bronson 's character 's daughter , ( a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail ) . `` 10 to midnight '' was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards . nothing redeeming about it . other films like `` the evil that men do '' and the remaining `` death wish '' films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge . i 'm not sure if the producers ( usually pancho kohner ) got a kick out of showing a weary looking , senior citizen-aged bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what , but the shoddy craftsmanship ( and terrible scripts ) of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated . `` kinjite '' -- the last of these films -- is fairly well-made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness . in this film bronson : sodomizes a perverse john ; forces a pimp to eat his rolex watch ; allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner ; makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things i 've thankfully forgotten . also depicted is the gang-rape of a young japanese girl ( fortunately , this was off-screen , though well-implied ) . what were people thinking when they made this film ? what was bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films ? for anyone interested in his best movies , check out most of the films he made in the '60 's and '70 's like `` the mechanic '' , `` death wish '' , `` from noon til 3 '' , `` once upon a time in the west '' , `` red sun '' , `` the great escape '' , `` the magnificent seven '' , `` rider on the rain '' , etc. , etc ....
this is indeed quite the strange movie ... first , we have an ex-u.s.-gymnast trying to turn actor ( or something ) , and this seems to be the only role he ever got ( that i know of anyway ) -- and for good reason . while he does pull off the role well enough to keep some interest , it is a rather bland and flat performance . second , we have the worst ever sound effects ever used in a movie ! ! ! i 'm not kidding . this alone makes the movie extremely comical , but in that annoying way . hehe and third , while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast ( including the required hot chick ! ) , an actually not-so-bad story , and some cool visuals ; the dialogue , fight scenes involving gymnastics ( hilarious ! ) , and overall execution of the plot are weak . this movie would have been barely better as a network tv movie ( too bad fox was n't around in 1985 ) . it 's one of those movies that 's simply bad , yet you ca n't resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it , especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night tv and cable .
when i noticed that `` hamish macbeth '' was being broadcast in the united states , i was thrilled . i then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing . i adore m. c. beaton 's books about the wonderful scottish constable . the characters in the book are entertaining and very well-written . the powers that be who are responsible for this mish-mash apparently have never have read one of beaton 's books . only the name `` hamish macbeth '' has anything to do with the series . besides the lack of familiar characters , i find the whole show offensively loud . it seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other . if you love m. c. beaton 's adorable hamish macbeth do n't waste your time on this rubbish .
thomas archer ( ron eldard ) has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion . dr. heller ( christopher plummer ) tries to help him through the post traumatic stress . then archer finds himself confronted with a man ( til schweiger ) bound and gagged to a chair . he is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him . and there 's a large assortment of instruments there to help him ... film is interesting at first ( and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore ) but gets stupider by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns . it all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that i was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore . how such talented actors like eldard , schweiger and plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me . this gets three stars for the acting but the stupid plot and truly unbelievable twists make this a chore to sit through .
i suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early sofia loren film . she was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953 . i viewed this film because i wanted to see some of sofia loren 's early work . i was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an ethiopian princess . surely , today , this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making . it actually became annoying watching ms. loren in skin color paint throughout the film . yes , this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie . then , the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent . i discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight . as beautiful as ms. loren was at age 19 and still is today , the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage . after all , we do n't see beautiful young people on stage with `` old opera singers '' back stage singing from behind the curtain ! do not discount the success of using heavy-weight opera singers . one only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the j. g. wentworth company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company 's product . this is one of the best and entertaining tv commercials produced to date . the quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality . the color ink has faded much and that can not be helped . to improve this film on dvd the production company should add english language subtitles so that we , who do not speak italian , can know what the lyrics are saying . it would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes . watch this film not because of the story of aida nor the fact that this is an opera . aside from ms. sofia loren none of her co-actors are known nor remembered by this writer . instead , watch this movie if you are a fan of ms. loren and wish to see her at age 19 -- no matter what the production is . larry from illinois
the first ten minutes of `` just looking '' really dictates the direction most of this movie takes . lenny ( ryan merriman ) is a 14 year old boy living in new york in the '50s . he has a burning desire to see two people have sex . who are the best people he has in mind ? well , his own mom and stepfather of course ! how pleasant . unfortunately for lenny , he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle 's wife . lenny 's next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex . however , the wife is quite pregnant and they are n't currently sleeping together . then lenny makes a new friend . him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls . they have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex . the problem is ... it 's not done in an innocent , charming 1950 's sort of way . i am no prude by any means , but i found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation , blowjobs and anal sex . that kind of rawness may work in a movie like `` kids '' ( 1995 ) but in this film it just seems perverted . gretchen mol is utterly wasted here as hedy , a former bra model who becomes the object of lenny 's carnal desires . jason alexander needs to stay as far away from the director 's chair as possible . `` for better or worse '' ( 1996 ) was awful and now this . what a waste . 1/10
absolutely one of the worst movies of all time . low production values , terrible story idea , bad script , lackluster acting ... and i ca n't even come up with an adjective suitably descriptive for how poor joan river 's directing is . i know that there 's a special place in hell for the people who financed this film ; prolly right below the level reserved for child-raping genocidal maniacs . this movie is a trainwreck . ( terrible ) x ( infinity ) = rabbit test . avoid this at all costs . it 's so bad , it is n't even funny how bad it is .
possibly not , but it is awful . even the fantastic cast cant save it . ok , i admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the generals house . bill murray turned from being a quick witted , humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just were n't funny , its like he was trying too hard to be funny . his character stole a weapon ( an rv ? come on ... ) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers , for a laugh . one good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the us army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are , albeit unintentionally . i actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released .
fragmentaric movie about a couple of people in austria during a heatwave . this kind of movie has been done more often , and most of all , better . the stories do n't really have anything to do with each other , apart from the pathetic finale : 'people are cruel ' . ugly flesh , unpleasant people and a movie that goes on way too long without really making a point ... ultra-realistic ? hardly ... boring ? indeed . not even gorgeous franzisca weiss can save this one ! 3/10
this movie was disappointing . it was incomplete and dull . while alec baldwin tried to portray himself as the perfect fair and just prosecutor ( not to mention executive producer ) , the movie never showed any of the defense counsels or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible path . sure , nobody wants to defend the nazi 's point of view , but that was the point of the nuremberg trails ! four hours of simply bashing on the nazi 's .... c'mon ! thats been done already ! i really think alec baldwin should just stick to being kim bassinger 's husband . right after the movie ended , tnt showed the 1959 movie , trail at nuremberg . that movie is far superior .
sorry . someone has to say it . this really is/was a dull movie . worthy perhaps , but dull nonetheless . i nearly cried with boredom when watching it . the acting is pretty dire , the story drawn out and predictable , the score and camera-work totally standard and unexciting . it 's one of those movies you are not allowed to hate ( becase it is about disabled people ) but hate it i suspect nearly everyone does . it is interesting that critics have been so kind to this movie . i suppose they too are not allowed to be objective . this was made to win awards - which i remember it duly did . but it was neither interesting nor entertaining . i have n't seen the play so can not compare .
this is easily one of the worst martial arts films i 've ever seen , and that 's saying something . the chant of viva chiba , viva chiba is heard at the title , soon you will be chanting to yourself stupid , stupid . the basic story is that the mafia is running drugs into japan and one man vowels to stop them , of course that 's our man sonny chiba . the karate master offers up his service to anyone who can provide information on the drug lords . a woman comes forward and he becomes the bodyguard , but what are her true intentions ? let me say at this point who cares ? soon we are treated to or tortured by a series of poorly choreographed fights and a lame storyline that becomes more and more laughable at every moment . sonny eventually wipes out the bad guys with his karate skills , end of story . oh yeah the woman was corrupt too . congratulations you may have just watched the funniest film ever . as stated already this is one of the worst martial arts films i have ever seen . what makes it semi watchable is to see how badly made a film can be . some have already mentioned the infamous american intro put into the film . that 's probably the most entertaining part of the film and it 's beyond funny . i would agree its worth watching just to see how lame the 70 's karate scene was at the time . watch as aaron banks leaves a guy hanging by his nuts then flips a fat student ( bad editing ) punching him in the throat . but everything is badly done in this film . terrible unbelievable fights , fake i mean fake blood , bad acting , dubbing , wardrobe , and let 's not forget the story . one man to take out an entire drug problem in a country ? i bet . fight after fight is laughable . this was the 70 's when people still believed karate was effective in a fight , but chiba brings it to new levels with some of the nonsense put out in this movie . let 's see he kicks a gun in half , kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene , give me a break . not to mention the fact that it 's very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it 's filmed so poorly . one part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture . ok. as the action goes on we are treated to gobs of blood , really fake blood . too say it looked poorly made is and understatement . the acting is totally non existent in this film . i do n't expect much from a film of this caliber anyway as long as the action is good , but it was n't and as expected the dubbing is extremely poor . was it my imagination or did they dub the asian go go dancer with a black accent ? as expected from a 70 's wardrobe you 'll be in stitches laughing at some of the trends and nasty women put forth for the gratuitous nudity that comes with these flicks . also why would the mafia be so obvious and all where black trench coats and hats all the time ? do n't try and hide it now . the characters were stupid as well . the pimp club owner 's one of whom is decked out in a japanese pimp suit and the other who has a taste for bores head looks like fat hippie . also one last thing that bothered me throughout the film was the awful music with some woman whaling . it was very annoying . overall this is a terrible film by both martial arts standards and good movie making . that does n't mean that it 's not entertaining . with a film made so poorly it 's hard not to laugh through most of this film , if you can stomach it . this was an old favorite watch with my best friend . if it was purely bad i would give one star , but the laughs it delivers bumps it up . 4 out 10 .
hmmm , a sports team is in a plane crash , gets stranded on a snowy mountain , and is faced with the difficult decision to eat the flesh of their dead companions in order to survive . sound familiar anyone ? i refer to `` alive '' from 1993 . the only major difference here , of course , is that a big , white , drunken scare crow of a yeti shows up a few times to drag off the dead . i guess humans taste better than yaks . stupid : the man in the first scene does not have a reliable firearm when hunting the yeti , nor does he have a backup . the plane crash is completely bogus . it would have either exploded in the air , exploded when it hit the ground , or become obliterated . the people would not have survived , but hey , it 's sci-fi . stupid : they survived , and they are cold . it might be a good idea to harness some of the burning debris nearby so as not to freeze to death . fire being warm as it is ... wtf : the pilot has frost formed all over his face while he 's alive and talking , but oddly enough , no one else does . stupid : one of the guys tells the others to look for matches and lighters , but there are scattered parts of the plane on fire all around them . stupid : they find coats and hoodies , and yet there in the cold of the himalayas , they fail to use the hoods ! stupid : they 're staring at a pile of sticks when , i reiterate , there are pieces of the plane already burning . stupid : the himalayas are notorious for its storms . it would be common sense for them to collect the debris in order to reinforce their structure rather than sitting outside bickering . there are a lot of pine trees around , the branches of which make excellent insulation . wtf : when in doubt , use a dead man 's arm as a splint . wtf : if the one guy knows so much about the hibernation habits of squirrels , bears , and leopards in the himalayas , then why does n't he know enough to make shelter and set traps right from the start ? stupid : when attempting to trap wild animals , mindless conversation in the vicinity of said trap always helps . wtf : do you know how hard it would be to cut a frozen corpse with a shard of glass ? ! wtf : the group was ready and armed to fight the yeti while the other two were standing there defenseless . the yeti ripped out the guy 's heart and stomped the girl 's head , and the gang did nothing . there 's love . so two yetis and a convenient avalanche to bury the evidence forever .... or so we think . mwuhahahaa ! the story continues into more idiocy but the most action occurs in the last 15 minutes , as usual . nice thinking with the javelin and the chain , although this is some ingenuity ( with the magically-appearing chain ) that they lacked in the beginning of the movie when they could n't even make fire despite the fact that it was all around them . as is typical for the sci-fi originals , the loving couple kisses at the end like nothing horrible has just happened to them ( not to mention they ate human flesh and have n't brushed their teeth in several days ) . the very end , however , is quote lame .
i had never read gary paulsen 's novel , hatchet , for which ' a cry in the wild ' is the adaptation of , so i ca n't make any comparisons to the book . i will , however , say that as a film on its own , adaptation or no adaptation , it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters . think of ' a cry in the wild ' as a less luxurious , teenage mountaineer ( was quincy , california the only place this was filmed ? ) version of 'cast away . ' jared rushton is 13-year-old brian roebson , a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father , until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain , leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself . there are basically three parts to the film . the obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters , namely brian and his mom . the next third of the movie ( which really consumes nearly all of the film ) is that of brian `` roughing it . '' these scenes contain no particularly amazing action , nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful yukon landscape . nothing to put you on edge , no real encounters ( except a brisk confrontation with a cub ) , and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen . you might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness brian dealing with his situation through first , primitive means , and then more improved ones ( using tools , etc ) for his survival . it is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation , and that is pretty much about it . in other words , they put no meat on the paulsen 's words when they translated them into a visual media . and , of course , the third part of the movie is his rescue . there is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time , however . some conflict between brian and his parents that created a rocky , awkward relationship between them . however , for the most part , it is only explained in brief , intermittent , minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video . any minute , the singer from jefferson starship , should chime in an start singing 'sara . ' other than what the viewer can draw from the implications , or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative , we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters , whether or not it really had anything to do with brian 's survival adventure in the third part of the movie . these are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and , for me , almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more ! it certainly was not , for me , a good adventure tale . but , for fans of jared rushton , it was one of the last few movies he made . so , watch it purely for nostalgia , if nothing else .
i saw this recently on a faded old vhs tape , and remembered it dimly . looking at it now , it seems charming . when it was first released , it was recognized by pretty much everyone as a spoof of coming out as a gay teenager . to hammer the point home , the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of `` 1 teenager in 10 '' , the most popular coming out book of the time . david warner hams it up as the persecuting vampire hunter [ = gay-hating evangelist ] , who is of course a self-loathing closet case . the list of sight gags and in-jokes that were included to make sure nobody missed the point would be too long to go into . the producers were having some good-natured fun , and hoping , no doubt , to lighten-up as well as to enlighten . but i have no clue how a teenage audience would look at this film , nowadays . in some places , where there is education and culture , the terrifying ordeals that gay teens had to go through are a thing of the past . but i 'm sure there are plenty of dark , nasty corners of our continent where it 's just as bad as it always was .
while the original titillates the intellect , this cheap remake is designed purely to shock the sensibilities . instead of intricate plot-twists , this so-called thriller just features sudden and seemingly random story changes that serve only to debase it further with each bizarre development . worst of all , replacing the original spicy dialog is an overturned saltshaker full of unnecessary four-letter words , leaving behind a stark , but uninteresting taste . there was promise -- unfulfilled promise . the prospect of michael caine pulling off a patty duke-like keller-to-sullivan graduation is admittedly intriguing . unfortunately , this brilliant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation , first by accepting the role in this horribly re-scripted nonsense and then by turning in a performance that only looks competent when compared to jude law 's amateurish overacting . if you have n't seen the classic original , overlook its dated visuals and gimmicks . hunt it down , watch it , and just enjoy a story-and-a-half . as for the remake , pass on this insult to the original .
it 's hard to praise this film much . the cgi for the dragon was well done , but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow . also , the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious . i was amazed to see `` marcus aurelius '' in the acting credits , wondering what an ex-emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film ! like `` whoopie goldberg '' it must be an alias , and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker . the story might been interesting , but the acting is flat , and direction is tedious . if you must watch this film , go around to your friend 's house and get drunk while doing so - then it 'll be enjoyable .
there have been more interesting polish documentaries on worm farming , in brail_ ! ! the competition ( worm farming ) had a better plot and more interesting characters . i was physically ill after watching this movie . the cheating husband ( i think dougray_scott_ ) was a joke in every meaning of the word . poor jennifer must really need the work , and what was with the accent ! ! . the locations and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank , and showed the humility of a 10 year old in cooking class . it was that bad that i think i will write the sequel named `` this is not a laxitive '' . thank you for listening it was a great weight of my conscious .
john carpenter 's career is over if this sad excuse for a movie is any indication . his excuse is that he only produced it . jon bon jovi looks like a girl . in fact , bon jovi and the two vampire girls , natasha wagner and arly jover probably all fit in the same clothes . in short , it was hard to tell which one was cuter in an anorexic ramp-model sort of way . bon jovi has the most charisma . at least he looks happy when he is smiling . the two vampire girls on the other hand are all cramps and complaints . at one point they are about to give each other a wet kiss , but stop . amazing how each vampire movie has some set of morays for the respective vampires . at one point , arly jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb vampire hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act . it would have been an erotic moment except that it was filmed like a total goof , and the male actor looked mildly amused as he watched arly jover move her head to mimic something that was very obviously not happening . as far as gore is concerned , a few heads are ripped off , and the blood spurts profusely . these scenes have so little suspense or build-up that when they happen it is almost funny , and there is no `` horror '' pay-off from the scene . all you get as a member of the audience is a feeling of `` wow , that sure was a lot of red paint splattering on the walls . i wonder who has to clean it up . '' throughout the movie , these vampire hunters who are obviously trying to kill arly jover ( the top vampire in the world ? ? ) keep reaching out to her . at one point , bon jovi goes into the abandoned church and after he just shot her with an arrow ( and has done so on other occasions ) , he says `` i am not trying to hurt you . i just want to talk to you . i want to get to know you . '' huh ? ? of course , the dumb vampire arly jumps out to say hello and bon jovi sticks her again with another impaling device . `` why ca n't we be friends '' the 1970s hit song by war should have been the theme song for this movie . aside from all of the other silly moments , there is a transfusion sequence when natasha wagner has all her vampire blood removed , and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion . i guess blood type is not important ? anyhow , all her vampire blood is removed . bon jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him , he can beat arly by becoming a vampire also . of course , as the vampire blood is transfused into him , none of his healthy blood is removed . so apparently bon jovi is walking around with twice as much blood as any human can have in his body . and just like the first vampires , this one also has the vampires-bursting-into-flames special effect .
well , i guess i 'll have to be the one to say `` the emperor has no clothes . '' when i saw this show listed for pbs last night i was both hopeful and apprehensive . i loved `` morse '' ( even going so far as to buy the complete dvd set ) and felt that , while i always liked kevin whately 's sgt . lewis character , the show was john thaw , period ! after watching the new `` inspector lewis '' ( as it is billed here ) , i am more convinced then ever that i was right ... whately is fine ( even though he looks awful ( both badly aged and too fat ) , but he simply does n't have the charisma to carry the show as did thaw . and as for his `` sidekick '' fox , well ... perhaps the reviewers here from england can understand what he 's saying , but i for one mostly could not . as for ms. innocent ... all i can say is that i miss james grout . i 'm sorry to say that they should have left `` morse '' rest in peace .
carnosaur 3 is bad ... awfully bad . bad to the point where it is funny . how matter how much i try to convince myself , i just ca n't believe anyone in this world could find this entertaining for serious reasons . i mean , come on , even the cover is bad ! ok , the special effects are absolutely ridiculous . those `` carnosaurs '' are really ridiculous . a scientist tells the soldiers that they move incredibly fast , yet when you see them run , they run at the speed of ... an actor in a rubber suit trying to run as much as he can . and the explosions are funny ( there is no other word to describe it ) . at the beginning , a bullet hits a jeep after a guys says `` what was that ? '' ... and the other explosions are also laughable . but the worst thing is the screenplay and the so-called story . you do n't expect a good story ( or , i do n't think anyone renting this movie expects a good movie ) but at least the story has to try to make sense . i mean , how hard is it to make a story about dinosaurs killing people at least coherent . incredibly hard if you look at this . oh , and if you think that it 's easy to makes believable commandos as your characters , tell it to the writers of this awful , awful piece of crap . i mean , what sick human being would make cheap jokes after one of his buddies is dead ? and they do lots of it . and if you think that a movie about dinosaurs killing soldiers can only be at least action-packed , wake up ! ! ! this movie is incredibly dull . the carnosaurs ( who invented this lame name anyway ? ) attack ( in boring action sequences where you do n't see much happening ) . the soldiers think of how to beat them ( in incredibly funny scenes where they try real hard to be serious but ca n't seem to convince even just one second ) . so , then , they attack the carnosaurs , but their idea does n't work ( another laughable action sequence ) . back to planning ( with a few lame jokes thrown in ) in another ridiculous scene . and this goes on , and on , and on . and let 's not forget the acting which is about as convincing as the special effects ... and the story ... oh ok , this movie simply sucks from a to z .
i am a lover of b movies , give me a genetically mutated bat and i am in heaven . these movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world . even a stupid b movie will usually make me laugh and i will still consider it a good thing . then there was hammerhead , which was so awful i had to register with imdb so i could warn others . first there was the science of creating the shark-man , which the movie barely touched on . in order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes . during one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead ( what fabulous special effects ) . back to the science , i thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue . anyway this movie had poor plot development , terrible story , and i 'm sorry to say pretty bad acting . not even william forsythe , hunter tylo or jeffrey combs could save this stinker .
in são paulo , the upper middle class teenagers cristiano , chico and gabriel have just joined the university and on the eve of the opening class , they go to a party with drugs and booze . on the next day , after their classes , the date of cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl . the girl dies , they panic and decide to get rid off the body , but cristiano 's mother arrives , startles with gabriel and rolls the staircase , breaking her neck . the trio decides to dump and burn the corpses in a garbage landfill , but along the night other tragedies happen . the polemic and shameful `` cama de gato '' is an overrated pretentious crap about alienation of the youth , and is certainly the worst brazilian movie that i have seen along many years . the shallow , tragic and dark story is actually a black humor comedy of bad taste . the screenplay is not funny , with stupid lines and dialogs , and boring , manipulative and silly footages with interviews with morons teenagers in the beginning and in the end . the acting is terrible , apparently with many improvisations , but no talent , and i was disappointed with presence of the promising caio blat in this trash . the camera , framing , cinematography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality . the sound is awful and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actresses are speaking ( probably it is a plus , since this flick sucks ) . the gang bang is very realistic and used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex-exploitation . my vote is one ( awful ) . title ( brazil ) : `` cama de gato '' ( `` bed of the cat '' )
in recent times i have been subjected to both this movie and `` king arthur '' , on dvds chosen by others for an evening 's `` entertainment '' and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion i have that the modern movie-watching public totally lacks discrimination , and is content as long as they get `` action '' . both movies were utter rubbish . whatever happened to character development ? whatever happened to meaningful dialogue ? whatever happened to acting ? and , when watching something that vaguely purports to be `` historical '' , whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy , some realistic idea of the `` political map '' of the time , even some slight flavour of the era , especially in its social attitudes . why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century america ? i have read on the message boards of disclaimers that `` little was known '' of the dark ages . not so . considerable amounts are known , with much learned scholarship on the era , but these jokers simply could n't be bothered to do any homework . i only wish i could vote 0/10
this uk psychological thriller is known in the united states as closure . exploitation of x-files ' gillian anderson , who plays an attractive middle aged businesswoman of substance named alice . she must attend a business party and invites adam ( danny dyer ) , who just installed a security system for her , to be her escort . on the way home , speeding through the woods on a narrow lane , alice 's auto collides with a deer . after pulling the wounded animal off the road , the couple is savagely attacked by a drunken gang of thugs . adam is beat to a pulp ; alice is gang raped and both are emotionally and physically devastated by the ruthless attack . when the identities of their attackers are discovered , alice and adam set out to exact revenge ... brutal revenge . the couple at times find themselves at odds on how to deal with the ruthless attackers . their final decision is to avenge with no mercy . let there be no mistake , payback is hell . also in the cast : anthony calf , ralph brown , francesca fowler and antony byrne . brutal violence , disturbing images , nudity and graphic rape .
some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous . not painful to watch with your significant other ? i was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie . it was so slow and awfully strange . both redgraves , vanessa and natasha were unfit for this , especially with vanessa doing that ridiculous brash american accent . claire danes was the same wiggly-lipped awkward girl that she was in my so-called life . she has yet to push herself in any way . girl , find a new way to pretend to cry ! meryl streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie , she was on screen for five minutes , and i swear to god , she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake . oh ! and hugh dancy , who gets better every time i see him . glenn close and eileen atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes . i mean , this was a well-shot movie , it was very pretty , the settings were interestingly dressed , providing relief for the intense boredom i was feeling . i do n't know , it 's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of `` the greatest actresses of our time '' sucks so much . it sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors , and the main character ( ann ) was a huge jerk . i was glad she died . but that 's because i felt bad for lila , ann 's friend -- mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy . ugh . bad job , evening the film . you were n't entertaining and you were n't even thought-provoking . i sure hope the book was better , so it did n't waste even more of people 's time . 3/10
a group of people are invited to there high school reunion , but after they arrive they discover it to be a scam by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on . now , he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all telephone lines . dark slasher film with an unexceptional premise . bringing it up a notch are a few good performances , some rather creative death scenes , plenty of excitement & scares , some humor and an original ending . unrated for extreme violence , graphic nudity , sexual situations , profanity and drug use .
a wonderful television mini-series completely ruined by a 45-year old woman trying desperately to pass herself off as a 16-year old ingenue ! no exaggeration - that 's the actual age of the character played by ali macgraw when the film opens just prior to the surprise attack at pearl harbor . this tv mini-series really is the most classic example of the title of this post and one i refer to whenever the topic comes up . that alone makes this completely unwatchable , despite the fact it 's one of the best filmed wwii 'global ' dramas tv has ever produced . if you have the stomach - or a decent fast-forward ability - you might be able to enjoy the late robert mitchum in a very strong performance . i 'm stunned at some of the comments referring to the love story ( pun intended ) . did they watch the film with their eyes closed ? or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their `` selective memories '' and `` selective vision '' . i 'm a boomer myself so do n't think for a second i 'm some hubristic young punk . 45 will always look 45 . get used to it . deal with it . age gracefully damnit . the winds of war could have been ... so good . how much more would we be talking about this mini-series today , some 25 years later , had an actual ingenue been cast in such an important & critical role ? right now , with the constant haggard old biddy distraction , that alone cancels out most of the wonderful aspects of the winds of war .
i never was an avid viewer of `` crocodile hunter '' , but did occasionally see an episode , or a bit of an episode , and when the news spread about steve irwin 's death from a stingray attack in 2006 , it certainly caught my attention . this movie , with steve and his wife , terri , playing themselves , but in a fictional story , was released in 2002 , but i did n't hear of it until several years later , and even after that , it took me a while to get around to seeing it . well , now i have seen it , and after looking here first ( more than once ) , and seeing its rating , i was not surprised at how unimpressive it turned out to be , though it could have been a bit better . apparently , it 's supposed to be a comedy , so a major problem with it is that it is n't very funny at all . a u.s. satellite beacon falls down from space and lands in australia , where it is swallowed by a crocodile ! while steve and terri irwin are on a mission to capture this crocodile from a place where it terrorizes the cattle on a ranch owned by the crazy brozzie drewitt , and are unaware of what 's inside it , two cia agents are sent to australia to retrieve the beacon ! the agents are assisted by jo buckley , and the ranch owner and her dogs might make the mission more difficult for them ! on steve and terri 's mission , they face other types of dangerous wildlife , not just the crocodile , and since they have no clue that the croc has anything unusual inside it , when steve sees the cia agents after them , he mistakes them for poachers ! not only did i not laugh once while watching this film , the only part that really made me smile was steve irwin using a big snake to scare off one of the cia agents . apart from that , i do n't think i found anything even mildly amusing . it 's also a bit of an incoherent mess , switching back and forth from the australian outback to the cia headquarters , and it seems like clips from `` crocodile hunter '' and clips from an action thriller ( or something like that ) put together for some reason . also added to that mix are the ranch scenes , which also seem to be from somewhere else , and as funny as brozzie drewitt , played by magda szubanski , is supposed to be , she 's not . at one point , we see her farting , so we have a fart joke , a major cliché in modern comedy ! are they so hard to resist ? ! i also found the typical `` crocodile hunter '' scenes , with steve wrestling crocodiles and holding other dangerous creatures and talking about them to viewers , to be tedious , but i guess the fact that i was never a devout fan of the show did n't help . steve irwin was admired by many as a conservationist , and is sadly missed by them , while there are also those who say he messed with nature and had it coming to him . no matter which side you 're on , `` the crocodile hunter : collision course '' is not a well crafted movie . i 'm sure it does help if you 're a big steve irwin fan , but even if you are , there 's no guarantee that you would like this movie , as some fans clearly have n't been impressed . in fact , it seems that some of them have found this movie to be worse than i have , so maybe it wo n't help . like i said , there 's no guarantee . i would say whatever you may think of steve irwin and his show , this movie was unnecessary . the attempt to combine what is usually seen in `` crocodile hunter '' with a fictional story unfortunately failed , and a viewer may find that this film seems longer than ninety minutes !
as a great admirer of marlene dietrich , i had to ( finally ) watch this very , very dull picture . it is miss dietrich 's first color film , and the world 's most beautiful blond is a redhead ! bad start . the story is a tremendous bore , involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff : religious guilt . ( who needs it ? ? ? ) suffice it to say , perhaps , that of all dietrich 's films ( and i have seen most , including `` pittsburgh '' ) this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching . the color photography is ok ( this is a very early technicolor release ) , but to no purpose . ridiculous casting : c. aubrey smith , basil rathbone ( enough said ? ) . the only thing of any interest at all is john carradine 's outlandish caricature of a performance as `` the sand diviner , '' who foretells all that will happen . the supposed `` happy ending '' is one of the most depressing ever conceived . yet another example of david o. selznick 's highly inflated reputation ( did he ever make a really good film ? -- other than that one ? ) and , for one final annoyance , the soundtrack of the mgm dvd is a mess , with volume levels seemingly randomized . highly unrecommended .
this has got to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen . it is ( i think ) a story of a rebellious college basketball player , his tough-but-fair coach , his girlfriend , and a fellow student ( played by michael margotta ) who has continual nervous breakdowns . the story goes nowhere , there is zero character development , there is nobody to care about , and the performances , with the exception of bruce dern as the coach , are terrible . it is hard to believe how a talent like jack nicholson could direct such an awful movie . make sure to avoid this turkey .
that 's right , you heard me this movie is a freaking ' abomination . first off , the band , who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called `` the naked brothers band '' ? ! ? ! not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians , they ca n't even play anything ! also , the lead singer sounds more girly than geddy lee , and even more his voice is horrible ! not only are they terrible musicians but they 're terrible actors . led by a crappy director and thin plot , this has got to be the dumbest movie ever . i wish this website would let you use a vote of zero or below out of 10 , because giving this filth a 1/10 is being way too generous . i 'm not sure that you can call this a comedy film . if you 're looking for comedy with music , go to that `` weird al '' yankovic guy 'cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens .
this film is a portrait of the half-spastic teenage boy benjamin who has to visit a boarding school because of his lousy marks in math . he did n't make the best experiences in life before and got serious self-esteem issues . after a rough start at his new school , he starts making friends , falls in love with a girl and does some american pieish teenage stuff . beside some comedy elements , the film is told in a very serious way , focussing on benjamin and his problems . if you already do n't like this story outline , save your time and watch something else . if you do , please be aware of the following : 1 ) benjamin is a total loser . whatever he does , he does it terribly wrong and then he goes for self-pity all the time . for me he was n't that kind of `` charming loser '' who you can feel sympathy for and laugh with . instead he and his behavior really annoyed me and with my own teenage years not so far behind i could barely stand watching . 2 ) the film hardly tries to be realistic and the story seems to be but from my experience the characters just are n't ( except for janosch maybe ) . and yes , i know this film is based on an auto-biography written by a 17-year old - but having some experiences with german schools and german youth myself , i do n't believe him . 3 ) showing the sexual awakening really is an important thing for a film with this subject . but i doubt that teenage boys do an `` ejaculate on the cookie '' -contest where everyone has to hit a cookie with his sperm during mass-masturbation in the woods and the loser has to eat the sperm-wet cookie afterwards . although it kinda amused me in a contemptible way , it 's nor funny neither underlining the serious attempts of this film . 4 ) there 's a sub-plot about benjamin 's family and his father betraying his wife - still , i do n't know why it 's there and where to put it . it just bored me . well , i personally hated this film for having the character of benjamin , being without a message , concept , scheme , whatever and it 's failing attempts to be dramatic and serious . however , i can image that some people may find it sensible and touching . if you liked `` the other sister '' you 'll probably like this one , too . i hated both . 17-year old boys should n't write an autobiography and if they do , it does n't seem to be the best idea to make a film out of it . 2 out of 10 .
i had high hopes for this film , because i thought clean , shaven ( kerrigan 's first feature ) was absolutely terrific , the most assuredly cinematic low budget film i 'd ever seen . but much of claire dolan is utterly pointless and flat . scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix , without much thought for narrative or character . is claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not ? hard to tell . why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life ? why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in seattle ? why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color ? why does claire accept some johns and not others ? the filmmaker does n't seem to know . it feels as if everything is improvised ( though i understand this was n't the case ) and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary . after the screening i saw , kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative . it sounded like learned rhetoric . i think it was a cop-out . i am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as clean , shaven would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old `` political '' cliches .
just finished watching , ca n't say i was impressed . it starts of quite good , the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should . but it all ends when the first lordi monster appears . not only do you recognize them from the band lordi , but they are seriously malplaced in the movie . doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80 's . as for the storyline , it starts of as similar horror movies , people trapped inside a hell hole . but there is no clear story on why and what is happening . the viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons , but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess . with all the money spent on this film , with an intriguing start and some good effects , i had thought someone would have taken better care of the product . i wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary ( except they are n't ) . so the movie gets cred for the visuals , i guess the money had to go somewhere . but the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their on-stage monster aliases scarier .
i 'm here again in your local shopping mall ( of course , 'cause that 's where the high school kids hang out ! ! ! ! ! ) to demonstrate how awful `` bendy poo : prom courier '' really is ! ! ! ! ! to prove how bad this joke of a dcom this is ... ... we 're going to take these four sumo wrestlers , and stuff them into this photo booth . how ... cozy ! ! ! ! ! hai ! huuuuuuuarrrrghhhhhh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! uh ! ! ! ! ! how awful is it ? ? ? ? ? it 's so bad , disney channel flushes away its money , yet again , with those exciting yet determining 10-second promos , keeping the viewers wondering , `` when is this going to be on ? ? ? ? ? '' and then , suddenly , when it does come on , for one , this not only got a higher tv rating than usual , but this was only seen once ! ! ! ! ! oh , no ! ! ! ! ! one time everyone ! ! ! ! ! plus , this movie is about high school and stuff , and believe me , i will not go any further with what else is in there ..... say ch ... smile ! ! ! ! ! ( snap ! ) avoid this one at all costs . 0/10
i was duped into seeing this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man was i p.o 'd ! ! ! it took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up off the shelf b/c i did n't want anyone to see me . then another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it . i thought that all my stress would pay off by the time i got home to and watching the movie b/c the review i read said the movie was a pleasant surprise ; what a joke ! if you can make it through the first hour of the movie then your in luck ! b/c it 's not until then the movie turn 's into a horror . do n't bother with this one folks , your better off watching `` dankness falls ''
sorry , gave it a 1 , which is the rating i give to movies on which i walk out or fall asleep . in this case i fell asleep 10 minutes from the end , really , really bored and not caring at all about what happened next .
evidently lots of people really like this , but i found it infantilising and reasonably offensive codswallop , saved from oblivion by jane russell and a couple of memorable musical numbers , especially the opener ( but there 's a marked dip in invention later on ) . i do n't get on with monroe - she 's supposed to be playing a dumb blonde who ai n't that dumb , but she just comes over as dumb . russell ca n't quite convince when she claims never to have been in a gymnasium , but is otherwise rather wonderful . the men are staggeringly uninteresting , as is the plot . by no means atrocious , but so patchy that , if this is a classic , god help us all .
i 've seen thousands of movies and have never written a review , but the red eye i witnessed is so at odds with the glowing tributes posted here that i 'm compelled to offer my two cents in protest- and vote the lowest score possible just to bring the average closer to reality . this is a dull , boring stinker of a film that is memorable only for its apologist depictions of the terrorists ' target ( a john bolton-esquire bully diplomat who 's really a great guy , do n't you know ) and of the oh-so-handsome and popular dr. phil ( whose bestselling book , one learns , is read by frequent fliers worldwide ) . the only real red eye i experienced was from rubbing my eyes in disbelief . before you fork out $ 10 or so dollars for this b movie , read the selected 'quotes ( from trailer ) ' above , and ask yourself if you 'll really enjoy a movie in which these were the cleverest lines to be found . unfortunately , nothing else in this film is any better . the basic premise is goofy as hell ; the acting is bland and uninspired , completely lacking in pro/antagonist chemistry ; the potential for suspense is thwarted at every turn- except during the last five minutes- by poor directing and anticipatory editing ; the script is riddled with incongruities like : early reveals of the heroine as a university lacrosse star are called into question when she later battles the antagonist with a field hockey stick ; and the plot holes are wider than first class ( while character development is strictly coach ) . and then there are the moments of extreme ridiculousness , like when the daughter of a high level public servant does not head straight for airport security , at her first opportunity , to warn them of an assassination plot against the both the head of homeland security and her father . or when that same woman runs hell-bent-for-leather along slick airport linoleum , arms pistoning and veins in her neck bulging , while wearing 4 inch stiletto heels . or when her pursuer chases likewise with a sucking wound in his trachea . or when terrorists use a fishing pole to bring up their weapon from the freaking harbor bottom . i 'm always willing to suspend disbelief , but i 'm not going to leap from 30,00 feet without a parachute . the one good thing i can say of this movie is that it portrays women who are capable ( even in bimbo form ) of handling the most extreme emergencies- the kind of gender imaging sorely lacking in american movies . other than that , this movie never really takes off , and is no more thrilling than the red eye flight from boston to ny . remember the last time you got suckered by deceptive trailers and glowing tributes- in this forum or elsewhere ? this is one of those times . wait for the red eye video , and do n't watch it then , either .
this may not be the worst comedy of all time , but it 's close . the producers of this movie stole an hour and a half of my life , and i want it back ! chris kattan is funny for about 10 minutes . his high pitched voice and mad flailing start to get old , and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse . he falls into a long line of former snl-ers that have attempted movies . some have been brilliant , some have failed miserably . there 's not much middle ground in this category . although chris farley was brilliant , and then okay , and then not so funny , and then dead ... so i suppose he hits the entire spectrum in one career . avoid this movie like the plague . c
first of all i just want to say that i love this show ! ! ! but this episode ... this episode makes a mockery of the entire show . i do n't know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series . there is no story line , everything is chaotic and the jokes ..... are crap . the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game ..... for example `` how do the furlings look like '' by creating that stupid `` previously on ... '' ...... is simply embarrassing . its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad .
i just saw this movie on a local tv station ( tv8 's `` big chuck and little john '' in cleveland , ohio ) i had never heard of this movie and decided to watch it . i know of no thesaurus that can even come close to aiding me in describing how bad this movie really is . the script is awful . the acting , well other than one of two exceptions , is pointless since there is nothing in this material that merits any real effort . it looks like a bunch of little ideas , leftover from various writing sessions , that where thrown into a blender . it 's not just funny . the `` parody '' aspect is strained at best . some references where almost out of date ( even for the time of it 's release ) . no wonder i had never heard of it , it 's really bad , worse than anything saturday night live , mad tv or even in living color put out in their worst days . if you see it on tv , it is a great example of how not to make a movie . whatever you do do n't waste a cent . adam
i just saw this film last night in the 2006 tribeca film festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them . the film was simply awful - i say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was awful . matthew modine 's days as a leading man are way over . gina gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary english accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film . gloria reuben had a weird little cameo in it - she should also be ashamed . the script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters . i highly doubt this will be picked up , but then again , people in hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes . i really think `` kettle of fish '' is a serious contender for the worst movie i 've ever seen .
i foolishly read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago , and said to myself , `` seems funny , plus it has michael clarke duncan , how can i lose ! '' i proceeded to pay $ 15.99 plus tax for it . i took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted . wooden performances abound . all the `` hilarious '' and `` outstanding '' performances promised never seemed to arrive . after 90 minutes i hung my head in shame , knowing that i could never get that 90 minutes or $ 15.99 back . i literally almost cried as well , because if that was what could be considered `` comedy '' i did n't want to believe in movies anymore . my friend and i constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was . over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he did n't want to watch it alone . this was my next horrible mistake , because as i watched i just became angry . i began to yell at the movie , and i 'm not one to talk to movies period . everyone i know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they 've ever seen . my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends , but that could not save this movie even . the fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on imdb is astounding . the fact that its rating ( at the time of this writing ) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity .
this movie was long and boring . surprising that it was selected for cannes , although they tend to like pretentiousness . point is that contrary to other dutch stars of the arty genre like kerkhof and kruishoop , guernsey feels utterly empty . even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever . a long opening shot does n't mean cinematic depth , it 's just a long boring shot . the story was n't interesting and the characters had problems i could n't identify with at all . the actors did n't shine under her direction and seemed lost at times . leopold tried , but she is not the talent i hoped she would be . where are kerkhof and kruishoop ? they really made some waves in dutch cinema . leopold just made another attempt .
was it foreshadowing when tori complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot , and then her new boyfriend ( the murderer ) turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence ? i think so . scenes to make you squeal with delight : montages galore , a strip-tease in a kimono ( what do you call it when you seductively put clothes on , instead of take them off ? ) , and a climactic battle on skis ! definitely tune in for the beginning and end , but you can grab a sandwich during the second act when all the plot is happening . is it better than co-ed call girl ? nah . does tori ever make it to paradise , or out of the snow , even ? nope .
before stan laurel became the smaller half of the all-time greatest comedy team , he laboured under contract to broncho billy anderson in a series of cheapies , many of which were parodies of major hollywood features . following a dispute with anderson , laurel continued the informal series of parodies at joe rock 's smaller ( and more indigent ) production company . most of laurel 's parody films were only mildly funny at the time , and even less funny for modern audiences who have n't seen the original movie which laurel is parodying . 'west of hot dog ' is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shoot-'em-ups . it 's marginally a specific parody of 'west of the pecos ' , an oater released two years earlier with no major actors . since 'west of the pecos ' was never a huge success , it 's difficult to see why stan 's film unit chose this particular movie as a target for their lampoonery , much less why they waited so long after its release to parody it . and where did they get that title 'west of hot dog ' ? possibly it 's down to the fact that 'hot dog ! ' was a sexual interjection favoured by american lechers in the 1920s . ( as in the opening scene of the stage play 'machinal ' . ) 'west of hot dog ' was produced and co-directed by joe rock . among his many other achievements , rock introduced laurel to lois neilson , and he was subsequently best man at their wedding . full disclosure : in the last years of his life , i had the great privilege of befriending joe rock and interviewing him . nearly ninety years old at the time , rock 's memory was impressively clear ... but he remembered nothing at all about 'west of hot dog ' , and i ca n't blame him . this movie is eminently forgettable . the leading lady 's character is named little mustard : if that 's meant to be a parody of something in 'west of the pecos ' , i do n't get it . there are a couple of 'impossible ' gags here , including laurel 's method for mounting a horse . for just one moment in this movie , stan laurel reminded me of the great buster keaton when he suddenly broke into a run . 'west of hot dog ' is vaguely similar in subject matter and tone to keaton 's short comedy 'the frozen north ' , but keaton 's version is much funnier . the plot of this film somewhat anticipates a situation in keaton 's feature 'our hospitality ' but ( again ) suffers by comparison : here , two tough varmint brothers expect to inherit the last chance saloon , but the previous owner has bequeathed it to weakling tenderfoot stan . however , the brothers will become the legal heirs if stan dies . hmmm ... seriously , though : is such a bequest legal ? as soon as stan takes possession of the property , surely any further questions of ownership or inheritance become his decision , not the previous owner 's decision . i had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this dull comedy . at one point , a gag involves some crude animation drawn directly onto the film stock . it looks cheap and is n't funny . this 'hot dog ' is no weiner , and no winner : it 's just a whiner . my rating : one point out of 10 . hang on , stan : in a few more years you 'll be one-half of a comedy legend .
i saw brigadoon on tv last night ( 12 sept 2009 ) . i am 61 years old and have been watching films as long as i can remember . i can truthfully say that brigadoon stands alone as by far and away the worst film i have ever seen . the accents were shameful . the local children 's club would have produced better sets . the characters were so wooden that they probably contracted dry rot from the tears of the patrons who had the misfortune to watch them . it is to be hoped that the stars of this film had hides thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment which they must have suffered on seeing this film . the owners of this tripe should perform a great service to mankind and destroy all copies of this film .
i was dreading taking my nephews to this movie , as i did n't think it was going to be well done . the kids , ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it , so i caved . i must admit that it was not nearly as bad as i had thought , but was still a far cry from the book . the movie seemed right on with the 10 year old 's understanding and sense of humor . i found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place . i eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies do n't show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the `` silly '' or `` stupid '' choices .
i first saw this movie on mst3k . and although i laughed my posterior off at the jokes , i do n't particularly think this movie was all that bad . sure it was a little hard to understand it is quite obviously low budget , but it had a very hitchcock-like plot and i can honestly say that when i viewed the non-mst3k version , i was genuinely entertained . this movie is crying out for a hollywood remake .
i am a big fan of old horror movies , and since i am middle aged , old to me is a movie made before 1970 with most being made in the 1920 's to 1960 's period . i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies , with one exception being creepshow 1 , which i thought was great . i could reminisce about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook , and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending . all the stories were great though . so why did i like them so much ? the characters had some decent development , the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad , the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear , and the funny bits were really funny ! this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent ! i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb.com , lol . when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it 's telling you something ..... 4 of 10 . also , romero 's expertise is hard to find here , they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard ( i do n't know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me ) , and that 's not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on . it 's shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing ( yuck yuck ) to see it .
terrible use of scene cuts . all continuity is lost , either by awful scripting or lethargic direction . that villainous robot ... musta been a jazz dancer ? also , one of the worst sound tracks i 've ever heard ( monologues usually drowned out by music . ) and ... where 'd they get their props ? that ship looks like a milk carton ... i did better special effects on 8mm at the age of 13 ! i 'd recommend any film student should watch this flick ( 5 minutes at a time ) so as to learn how not to produce a film . or ... was it the editors ' fault ? it 's really too bad , because the scenario was actually a good concept ... just poorly executed all the way around . ( sorry malcom . you should have sent a `` stunt double '' . you 're too good an actor for such a stink-bomb . )
i watched this movie when i was a young lad full of raging hormones and it was about as sexy a movie as i had ever seen-or ever was to see . it may not have been a great movie . my guess is it was n't . i do n't really remember much about it , to tell you the truth . i only remember the sexual chemistry between crosby and biehn . no woman in any movie has ever done it for me as the unbelievably sexy cathy did in this movie . i have n't seen it since that first time i caught it on tv in the 70s and i do n't think i 'd want to see it again since i 'm sure it would be a disappointment-my hormones are n't as raging and i 've become more jaded over the years . still , when i think back on the shower scene i can still remember how great it felt way back when . added later : after watching the movie again , i discovered that it 's dangerous to go home again . what was once erotic is now pretty tame . the older woman-younger man thing still works for me , just not as much as it once did , probably because i 'm no longer a 12-year-old . that older woman is now younger than i am . also , the amateurishness of the whole thing was n't perceived by my twelve-year-old mind . moral : sometimes it 's better not to revisit the past .
if they could get ed asner why did n't they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers ? and why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger . it forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability . i guess thats why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work . if the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long-distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better . he has good reason to be jealous , good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective , controlling manipulative father . all the characters that are meant to be likable are n't and everyone else is the 'bad ' boyfriend . how did they meet anyway , a wine broker and a saw mill worker ?
the third installment of the `` carnosaur '' trilogy features a bunch of keystone kops-quality military commandos trying to kill two velociraptors and a t-rex . i give it a 4 out of sheer sympathy and my affinity for dinosaurs . the movie is definitely the worst of the trilogy , it really ca n't be taken seriously . more significantly , however , watching this movie i ca n't help but notice some interesting parallels between the `` carnosaur '' and `` xtro '' trilogies . the first installment in both franchises is a dark , disturbing film that has become a cult classic , the second is an `` alien '' ripoff , and the third is a tongue-in-cheek , almost slapstick ( whether intentional or not ) movie that has you rolling on the floor laughing . also , like the `` xtro '' franchise , all the `` carnosaur '' movies are completely unrelated to one another . they they only carry the franchise name to drum up interest in the `` sequels , '' i guess . obviously `` carnosaur '' and `` xtro '' have two different production groups at work here , but if you 've seen all three movies of both franchises you find yourself referring back and forth between the two .
nicolas roeg ? he directed the classic supernatural thriller don ` t look now didn ` t he ? strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on bbc television at the weekend which did tonight ` s screening of cold heaven no favours what so ever . you see it ` s impossible not to compare cold heaven with don ` t look now since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of cold heaven i thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been substituted instead of a dead child , in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around venice wearing a red anorak . this doesn ` t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there ` s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it ` s not explained in any great depth . in fact very little is explained in cold heaven which ruins the movie people have mentioned the rather poor production values of cold heaven and it ` s impossible not to notice them . if i didn ` t no different i would have thought this was a tvm since it ` s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence . roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesn ` t help the movie at all . one can ` t help feeling roeg should have put all his effort into the plot twists which are totally flat on screen cheap production values , disinterested directing and a really bizarre premise and screenplay make for a bad movie
before i begin , i want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved , including whittaker , who indeed deserves his nomination . it is highly entertaining , and . . . taken in the right context as a work of fiction , it is a very good movie . for that , i give it the two stars . however , rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere , i want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth . i stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character , dr. nicholas garrigan , is a complete invention of fiction . rather , it presents this character into a real historical setting , and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real , and what they are seeing is the truth . i have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction - but to do so in such a dishonest matter is , in a word , reprehensible . there can be no doubt that africa , along with most third world countries is rife with human misery and suffering . hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film . but hollywood also has its eye toward making money . the only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the west is to either experience it for yourself , or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary . but these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much . at the end of the day , they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself , and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming , `` see , we told you it was bad ! '' the seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the dvd after sitting through the movie . arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of kay amin , idi 's second wife , whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity . in the film , we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse ( arms for legs and vice-versa ) . this is the director making sure you understand that amin is , as the gungans say , bom-bad ! but watching the documentary , we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth , which the sitting minister of health at the time himself tells us is not true . so . . . what . . . they just make up these things ? why ? because hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence , that 's why ! they do n't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves . look , that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media - we do n't need this texas chainsaw massacre inspired imagery to reinforce that ! and this is just the tip of the iceberg . what is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character garrigan is himself fictional . there was no young scottish doctor taken under amin 's wing . as such , garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb westerners understand the african world . the producers seem to thing we wo n't be interested in a film about africa unless there is a white face in it . ( ironically , even the titular character is portrayed by an american black actor ! ) the problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of amin and his regime , but instead an exploitative thriller about a white westerner coming to africa for all the wrong reasons , making several horrible mistakes , and then `` redeeming '' himself , even at the cost of three other innocent lives . honestly , i have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of mrs. amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional scottish doctor - it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment ! i really wish hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money . i first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative a beautiful mind , ron howard and akiva goldsman 's sugary-sweet adaptation of the life of john nash , which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that america just ca n't get enough of . the sad truth is that hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years , and viewers , who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves , buy these fake portraits hook , line , and sinker . look , i 'm certainly not suggesting amin is being turned into a villain he was n't . my point is , with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man , why must hollywood then go to such fictional lengths ? why must hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films ? why can they not trust us to think for ourselves ! ? can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves ? i urge all who continue to watch hollywood 's purportedly `` true '' movies to do yourself the favor of always investigating for yourself , and to never assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth !
this is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze . kind of like billy jack i guess . however , whereas billy jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such . we are introduced to the star who is described as having learned judo in the marines . i was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing , i really do n't remember any emphasis on judo . as a result the antagonist , james macarthur , makes reference to the judo when he offers an excuse for why he , a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated . lame .
no , basically your watching something that does n't make sense . to not spoil the film for people who actually want to this take a look at the flick i will explain the story . a normal everyday to day women , is walking down a street then find 's herself driving by in her own car . she follows her and many events take place during that time that include her and her family . i specifically made an account to comment on this film , of how horribly written this was . the acting was great , the events were great , but the story just brought it nowhere - it could of been added to tremendously and be made into a worldwide epidemic . i 'm not sure what the writer was trying to accomplish by making this , usually at the end of films most of your questions get answers but this film has you asking , what just happened and 1 hour 20 minutes just passed for nothing . spoiler starts__ they had this area between 2 dimensions ( ours and behind the glass ) that would come into our world and kill us . it was not elaborated on all during the film , and you never know how it was happening or why it was or when it happened . nothing gets explained during the film . the main character should n't of even been the main character . at the end of the film the guy who finally figures it all out and runs away ( her sisters boyfriend ) should of been the main character but sadly the movie ends 20 seconds after . i bought this movie for $ 10 , threw it out right after .. do n't waste your time . i really hope nothing like this is made again .
allen goes to the country ( somewhere he hates going in real life ) and has a weekend with his friends - which are the usual successful white middle-class bellyaching types that feature in many of his films . i usually find something to amuse in woody allen comedies , but here he really falls totally flat on his face . even the one-liners seem to have deserted him . the really is no plot ( bar bits and pieces of cod shakespeare ) - but allen seems to use the location to allow a semi-mystical air , which just makes the thing even more witless and half-baked . it just does n't work at any level and is just a giant bore . the best thing about this film ( apart from the end credits coming up ) is that the bad reviews seem to get him to wake up and realise that simply throwing together a slapdash script and casting your mates in it does n't make for entertainment .
i got this in the dvd 10 pack curse of the dead . you got ta love those bargain packs . for even if they do n't feature true remastering , restoration and all that hoo-ha , and the films are generally in full-frame pan and scan format , there 's no denying that there are always a few gems included . and by `` gems '' , i mean there 's always some good crap to be seen , especially if the films are from the '70s as the mansion of madness is . my copy is called mansion of madness , but when the title screens roll it 's poe 's dr. tarr 's torture dungeon . does n't matter , really , as crap is crap is crap , no ? yes ! but saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all . there are some funky elements here and there , and obviously the flick did have a decent budget . the opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap tv look . the dialogue is always hilarious . near the beginning of the film , the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road . `` what strength ! '' says our hero . funny , then , that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun . you 'll completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end . that 's how memorable these characters are . the best part about mansion of madness , however , has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure . it 's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable . and why all the weirdo slapstick , anyway ? i 'd say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop . what the hell ? oh yeah , there 's plenty of boobies to be seen , too , for those of you that dig such things . boobies , bad dialogue , and wacky music . that best sums of mansion of madness for me . it 's well worth at least one viewing , and may be a lot better if you 've had a few to drink or whatnot . i ca n't say i was ever bored watching it , but i ca n't deny that it 's also a barrel of poop . kinda like magical mystery tour but with a plot , but not . hmm . and mr. chicken pwnz .
most of the episodes on season 1 are awful .. there is no comparison to twilight zone or outer limits , as they programs actually had decent story lines . most of amazing stories are well dull .. not amazing in the least .. go rent or buy the twilight zone series ... i have heard season 2 of this series is much better .. also for some reason on the dvd 's they cut out the ray walston parts which further diminishes this compilation . the one cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985 ... most of the story lines are very predictable though and the series could of been better with twists and turns that left you wondering ...
a propaganda film for the palestinian `` cause '' . if you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the israeli-palestinian conflict , you will need to look elsewhere . if you are an anti-semite ( or merely an anti-zionist -- -nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country , right ? ) or uncritically in support of palestinian goals ( e.g. , mass murder , the destruction of israel ) , this is the documentary for you . should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the uk and us . however , any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video . i just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation are n't corrupted by this anti-semitic filth .
absence of a good plot , absence of decent acting , absence of good cinematography , absence of decent looking special effects ... need i go on ? review may contain spoilers . the actors appear to be reading their lines , and not very well at that . most of the `` actors '' were acting like they were in a second grade play . the story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second graders ... it 's not really all that convoluted ... it 's just so simple and dumb , that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted . nope it 's not , it 's exactly as simple as you think it is . i understood the `` film '' , that 's how i know that it stunk ! most of the film just had people sitting around talking ( reading their lines ) , trying to look sinister . the narrator was annoying . the `` special effects '' were laughable . i love low budget movies . i also like carolyn munro , tom savini , jack scarry , and michael berrymore ... just not in this movie ... you can tell they were n't getting paid , or were n't getting paid much , because neither their hearts nor their talents were in it . i love tony todd ... however , he was only adequate in this movie . in fact , tony todd 's performance is the only reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 1 ... and tony was only in it for a whole two minutes ( seriously ) ! i would suggest to fast forward the dvd to the two minute tony todd segment . if i had gone to the theater , and paid more than a dollar to see this `` film '' i would have been p.o . 'd and demanded my money back . hopefully the people who made this will do better next time .
`` intensive care '' by dorna von rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made.this extremely cheap dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.a horror veteran george kennedy is completely wasted as as professor bruckner.the acting is abysmal , the action is slow and the climax is laughable.a famous surgeon has a car accident.he lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage . `` intensive care '' is clearly influenced by american slasher films including `` halloween '' and `` friday the 13th '' series.the killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid.still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look.you 'll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe me !
this absolute trash is based so closely on the friday the 13th series that is practically a carbon copy , accept for it being an australian film with people who ca n't act . once upon a time a young boy got burnt up accidentally during the filming of a music video at lake eildon . now , a number of years later , the boy is all grown up and taking revenge on anybody who comes to the lake to film a music video . it is cliche-ridden and a waste of time and money , see it only out of curiosity , or if you 're an aspiring actor trying to learn how not to ( not be able to ) act . lead role alan dale used to star in the television soap opera neighbours , but ended up in the x files - how did that happen ?
an innocent man ( steve guttenberg ) has a one-night stand with his boss 's wife ( isabelle huppert ) . she spots a woman ( elizabeth mcgovern ) being attacked outside but she ca n't call the cops because it would blow her marriage to gutenberg 's boss ( paul shenar ) . so guttenberg , honest citizen that he is , when he discovers that another woman was attacked and killed nearby only half an hour later , comes forward and claims to have witnessed the first attack , merely intending to pass on the information given to him by huppert . well -- never bear false witness against thy neighbor , as they say . this simple attempt to help the police nab a murderer turns rapidly twisted . when he meets the first near-victim , mcgovern , she immediately twigs to what happened , but agrees to keep quiet for the moment . but then guttenberg finds himself in court , supposed to identify the heavy ( greenquist ) and we discover through cross-examination that he is near-sighted and ca n't identify objects at a distance , let alone faces . ( not that it matters because , after all , he never saw the creep in the first place . ) the plot gets practically labyrinthine . guttenberg winds up the chief suspect when huppert is murdered too . he barely escapes arrest and holes up with the now-sympathetic mcgovern . guttenberg and mcgovern hatch a plan to trap the murderer . she will serve as bait . they 'll follow the flagitious creep into one of his seedy haunt and mcgovern will act like the doxy that the murderer is attracted to , just to get him to try to kill her . but everything will be okay , see , because not only will guttenberg keep a close watch on her , and not only will he alert the police a few minutes after she enters this dive , but she will keep a can of mace handy -- just in case . i ask you , the alert viewer , does this scenario unfold as planned ? elizabeth mcgovern has a quirkily interesting bone structure . she seems all mandible and tiny mouth at times , but she 's vibrant . steve guttenberg has hair on his brawn and that 's about it . otherwise he 's as helpless as the character he plays . if isabelle huppert can act , it is n't evident in this film . the killer is so formed and so groomed that he looks like he 's wearing one of those masks of deformity in that twilight zone episode about greedy heirs . did n't the director , curtis hanson , go on to make `` l.a . confidential '' ? that was a nicely done piece of work . here , everything seems clumsy and contrived , down to the small bit parts . just before the inevitable violent climax , a uniformed police officer is introduced to delay mcgovern 's rescue , and the scene is embarrassing to watch . dick olsen has a bit part as a late shopper . he 's a neat guy and always reliable . paul shenar as the cuckolded hubby has a striking face that seems made for the stage and he does a fine job too . that louche joint where mcgovern attracts the attention of the murderer , where she plays pool with a couple of hairy apes , was shot at a bar in carolina beach , in north carolina , not far from where i lived . the way the interior is set up , it 's clear that this is supposed to be a dangerous and dirty dive . actually it appears rather more elegant on screen than it did in reality . overall , this is hitchcock territory and it brings tears to the eyes to imagine what he would have done with this story .
this film 's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the dvd . however , the resulting movie is absolutely dire ! admittedly , this is not the worst film ever made , or the worst film this year , but it came damn close ! the main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be : comedy , adult drama , thriller , teen-porn ? the story is interesting , as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides , but the film is a mess . what starts out as a mildly interesting `` comedy '' ( a word i use in the loosest possible terms ) , then goes totally in reverse , and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller . nicole kidman should know better , and ben chaplin is wasted ! as are matthieu kassovitz and vincent cassel , whom i can only presume did this for the money . this is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect . it 's not funny , it 's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive benny hill for everything he did , and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty . a film to be avoided , unless you absolutely have to see kidman or chaplin in every one of their films !
a woman ( sylvia kristel ) seduces a 15 year old boy ( eric brown ) . they have sex ... but it 's all tied into some stupid plot or something . easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever . does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation ? i suppose it 's ok cause it 's a teenage boy -- if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would ( rightfully ) be outrage . sorry , but having it done to a boy does n't excuse it . it 's still sick . i realize brown was of age ( he was actually 18 when this was made ) but he looks 15 . i just find it disturbing that some people find this ok . plot aside the acting sucks ( kristel is beautiful -- but ca n't act ; brown is easily one of the worst child actors i 've ever seen ) and the constant nudity gets boring and is n't even remotely erotic . i saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981 . i was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin ( who could easily pass for 18 ) . he wanted to see it -- i did n't but i decided what the heck ? we got in and i actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage . my cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through ! let me make this clear -- three teenage boys left a movie with tons of female nudity ! that should give you an idea of how bad this is . i 'm surprised this was ever released . a 1 all the way .
that 's right , you heard me . i am a huge fan of james patterson . i own 10 of his books , and i have read the entire series about lindsey boxer . in my opinion , the screenwriter should be shot . what right did any film maker have to slaughter a terrific work of fiction and make it into a mockery of the mystery genre ? if i ever thought that harry potter was butchered , then michael o'hara has proved me wrong . i can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice . to michael o'hara and russell mulcahy : do n't quit your day job .
i have just watched the movie for the first time . i wanted to watch it as i like drew barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies . the movie is about a girl ( played by young and beautiful drew barrymore ) , who moves from nyc to la in order to get over her recently troubled loss . short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her , it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin=doppelganger , who haunts her . the movie is quite poor and lousy . both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it . summing up it is just something for the fans of drew barrymore .
ascension is actually a step up in terms of what the original movie was in story and in special effects . jason scott lee is good as a vampire hunter looking for the count himself ( if you remember him , he was from the movie dragon , the bruce lee story . ' ) jason london is funny as luke , the kid who helps the woman he loves from a far steal dracula 's body from the slab . diane neal is good as the woman who steals dracula 's body in order to finds a cure for her dying boyfriend , and stephen billington is great as dracula himself . giving a better performance than gerard butler did the count in the original film . roy scheider rounds out the rest of the cast in this movie , and he does a decent job as the mentor of jason scott lee 's character . this is the second sequel in the trilogy , and they are off to a good start . it 's up in the air whether the last film will close the series out on a good note .
the japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy movies . they have always been ready to destroy cities by huge plastic monsters coming from outer space and elsewhere . the problem is they have never had the money to succeed in making convincing special effects . this film , released in france under the title les envahisseurs de l'espace , is no exception . its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant octopus to the giant lobster trying to have the upper hand on the humans . it 's extremely awkward and laughable , but well quite enjoyable too . after all , we do like these creatures and these films after all , do n't we ?
this is my first movie review on imdb . i was forced to register after watching this movie . i can not in good conscience allow this movie to be unreviewed by me . the people must be warned ! first of all , my rating is : 0 ( as in `` zero '' ) i love jack black , ben stiller , rachel weis , and christopher walken , and yet , i hated this movie . there is a plot , but who cares when there 's no script . the dialogue is unreal and plain boring , the situations are contrived , the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary , the characters are unsympathetic and uninteresting , and the story , although based on a good premise , is stupid . this movie is a piece of poo . never mind wasting money on this movie , it 's not even worth your time spent watching it . please do not see it ... i beg of you !
no likeable characters ( the lead is a combination of the worst of woody allen/paul provensa/reiser ) and the contrived scenes ( did anyone really think thiat kid on the rollerblades was not going to knock the guy down ? ) were just sickeningly bad .
visually cluttered , plot less , incredibly mind-numbing rubbish . not even close to greenaway 's better work . avoid at all costs ! the overlapping 'split screen ' effects do nothing more than confuse , the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the 'artistic ' composing of images is pretentious in the extreme . there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film ; even the nudity is incredibly unerotic , which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring . plus , how anyone can say that the acting of ewen macgregor is brilliant is beyond me . he showed more ability in the star wars series , and that 's saying something . i 've not been so unimpressed with a film since i saw 'darby o'gill and the little people ' !
i enjoyed the previous ittenbach movie that i 'd seen , `` burning moon '' . but while that movie was rather grim and nasty , `` premutos '' seems to mostly play it for laughs . while its admirable how ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time ( and the dvd documentary is worthwhile to see this ) , i found myself constantly battling not to fast-forward to the next gore scene . sure , there 's gore , and if that 's all you want then go ahead and enjoy . but be warned : there 's an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition . many are comparing this to peter jackson 's movies , especially `` braindead '' . but looking at what jackson did on a similar budget in `` bad taste '' , it 's clear ittenbach is lacking one thing that jackson has - talent . 3/10 ( for pretty good and plentiful gore effects , and for getting the most out of limited resources - but not worth the money i paid for it )
one of the worst movies i ever saw . my only thought was : `` how can i get my money back from hollywood video '' . this is no way worth four dollars , or any dollars . i think it was an attempt to rip off the mexican , or vin diesel 's movies , but it failed miserably to do this . the acting was terrible , i felt sorry for the actors that they could n't find something better to do with their time . the story was ridiculous . we were calling out the lines ahead of the actors , it was so predictable . the mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated , worse than a cartoon . skip it .
being born in the 1960 's i grew up watching the tv `` movies of the week '' in the early 70 's and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including `` crowhaven farm '' , `` bad ronald '' , `` satan 's school for girls '' , `` kolchak the night stalker '' , etc , but this one is just plain dumb.this is obviously the writer 's trying to capitalize on the horrific manson murders from a few years earlier . the movie stars dennis weaver of `` mccloud '' and `` duel '' fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach . the family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family . the reason for this is never explained , and weaver 's pacifistic stance is hard to swallow . for god 's sake , call the police , beat the hell of them or something , just do n't sit there and whine about it . the acting is pretty lame , the story unbelievable , etc . susan dey looks cute in a bikini but that 's about it . ignore this if it ever airs on tv .
sexo cannibal , or devil hunter as it 's more commonly known amongst english speaking audiences , starts with actress & model laura crawford ( ursula buchfellner as ursula fellner ) checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant jane ( gisela hahn ) . after a long days work laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character 's named chris ( werner pochath ) & thomas ( antonio mayans ) burst in & kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous jane . laura 's agent gets on the blower to rent-a-hero peter weston ( al cliver ) who is informed of the situation , the kidnappers have laura on an isolated island & are demanding a 6 million ransom . peter is told that he will be paid 200,000 to get her back safely & a further 10 % of the 6 million if he brings that back as well , faster than a rat up a drain pipe peter & his vietnam vet buddy helicopter pilot jack are on the island & deciding on how to save laura . so , the kidnappers have laura & peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much . just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe ( hell , in all the generations they 've lived there they 've only managed to build one straw hut , now that 's primitive ) who worship some cannibal monster dude ( burt altman ) with bulging eyes as a god with human sacrifices & this cannibal has a liking for young , white female flesh & intestines ... this spanish , french & german co-production was co-written & directed by the prolific jesus franco who also gets the credit for the music as well . sexo cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the uk as it was placed on the 'video nasties ' list in the early 80 's under it 's alternate devil hunter title & therefore officially classed as obscene & banned , having said that i have no idea why as it is one bad film & even franco , who is n't afraid to be associated with a turkey , decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of clifford brown . i 'd imagine even the most die-hard franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing . the script by franco , erm sorry i mean clifford brown & julian esteban as julius valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product & wanted his named removed , is awful . it 's as simple & straight forward as that . for a start the film is so boring it 's untrue , the kidnap plot is one of the dullest i 've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved & the horror side of things do n't improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over-sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes . as a horror film sexo cannibal fails & as an action adventure it has no more success , this is one to avoid . director franco shows his usual incompetence throughout , a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try & give the impression it 's not attached to anything ! the cannibal scenes are poor , the action is lame & it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from ' a ' to ' b ' & not really doing anything when they get there either . it becomes incredibly dull & tedious to watch after about 10 minutes & do n't forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it 's uncut state . i also must mention the hilarious scene when al cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff , this is achieved by franco turning his camera on it 's side & having cliver crawl along the floor ! just look at the way his coat hangs & the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along ! the gore is n't that great & as far as euro cannibal films go this is very tame , there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat , a man is impaled on spikes , there 's some blood & a handful of intestines . there 's a fair bit of nudity in sexo cannibal & an unpleasant rape scene . sexo cannibal must have had a low budget & i mean low . this is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects & rock bottom production values . the only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic . the music sucks & sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen . the acting sucks , the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act . sexo cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell . the only good things i can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it & those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross . anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give sexo cannibal as wide a berth as possible , one to avoid .
i would n't give this movie a rating , it 's not worthy . i watched it only because i 'm a pfieffer fan . i love her and would watch anything she made . even in this dud , she did n't disappoint . every scene with her in it , kept the viewer watching ... waiting ... for something to happen but nothing ever did . it had some good story lines but they ended abruptly as soon as it started . some of the other characters had potential but nothing became of it . pfieffer was 29 when she made this film and at her most lovely . the wardrobe and set was surprisingly good . i can watch mostly anything and rarely come across a movie i ca n't find something to like about it , but this was a dud . i do n't understand . the worst thing about it all , it had a big cliff hanger at the end . it had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow , this film is finally going some place , then the credits roll . good grief . i agree with the review that said .99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting . well said . actually , that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well . i too wasted .99 cents on this dud.dud.dud .
this italian semi-horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good , that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes . the only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film . the story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon , go berserk and seemingly kill them . they show the nudity , but they never really show the murders at this point in the film . then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her . he has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife evelyn was also one , she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience 's business . after a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes , foxes and such . at this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely . this movie just did not work for me , it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film . explaining evelyn 's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where evelyn did rise from the grave . granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave , just not under her own power . the gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too . i just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull .
i 'll bet none of you knew that the famous conquistador hernando cortes made a preliminary scouting expedition to mexico before taking on the aztecs . good thing he did because he would never have known about those t rexs that inhabited one particular valley where the locals revered them as gods . that was understandable . what was n't was the casting of blue eyed ian ziering as cortes . even with the blond hair made famous in beverly hills 90210 dyed black , ian looked positively ridiculous . at least he made no attempt at a spanish accent . the real hero of tyrannosaurus azteca is marco sanchez also late of a television series with a semi-recurring role in walker texas ranger as detective sandoval of the dallas pd . he finds true love with an aztec princess and life would be just perfect if it was n't for those pesky prehistoric beasts the natives worship . tyrannosaurus azteca looks like they used some outtakes from the famous sid & marty krofft series the land of the lost . all that was needed was some sleestak to appear . if you 're interested in finding out about this reconnoitering expedition that did n't quite make the history books by all means check out tyrannosaurus azteca . then try and sit through it with a straight face .
the words `` swedish '' and `` action movie '' do not mix . that becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre . this is yet another failed attempt . lasse brunell ( shanti roney ) works at a military air base with top secret computer systems . one day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he does n't do what they tell him . they want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it . this movie has it 's ups and downs . and usually in swedish action movies there are no `` ups '' , just `` downs '' . so i guess something in this movie showed some quality . to begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made . the footage of planes and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice . the acting is of very varying quality . shanti roney makes a decent performance while maria bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual ( i wonder how long swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank ? ) . stefan sauk is laughable as the `` cool '' special forces man who comes to the base to investigate . and what about the action scenes ? well as i said above the scenes of planes and helicopters flying are nice . but aside from that there is not much action to talk about . and that is a common problem with swedish action films . there is just not enough action going on . maybe it 's a budget problem , maybe it 's film-making culture . i do n't know , but it negatively affects the experience . because quite frankly , the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on that . i rate this 4/10 for effort .
i have been watching horror movies since i was 5 years old , beginning with childs play.since then , i have seen good horror movies and bad , but this is without question , the dumbest movie i have ever seen ! the actors did all they could with the material . the plot was just idiotic . plus , it was just all gore . i can stomach a lot of blood , but that was just ridiculous ! in one of the scenes , a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines ! plain stupid ! another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made . the end of it is just dumb . but then again , it goes with the rest of it ! at the end , when the girl gets away from the cannibal/ancestor , she receives help from a old lady . the old lady is making tea , but when she turns around to talk to the girl , the girl attacks her ! she turned into a cannibal ! retarded movie .
predictable , told a thousand times story with the usual drama in between , a couple of pretty raunchy sex scenes intermingled with some character paranoia , 70 's style incidental violin horror music that is comical at times , i could n't help chuckling to myself . i usually like defoe , and it has to be said that the acting is not all that bad , the `` plot '' develops at a reasonable pace and does keep you guessing from time to time . its just that it 's all too predictable , i felt like i was watching a made for tv drama instead of a new movie . maybe thats the style the directors wanted , but it has to be said that the review i read on here before i saw the movie could only have been written by someone involved in its production . do n't expect too much , and if i could wind the clock back i would n't have gone to see it at the cinema . i would wait for the bargain bins at your video shop , i 'm sure it wont take long .
sort of family parody blending `` an officer and a gentleman '' , `` heartbreak ridge '' , `` full metal jacket '' ( and without doubt other movies i am not able to remember now ) into a rather dull movie , with some bright spots . the gags are always there where you would expect them , and damon wayans 's lines are , well , predictable . as i said , unfortunately this movie never surprises you ...
the problems with this film are many , but i will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones . first of all , while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about manhattan life , the reality was that everything , as usual in movies and tv , was about something bizarre , usually of a sexual nature . the story lines were thin or nonexistent , and virtually every scene , camera shot , line of dialog , and expressed emotion was absolutely , and totally fake . it finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that i walked out ( something no uncommon for me in recent years . ) i would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program , but i believe the ( at one time , pre-amelia , talented ) director mira nair took part in this disgusting travesty , so perhaps the directorial talent in america has descended en masse into the cesspool .
this movie stinks . the stench resembles bad cowpies that sat in the sun too long . i ca n't believe that so many talented actors wasted their time making such a hopelessly awful film . whew !
this was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies i 've seen in a very long time . i 've never liked spike lee , but thought i 'd give this one a try : bad mistake . the movie is supposed to show how the son of sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977 ; what it really did was center around the most boring characters that i doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems , marriage problems , and so on , etc . the scenes that depict the murders are just that , and nothing more ; a shooting and then it 's back to saturday night fever ! what 's even more ridiculous is spike lee 's choice to show up as a reporter in the movie : spike , trust me , you 're no hitchcock , stay out of the movies , it makes them even worse off . the most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice , which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot ? ? ? spike , what were you thinking when you made this film ? not thinking at all is my guess . people who think they 'll see a crime drama , take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser . you 're better off watching jerry springer in this case ! waste of film , i gave it a 1 out of 10 : awful dud .
tedious girls-at-reform-school flick , which plays somewhat like a prison movie . chris ( linda blair ) is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father . once in the de facto jail , she is gang raped by her fellow female `` inmates '' . overlong ( even at 98 minutes ) , with an utterly pointless ending which makes the entire film seem pointless . 15 year old linda blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed , but lets a nipple shot slip during a shower scene . * 1/2 out of * * * *
i have to admit i 've caught this one a few times on the usa network . there 's just something about the , well , sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it 's on . yes , you 're right about the sub-par acting , the plot which only an seven year old could like , etc . but i ca n't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors . then again , a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel .
with no fault to the actors ( they all put on great performances ) , the overall story was not very well executed . the movie opens with a great zinger : a crazy old guy forces a young aborigine girl 's car off the road . but then , we 're forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with an entirely new group of characters ... and we do n't know why until the 40 minutes are up . it turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl 's body ... and the story progresses from there . while the story does pick up at that point , it really goes nowhere . after 2 hours , i asked myself : was there a point to this , or was it just to see the characters struggle with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery ? the story was ultimately unsatisfying and felt unfinished . while it is well acted , there 's not a strong enough backbone in the film to warrant recommending it .
i 'll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography . otherwise , it teems mainly with clichés and stereotypes : mountain people are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious or ragged racist kind , or wise white indians . indians are magical people who move around without a sound , can disappear in the blink of an eye , talk to animals , and read minds over large distances . and so on and so forth . throughout the movie i kept wondering what the point of the film was ( other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains , log cabins , woods , an assortment of animals , free-spirited mountain-dwellers and freaky people in church ) . the plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth . this was neither a story about growing up during the depression , nor about about being an orphan , nor about a struggle for identity . it tried to be all of those things and more , which made it superficial and unsatisfactory . although the movie was supposed to be about little tree 's education , we learn almost nothing about it . he was given a brief summary of the history of his people ( who were brave and stoic ) and a distillery demonstration ; tried his hand at chopping wood ( at which he failed ) and whiskey running ( literally ) ; learned how to read ( and maybe to write ) with the help of grandma and her dictionary - and that was it . apparently he did n't learn much during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the attic . however , grandma and grandpa and graham greene 's character made sure that in the end little tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - after , and i 'm paraphrasing here , `` riding with the navajos '' and `` getting caught up in a couple of wars '' - was to `` catch up '' with grandma and grandpa and graham greene 's character in heaven ( instead of , say , dating girls , getting married , having children or other such nonsense ) . last but not least i must say that i found grandpa 's trade offensive . why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still ? to counteract the stereotype of the `` drunken indian '' ?
what was the purpose of this film ? i suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a big payday for doing nothing . even my favorite actor , bruce dern , could n't keep my interest in this boring movie . a braindead ex-pugilist falls in with a weird woman and her relatives . he starts out as a fix-it man for the woman , and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme . it was so confusing i ca n't even write a decent critique . if you see this one , my sweet , make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep .
for anyone that loves predictable movies with an awful soundtrack , lack of dialogue , clichés up the wazoo , and also stereotypes that just happens to be typical of an american film , look no farther . dreamworks whether wanted to save money on acquiring voice talent , or really wanted to create an animated episode of national geographic ; either way , they succeeded in delivering a rather bland and boring movie . spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a bore fest that sends mixed signals to kids and adults , and also fails to entertain despite the oh-so-cutesy theme of animals triumphing over humans . after looking past the wonderful animations , what you have remaining is nothing but a big mess . spirit is about a stallion that from the beginning of the film looks like quite a handful , as he is a horse that can not be tamed , calmed , nor controlled . because of this , he rises and becomes the leader of his group of high-spirited horses , which includes his mom . but , his life of freedom and running around comes to an abrupt halt as he is captured by a group of americans in the process of connecting the wild west with the rest of the country . during this , spirit ( never actually named that throughout the entire film almost ) befriends a courageous native american , and a fellow female horse , and also has a lot of run-ins with the cynical and cruel army folks that apparently do n't believe in giving up . why must movies mix computer animation with traditional ? it comes off looking rather meshed , something spirited away suffered from as well . best example is when a train is chasing after spirit ; you see the hand-drawn spirit running from a computer-animated train . it would look much better if it were one or the other , but not both ; unless you can really pull off some nice effects . beauty and the beast 's famous dance sequence uses computer animation , but it is nowhere near as obvious as the train or the snow in this movie . the opening sequence was the best-looking part of the film , kind of sad to see the rest of the movie slide a bit downhill in terms of quality . a little scene has multiple ; i mean multiple similar shots of just a general 's face , quite repetitive and annoying in my opinion . the kids might enjoy this flick , but with lack of dialog , song , and motivation , it might be a perfect technique in making hyper children fall asleep . while disney becomes criticized for its animated musicals , they wind up becoming much more entertaining than a more realistic approach to telling a story like this one . bryan adams has no place in this movie , and why does hans zimmer stay away from using a western theme in this movie , when it is a story taking place in the old west ? soundtrack sounds a bit off if you ask me . at least they are using realistic noises of horses , two points for that . yet , if you are going to refrain from making horses talk , why even have a narrator interrupt every so often , which just so happens to be the main character himself ? native americans are nice , and the western folks are evil , native-killing , horse torturing , rowdy , psychopathic monsters that must be destroyed . more or less , this is what spirit is showing us . it reaches a point in which they are trying so hard for the viewers to hate the travelers of the wild west ; they even had a scene of several horses pulling a huge train up a hill , and another scene of them destroying an entire village of natives . now , the person spirit befriended happened to betray him , on more than one occasion , yet that is forgivable , apparently because he is not a soldier ; that or because he has the sassy female horse . spirit is n't exactly a victim we should feel sorry for ; the viewer is supposed to sympathize with spirit despite him putting his entire group of horses at risk , wreaking havoc , and even perhaps resulting in some off-screen deaths that are quickly shoved aside because oh no , spirit is in trouble ! this film gets quite rhythmic , as we see in multiple instances spirit escaping from chains , kicking people around , destroying property , freeing horses , and then getting captured again -- -all in this same order too . the writers also seem to have an obsession with cliffs because they are sprinkled all over the movie ; for an old west film , they certainly have very little room to roam . bottom line : this is most certainly no disney movie , as a matter of fact that is a bad thing , even though it was what they were aiming for . so , instead of the typical musical , we get a boring film that becomes predictable , dull and slow in multiple instances . even the decent animation becomes inconsistent when the computer work gets thrown in . everything about this movie was just wrong ; from the ideals that back then americans that were not native were evil buffoons , to the soundtrack and musical score that just seemed so far off . kill bill vol . 2 , which pretty much has nothing to do with the old west , has more of a western feel than this movie . do yourselves a favor and totally skip this by all means necessary . thank you .
my friends and i rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile . the movie is not supposed to be funny at all , but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever . first , phillippe ( i forget what his character is called and i do n't really care ) uses his regular employee id to go through all the top-security terminals . not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts culminate in his finding the so-scary lego-room , which hosts the super computers . this is plain funny . the tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely spoilt by the childish looking room . the ending , like all else , is very very very cheesy , especially when the bad guy 's lawyer shows up 'right on time ' . anyway , this movie is a good laugh . if you need something to make fun of , definitely see it .
this movie is probably the worst i have seen . bad acting , bad script , bad everything . comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting . both cyborg ( van damme , 1989 ) and nemesis ( olivier gruner , 1993 ) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it 's albert pyun who has directed these two as well ! the story is not original . the world has become a terrible place , possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war , and people live under medieval circumstances . a special breed of robots ( cyborgs ) live on human blood and there 's the story ... the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there `` prophecy '' and the humans need someone to stop them . one girl together with a robot ( kris kristofferson ) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind . in this movie the director tries some hong-kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far . the movie fails miserably in this attempt . i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new `` worst ever '' movie to relate to . and to fans of the genre i recommend `` cyborg '' since i think it 's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor . and if you ca n't stand van damme then check out `` nemesis '' . i rated this movie 1/10 .
well ... now that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his `` house of 1,000 corpses '' crapfest , i can now rest in peace . nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in `` the house of seven corpses , '' but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot ( ha ! ) anyway , to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode ! in hell house ( sorry , i do n't remember the actual name of the residence ) , a bunch of mysterious , unexplained deaths took place long ago ; some , like arthritic lurch stand-in john carradine ( whose small role provides the film 's only worthwhile moments ) , attribute it to the supernatural ; bellowing film director john ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum . the result comes across like `` satan 's school for girls '' ( catchy title ; made-for-tv production values ; intriguing plot ) crossed with `` children should n't play with dead things '' ( low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead ) ; trouble is , it 's nowhere near as entertaining or fun . `` the house of seven corpses '' is dead at frame one , and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis , dragging us along for every aching second ...
i 've read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict , british school in the 1960 's to understand this . maybe that 's true , if so , then this movie is outdated . * * * * * * * * * * * * * spoiler alert * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the ending makes about as much sense as all the kids who 're anti-government and anti-corporation without having any better solution that does n't torch society to a mad max type cinder . yeah , the main characters could leave , but they do n't . the reasons they go about this do n't make sense . there is n't enough character development to explain why . what shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at . it is mentioned that war is the final creative expression , quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have , and it makes no sense . the characters who go on a murder spree are n't fighting the institution , they 're just killing people . i thought they might 've used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end , that would 've made greater symbolic sense , but they did n't . tl ; dr - this movie is an adolescent 's daydream of fighting against authority that plagues them , though in reality they need . it has no moral , symbolic truth , or meaning to it ; this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in `` power '' that annoy you . if you think a murder rampage/ school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you do n't like , then i guess you 'll love this movie . if you 're like me and you 're working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly ( very blindly in this movie ) rebelling against `` the man '' , this movie is juvenile and boring . you can also tell in parts that funding was lacking , and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder . all in all , this seems like a very rough draft of what could 've been an okay movie , but no effort is put into the dialogue , character development , or moral so it 's just ... poorly done . if ... only i could get my two hours back .
written by the excellent mcgovern and directed by frears this film was a slight disappointment . it seemed too short . it spent far too long creating the hovis atmosphere , and laughing at the catholic demands . then very quickly you have the fascist and socialists vying for the family 's attention , and the terrible conclusion . still my wife thought liam was cute .
overrated and only for those people in their 20 's whom wear particularly thick rose tinted glasses , who never actually saw it in the first place because they were to young . awful animation , dialogue and a tired narrative . a real product of the 80 's , the novel gimmick of a puzzle toy ( thats right , toy not the absurd , pretentious and child alienating `` collectors action figurine '' ) , sold on the back of a poor cartoon and other paraphernalia , only matters to those who bought the toy when they were `` actual '' children in the period of '84 ' to '87 ' . it has become cult because of those same adults are to immature to let go of their memories . avoid .
that 's what the title should be , anyway . this movie combines guns , explosives , and mindless killing to make one flop of an `` action '' movie . let me make my point in a series of questions : answers type deal . what happens in the movie ? people die . is that it ? yes . what is the plot about ? what plot ? what is the point the movie is trying to make ? killing is the only solution . what are the characters like ? extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities . is there anything good about this movie ? yes . i 'm sure they used some nice panavision cameras in filming it . if you like constant killing and greed , then watch the movie . if you happen to be repulsed by such low-standard `` entertainment '' , then `` made men '' is not for you . to sum it up , the plotline stinks , the characters are n't worth their while , the storyline is completely resistable , and nothing fits together . this proves one thing : the actors , directors , and whoever helped make this movie certainly are n't `` made '' .
man to man tries hard to be a good movie : it has its heart at the right place , it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate . but there lies also some of the problems of this picture . it strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged . so it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic - man to man does n't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head . joseph fiennes exemplifies this in his role : he does his best to look concerned , genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer . add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that man to man is not worth watching . but there are enough points to defend it : it is entertaining , has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing kristin scott thomas . of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like the elephant man ( david lynch ) but you 'll be leaving the theatre satisfied . it tries to grab your heart ( even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious ) and succeeds most of the time .
this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen ... it is humorous how bad it is .. the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancing .. ( i 've seen porno 's with a better plot ) when the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away . but as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it is n't going to do anything compared to if you watch it .. i do n't recommend renting it but if it comes on tv watch it for about 30min just to see what i mean . i could n't watch more than 30min but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good willpower
with the massive advertising this is getting on nickelodeon and nick jr. and that ilk , my son was bugging us to see it . between dvd and the theaters , i 've seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding ( incredibles , shrek ) to the really bad ( wall-e , brother bear ) . but this was easily the worst movie i 've ever seen , kids or no kids . it was a `` when it this stupid thing going to end ? '' kind of experience ? ok , it 's aimed at toddlers ( or it better be - it 's insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3 ) , but i 've never seen something so predictable , repetitive , and slow-moving . then once you 're finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over , there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke , but there is n't one - it 's serious , though it 's hard to tell what they 're trying to accomplish . the 3-d effects ... yeah , if you 've never seen a viewmaster they 're a big deal , otherwise no ( if you look at the screen without glasses , it appears to be the same process ) . even my son was bored by the end . both my wife and i looked at each other and said `` wow '' at the end . bad in every respect .
there was not one single redeeming factor in this movie . the girlfriend and i both love action films . especially fight scenes ( bloodsport and kickboxer was awesome ) , but this movie was not entertaining . five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and `` angry '' facial expressions . the main hero is a troubled character who has seen battle and thus is forced to look seriously constipated at all times . the army has disrupted his bowel movements on top of perfecting his fighting technique . the music is n't good either . they fight to the rap and hip-hop style of the streets , 'cause these guys are thugs . the rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise to low-budget dramas . everything about this movie is classic b-style . the actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left burning in some rotten hollywood alleyway . the film is called `` honor , '' but there was no honor in making this film . it was simply a waste of money , and spending wisely is something i consider to be honorable . go see felon instead . the fight scenes and situations are more real .
wonderful cast wasted on worthless script . ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as juveniles . could this ever happen in a million years ? it 's simply a fantasy , and a boring one at that . do they become teenagers again ? do they reenact their pranks , games , good times ? they may try but ultimately the answer is : no . is there any intrigue ? any suspense ? horror ? comedy ? none of the above . how anyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me . i wanted to like this movie ; i tried to like this movie , but my brain refused .
from the critical acclaim , i expected more from this movie and from tamara jenkins . the story just meandered along and did n't seem to have a point or a plot . and i find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl ( mature for her age or no ) would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity `` over with . '' maybe i am too young to relate ( i was four years old in 1976 ) , but i did n't have any problems connecting with the stories of shakespeare in love or life is beautiful and i was n't alive for either of those settings . the cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience . overall , slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks , i would say skip this one .
very bad film . very , very , very bad film . it 's a rarity , but it defenitly is not worth hunting down . this italian jaws rip-off makes little sense most of the time , and no sense the rest . the `` alligator '' is not at all convincing , and many of the sub-plots go nowhere . if it 's at the local video store , you may want to watch it if you 're a fan of monster movies , but it 's not worth hunting down .
neat premise . very unrealistic . what i learned from this movie is that speeding crazily out of control to go to the weekend cabin may not be the best idea after all . i loved how bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill with no injury at all ! unfortunately , the same ca n't be said for his gal . oh , and the police never seemed to find the car or trace the owner of the wreck . lots of dragged out scenes including a plain stripper ( still have nightmares from that scene ) . poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand . i admit i was intrigued to see what the mysterious `` thing '' was behind the door , but when it appeared , i just laughed . ha ha ha ! ! the girl really seemed sadistically angry about being revived . personally , i really would want a new body after an excruciating experience like that !
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnn ! : =8o zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... < =8 . oh , um excuse me , sorry , fell asleep there for a mooment . now where was i ? oh yes , `` the projected man '' , yes ... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... < =8 . ooops , sorry . yes , `` the projected man '' . well , it 's a british sci-fi yawnfest about nothing . some orange-headed guy projects himself on a laser , gets the touch of death . at last he vanishes , the end . actually , the film 's not even that interesting . dull , droning , starchy , stiff , and back-breakingly boring , `` the projected man '' is 77 solid minutes of nothing , starring nobody . dull as dishwater . dull as doorknob dust . dull as ethan hawke - we 're talking really dull here , people ! but wait , in respect to our dull cousins from across the puddle , the moocow will now do a proper review for `` the projected man '' : zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz .............. < =8 .
this movie barely followed the story line of the movie . all of the fascinating points in the book did n't even exist in the movie . they ended up turning it into a cheesy `` tween '' disney movie `` crush '' story between meg and calvin . it was so bad it should have been hillary duff playing the part , or one of the likes . this movie was nothing more than an insult to the intelligence and mysticism of the book . i ca n't believe disney could even get away with making such a cheap , basic rendition . if you 've ever read the book , i think you would agree it could easily be made into a movie of `` lord of the rings '' equivalence . this movie should have never been able to use the title of a wrinkle in time . poorly done .
you 'd better choose paul verhoeven 's even if you have watched it .
what the f * @ # was this i just watched ? steven stop ! ! please ! this movie is insatiably bad and silly . in a bizarre departure from action and adventure , mr. seagal is now fighting ( obviously ) wish-they-were-vampire 'like ' creatures with super human strength. ? ok ? oh , and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way ? wow ! even still in this movie however , to quell seagals have-to-have-the-last-punch-and-no-one-can-kick-my-a $ $ ego , he is somehow stronger than they are . however all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him . come on , i can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer , but these are super human strength people . oh and get this , seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues , because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is wolverine ! oh my go ... and worst than all of that ! yes , there is a worse than that . he has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face . they obviously sound nothing like him and i believe it may be one of the other actors in the film . it was pure madness . although i wanted to turn it off i always watch a movie to he end . this is an all time low even for your direct to video movies steven . awful ! awful ! awful ! two thumbs down ! redemeption qualities ? well i guess so , i will be fair in that aspect . at least some of the special effects were ok , and i like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses . the women all were quite attractive imo . still , and i said still , it does not make up for the blatant x-men , underworld , ( insert your favorite zombie , vampire movie here ) rip off ! the director , writer , producer , all should be bansihed & exile from the movie business . i think i feel the way that most people feel about blood rayne ( and just about all other uwe boll pictures ) about this film . that 's my whole $ 1.00 on this film . view if you dare .
this dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent . in particular , dan aykroyd and howard hesseman are misused badly here . i might have chuckled once or twice during this film , but in general , it 's a boring movie , with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure . the premise , although routine , still was n't bad , but once the plot was set , the film went nowhere . do n't waste your time with this misfire .
the immortalizer was , uh , interesting . it certainly did n't kill me during its hour and a half duration , but it did n't impress me much either . a group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants ( in a scene featuring cinema 's least convincing head crushing sound effect ) and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs . here dr. divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again . hey , this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as freejack ! who knew that when you transplant an old person 's brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice ? with all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum , you can almost see visions of from beyond and re-animator dancing in the producers ' heads . but the production literally does n't have the guts to pull it off . i 've never understood why , when someone is making a low budget horror film , that they do n't pack it to the edge of the frame with gore . the acting is uniformly terrible , with the only good performance coming from clarke lindsley as the assistant dr. price . he has a nice evil laugh . the only other thing of note about the immortalizer is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts . seriously , most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old folks .
i saw the movie as a child when it was released in the theater and it was so bad that it became the makings of a family joke . if the ranking had a zero , this movie would get it . the dinosaurs were awful . the storyline was ridiculous . the acting really does n't qualify to be called acting . the only reason i even remember the name of the movie so well is because my family still talks about how bad it really was .
no , not the administration of gwb , the decider/strutter/smirker -- but the mini-series `` monarch cove . '' lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time , most of them broadcast between 11 p.m. friday nights and 1 a.m. saturday mornings . as to why i watched the whole thing , i can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attacks of masochism . most of the cast are unknowns who are likely to remain unknown . the only two recognizable names are shirley jones and rachel ward , who turn in the only decent performances ( jones does n't make it through the entire series -- lucky woman ) . ward , by the way , is aging quite well since her `` thorn birds '' days . the one main thread to the plot -- who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of dad 's murder but is freed after six years in the slammer -- is stretched out for so long and concluded so hastily that you wo n't especially care who dun it . there is a great deal of `` steamy '' sex , several murders , and all sorts of rude behavior -- virtually none of which is either interesting or credible . most of the cast is not particularly attractive and definitely not talented . the writing and direction is on a par with the cast . if you stick around to the end , the post card is a ( very minor ) hoot . consider yourself warned !
i really looked forward to this program for two reasons ; i really liked jan michael vincent and i am an aviation nut and have a serious love affair with helicopters . i do n't like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level . the world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a westland lynx several years ago . the only chopper that was ever faster was the experimental lockheed ah56a in the 1960 's . it hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter , which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its fuselage providing thrust . in short , no helicopter can fly much over 275 because of the principle of rotary wing flight . and the bell 222 , the `` actor '' that portrayed airwolf was n't very fast even by helicopter standards . and it did n't stay in production very long . there was a movie that came out during this time period called `` blue thunder '' that was much more realistic .
an ok flick , set in mexico , about a hit-man ( scott glenn ) who hitches a ride with struggling american writer and his mexican girlfriend after a hit . he pays them to take him to the border  but things get out of hand . it starts well enough , but quickly struggles and dies . * * spoiler * * the eventual relationship twist is badly set up and difficult to believe . an absence of passion , and essentially no reasoning behind her leaving one man for the other , made it ridiculous - and the ending was predictable and dull . * * end spoiler * * harvey keitel is the us agent on the hit-man 's trail , but he seems a little confused as to how boring and slow the script is ...
this film should have never been made . honestly , i must admit that before i saw it i had some serious doubts . the director is not a great actress , though she did a lot of movies in holland , and the young woman who took the main part is a tv-personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self-criticism . the actor who played the other main part i recently saw in bride flight and although that film is better , he did not convince me than . to start with the the story , i have not read the novel it is based upon , but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy sunday afternoon , not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie . something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues , it was most of the time spoken out loud . my regards go to the cameraman , at least he tried to make something out of it . it is a pity that the film is edited lousy , if not , some scenes were certainly more credible .
spoiler warning : there are some minor spoilers in this review . do n't read it beyond the first paragraph if you plan on seeing the film . the disney channel currently has a policy to make loads of movies and show one a month on the cable channel . most of these are mediocre and drab , having a few good elements but still being a disappointment ( ` phantom of the megaplex , ' ` stepsister from planet weird , ' ` zenon : girl of the 21st century ' ) . every once in a great while , they make something really , really great ( ` genius , ' ` the other me ' ) . but once in a while the disney channel makes a huge mistake , and gives us a real stinker . this month ( december 2000 ) the disney channel featured ` the ultimate christmas present , ' which i thought was terrible due to poor writing and worse acting . apparently , ` the brainiacs.com ' was rushed out a few days before christmas to get a jump on the holiday , because the plot has to do with toys . they even paid for a feature in the tv guide , so i thought it must be better than the norm . i was in for a complete shock . only disney 's ` model behaviour ' has been worse than this . the plot was more far-fetched than normal . i usually let that slide , but here it just goes too far . matthew tyler gets very sick of his widowed father spending most of his time at work . his father owns a small toy factory that has taken out large loans at a scrupulous bank to stay afloat . time and time again , his father has to skip out on the plans he makes with his son and daughter . matthew decides that the only way he can spend time with his dad is if he becomes the boss and orders him to stay home . he gets a hair-brained idea to create a website where kids all around the world can find and send him a dollar to invest in a computer chip that his sister is inventing . that whole concept is full of fallacies . when kids send in millions of dollars , matthew opens his own company 's bank account and buys up most of his dad 's business 's stock . he is the secret boss , but he does n't reveal this to his dad , but instead presents himself at board meetings as a cartoon image through a computer . that image itself is so complex ( and ridiculous ) that it is n't possible for someone to create it at home , much less someone who comes across as stupid as matthew . to make a long plot short , matthew orders his dad to spend more time having fun and doing stuff with his kids , but a federal agent shows up inquiring about matthew 's company , as it is fraudulent . there 's so much wrong here . as mentioned , the stuff they do here is impossible even for true geniuses , which these kids are not . the website , the cartoon image , the computer chip , even the stuff they are being taught in school , are far too advanced for these kids . the acting by most of the cast , especially kevin kilner , is terrible . some familiar faces are wasted . dom deluise plays the evil bank owner , but his part is a throwaway . he has one good scene with alexandra paul ( who shows she has the ability to act ) in which he explains his motives , but nothing more . and rich little is wasted in a small role as a judge . there 's even some offensive and uncalled for anti-russian jokes . but the greatest atrocities are the hard-hammered themes . these themes show up in many of the disney channel 's films , but never before have these ultra-conservative messages been pounded so strongly . the typical ` overworking parent ' idea is really pushed hard , and after delivering it inappropriately in ` the ultimate christmas present , ' seeing it again sours my mood . family relations are important , but disney must stop this endless preaching , because working is important to maintaining a workable family , too . except for cancelling activities thanks to work , the father did n't come across as that bad , but i found it offensive when the grandmother told him ` i do n't like what i see . ' just as bad is the preaching of the idea that all single parents must marry if they want to raise their kids right . enter alexandra paul , whose character , while important to the plot , is there solely to be the love interest for the father . this offensiveness only proves that the disney brain trust lacks the brains to avoid scraping from the bottom of the disney script barrel . instead of letting this movie teach your kids how to commit serious fraud , wait for the next disney channel movie . it has to be better than this . zantara 's score : 1 out of 10 .
this movie should not be watched as it was meant to be a flop . ram gopal verma first wanted to make this a remake of classic bollywood movie `` sholay '' , but after having problems with the original makers decided to go ahead with the project and ... i guess leave all the good parts of the movie ( acting , script , songs , music , comedy , action etc ) out and shoot the movie just because he already happen to hire the crew . waste of money , waste of time . after making movies like rangeela , satya , and company he pulled a coppola ( godfather ) on us ; what were you thinking rgv ? anyways , the story is , though hard to follow , is almost like the old sholay . ajay devgan playing heero ( beeru , sholay ) and ajay , new kid on the block playing ajay ( jay , sholay ) . both `` bad yet funny '' friends help a cop capture a bad guy first . later in the movie , now retired cop hires them as personal security and safeguarding from the hands of a very most wanted bubban played by amitabh bachan . in case you have n't been watching bollywood movies , the good guys win in the end . there i just saved you 3 precious hours of your life !
this movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself . i think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage . the main characters are the whiny non-hero kevin , amy , his bratty , ungodly conservative girlfriend , kyle , a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex , daphne , a scrawny , horny girl who is supposed to be `` cool '' and has no sense of how to dress , and her oversexed boyfriend nick , an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything . no , i 'm not a pervert , that 's really how the movie goes . the movie itself is an over-sexed rip-off of 1986 's gremlins , only you 'll never find a trace of gizmo anywhere . no , these hobgoblins , unleashed by wimpy man ( i 'm sorry , kevin ) , make someone 's wildest dreams come true , and then kill the victims . yes , you guessed it-eventually , they wind up in a strip club , where the nerdy amy 's greatest dream is revealed-she wants to be a stripper ! look , i watched this flick via mst3k , and even with mike nelson , tom servo , and crow t. robot making a laughing-stock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes . not really , but i wish i had . i 'm not giving you anymore plot , because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain . besides , it 's not like there 's a plot worth mentioning . they should put a surgeon 's general warning on this film .
after watching revolt of the zombies starring future academy award winner dean jagger i was left with one burning question . how was a society that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever defeated in the first place ? that 's the question you 'll be pondering if you take time to watch revolt of the zombies . towards the end of world war i , the french discover a cult from occupied cambodia where these undead creatures who can not be stopped with bullets form a brigade of monks who go over the top and dislodge the hun . this scares the living fecal matter out of everyone concerned so an international expedition is formed to find out destroy the secret of these zombies so no nation can get their hands on it and rule the world . but we 've got some dissent in those ranks . first is snidely whiplash villain roy d'arcy who murders the buddhist monk who has the secret and second is dean jagger . power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and he 's determined to woo dorothy stone away from rival robert noland . i think you 've got some idea how this comes out , especially since a race of zombies did n't conquer the world for one country . dean jagger as he got the oscar for twelve o'clock high must have shuddered every time he thought about this film and the awful dialog he tried to give a spark of sincerity to . moral of the story , you might make an ultimate warrior with the zombie potion and the zombie chant , but you ca n't make an ultimate love slave .
this low-grade universal chiller has just been announced as an upcoming dvd release but , intended as part of a collection of similar movies that i already had in my possession , i decided to acquire it from other channels rather than wait for that legitimate release . which is just as well , since the end result was not anything particularly special ( if decently atmospheric at that ) : for starters , the plot is pretty weak  even though in a way it anticipates the vincent price vehicle theatre of blood ( 1973 ) albeit without any of that film 's campy gusto . what we have here , in fact , is a penniless sculptor ( martin kosleck )  whom we even see sharing his measly plate of cheese with his pet cat !  who , upon finding himself on the receiving end of art critic alan napier 's vitriolic pen one time too many , decides to end it all by hurling himself into the nearby river . however , while contemplating just that action , he is anticipated by rondo hatton 's escaped killer dubbed `` the creeper '' and , naturally enough , saves the poor guy 's life with the intention of having the latter do all the dirty work for him in gratitude ! although it is supposedly set in the art circles of new york , all we really see at work is kosleck and commercial painter robert lowery ( who keeps painting the same statuesque blonde girl joan shawlee over and over in banal poses  how is that for art ? ) who , conveniently enough , is engaged to a rival art critic ( virginia grey ) of napier 's ! before long , the latter is discovered with his spine broken and lowery is suspected ; but then investigating detective bill goodwin gets the bright idea of engaging another critic to publish a scathing review of lowery 's work ( i did not know that publicity sketches got reviewed ! ! ) so as to gauge how violent his reaction is going to be ! in the meantime , kosleck deludes himself into thinking that he is creating his masterpiece by sculpting hatton 's uniquely craggy  and recognizable  visage which , needless to say , attracts the attention of the constantly visiting grey ( we are led to believe that she lacks material for her weekly column ) much to the chagrin of both artist and model . bafflingly , although the creeper is fully aware of how grey looks ( thanks to her aforementioned haunting of kosleck 's flea-bitten pad ) , he bumps off shawlee  who had by then become goodwin 's girl !  in lowery 's apartment and , overhearing kosleck talking to ( you guessed it ) grey about his intention to dump him as the fall guy for the police , sends the slow-witted giant off his deep end even down to destroying his own now-completed stony image . curiously enough , although this was hatton 's penultimate film , his name in the credits is preceded by the epithet `` introducing '' !
i so wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country recognises is slapstick and stereotypes . of course , it went completely the other way - let 's be cool and edgy - and came out the other side with little to show for it . i bet one small seed went nuts for this . i know sl did . none of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off . even danny k had better timing . i 'm actually being serious . every time they introduced a bit character i kept thinking , `` darn , this person should have been the lead ! '' . independent does n't mean that the camera work needs to be horrible . black and white did nothing for this movie - actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp relief . the black and white also was n't crisp . the composition was horrible . the use of music was horrible . strangely enough i watched little miss sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb - maybe that 's why the deficiencies in this movie stick out in my mind . i think corne ( who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything ) was speaking to this movie and not david - see it and you 'll understand . i bet the guys who organise oppikoppi were dismayed . one would think nothing happens there at all . i got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone 's back garden . i know regular guys who have much funnier , raunchier and wittier conversations than any of these `` comics '' . the dude who they hooked up with end was ok though . guess sa comedy 's gon na stay in the stone age a little longer . nice work guys .
not that `` a film by ulli lommel '' filled me with hope , but i must confess that zodiac killer managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations . there is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects , which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock . but many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid . the effect is never perfect , but it helps . unfiltered digital video really only works for the `` mockumentary '' style , because it never looks like anything other than video . therein lies the primary trouble with zodiac killer . watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer . it does not feel like watching a movie . and what 's even more unforgivable is that the lommel is not a young filmmaker . he ought to know better . he ought to know that it 's virtually impossible to generate horror ( or even suspense ! ) on video . for the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties ! he may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business . and lucky us , he wrote the script too ! so you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing , unjustified behavior , and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied . please , please miss this film . you 'll thank me later .
i 'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot ( ! ) for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest , crappiest movie i 've ever seen ! i have no idea what 's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here ( imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings ) ... the only thing i can imagine is that people must 've voted during one or more conditions : 1 . while being shitfaced / stoned out of their minds 2 . they 've received hard cash for the votes 3 . under gunpoint i ca n't believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie .
ahh , the dull t.v . shows and pilots that were slammed together in the 70 's to make equally dull t.v . movies ! some examples would be riding with death ( the most hysterically cheesy of the lot ) , stranded in space ( confusing and uninteresting ) , san francisco international ( horribly dull and unbelievably confusing ) , and this turgid bit of quinn martin glamor . shot in hawaii ( although you would n't know it from the outside shots ) , it 's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show . the real problem is that you don ; 't like most of the characters , including the drab main character diamond head , who seemed half asleep for the entire movie ; his boss 'aunt mary ' , who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on ; diamnd head 's girlfriend/fellow agent ( hell , i ca n't even remember her name ) a skinny , wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting ; and the singing sidekick zulu ( again , i ca n't remember his character 's name ) who was n't bad in small doses . the most interesting person in the whole production was ian mcshane , who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops . alothugh the make-up jobs this so-called 'chameleon ' used to disguise himself were just laughable . i have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a south american dictator cum american general . nor do i care . the plot simply was n't interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time , let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on . just call this one - hawaii five no !
the dereks did seem to struggle to find rolls for bo after `` 10 '' . i used to work for a marine park in the florida keys . one day , the script for `` ghosts ca n't do it '' was circulating among the trainers in the `` fish house '' where food was prepared for the dolphins . there was one scene where a -dolphin- supposedly propositions bo ( or bo the dolphin ) , asking to `` go make eggs . '' reading the script , we -lauuughed- ... we did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility , although our dolphins -were- in `` the big blue ! '' this must have been very close to the end of anthony quinn 's life . i hope he had fun in this film , as it certainly did n't do anything for his legacy .
... but it 's certainly not without merit . already writer-director preston sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories , creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations , and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue . ( no wonder the coen brothers ' next movie is going to be an homage to sturges . ) the major problem is that the plot 's not all the way there yet ; it lacks surprise , the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing . the coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon , and the ending is thoroughly predictable . frank capra does this sort of thing much better . if you 're new to preston sturges , check out `` the lady eve '' or `` sullivan 's travels '' or `` the miracle of morgan 's creek '' first . if you 've seen these already , then go ahead and watch this one .
tv version of `` twister '' springs a few leaks but manages to remain watchable . my sister bought this at a wal-mart a few years back when it was released , i saw it back then and thought it was okay . later `` twister '' with bill pullman and helen hunt comes out ( or was it before ? i think it was '97 ) and did a better job overall . but `` twister '' was more silly fun ; this is realistic with a message . it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters : twisters , or a low-budget character study ? john schneider and devon sawa ( he 's the reason my sister bought it ) star , and devon sawa , who went on to `` wild america , '' `` final destination '' and `` slackers '' got his big break here . so in a way , i was one of the first people to see him really take off . i do n't know if it 's an honor or a shame , i have n't seen how he acts in recent films . `` night of the twisters '' all depends on personal taste , like i said , it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters : twisters , or a low-budget character study . `` night of the twister '' has the latter . so you decide . i give it a 2.5/5 ... - john ulmer
well i must say this is probably the worst film i have seen this year ! the jokes were extremely crude ( was n't expecting it from as pg movie ) ( rated pg in canada ) and they were n't funny ! with this great cast i at least expected some good acting but i did n't even get that . i am a huge rainn wilson fan and this is the first time i was extremely disappointed by his performance . neither luke wilosn or uma thurman 's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them . i did n't expect this at all as in the past i have really liked other movies by this director ( six days , seven nights for example ) this movie was not worth the $ 10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie . i guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over .
this film is absolutely awful , but nevertheless , it can be hilarious at times , although this humor is entirely unintentional . the plot was beyond ridiculous . i do n't even think a 2 year-old would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the film-makers tried to slap together into a story . however , on the positive side , some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor . for example , `` wow , lady hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard ! '' it gets worse ( and even funnier ) , but i 'll spare you . the acting is generally laughable . most of the kids ' roles are sort of cute , but not very believable . on the other hand , annie is pretty awful all-around . the adults do n't take their roles seriously at all , but this is largely a good thing . if they 'd tried to be believable , the film would 've been even worse . which is difficult to imagine . once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie , there are actually a few standout moments of almost-not-crappiness . the scene where lady hogbottom 's son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious , though it 's an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police . the butler character , while very minor , is a ray of sunlight that almost , but never quite pierces through the gloom . watching this movie actually caused me physical pain . nevertheless , there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally . judged on its good parts alone , the movie would be about a 5 ; unfortunately , the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1 . thus , i give it a 3 . that 's being pretty generous , i 'd say .
memoirs of a geisha is a beautifully filmed movie , there is no doubt about that . and the acting is generally excellent , at least in terms of how it portrays the characters as they are scripted . however , so many details small and large are just _wrong_ that it just bothers me too much to be able to enjoy it fully . a small detail that typifies the kind of lack of sensitivity of sorts is one scene ( no this does not spoil anything ) where mameha rings a bell that hangs at the door of the house where sayuri lives , on a snowy winter day . the bell she 's ringing is a fuurin , or wind chime - that is only left hanging outside of houses in japan in the summer ! people in traditional japanese homes did n't have doorbells - they just opened the door and announced themselves . ( you may think this is such a trivial detail , but i would equate this to a movie made about america where a christmas wreath is hanging on the door in july and no one thinks anything of it . ) and do n't even get me started on the totally wrong hairstyles given to the maiko and geisha , which is vaguely pan-asian/chinese/kung-fu-ish , and nothing like real thing . i think this rather cavalier attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too . so , i suppose that the less you know about japanese culture and the world of the geisha and maiko in kyoto ( which is what `` miyako '' is ) , then i suppose the more you will enjoy this . i honestly think this movie could have been so much better ... as it is , it 's just another hollywood version of `` exotic japan '' .
please ! do not waste any money on this movie . it really is nothing more than a boring german blair witch ripoff made by some high school kids . i could n't finish watching it , and usually i like watching all kinds of b-movies . how on earth could they find a distributor for it ? ! ! ! funny however : check out wikipedia for `` dark area '' . the guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind . maybe he got loads of money from the producers . money that should have been spend on actors , camera and editing . even that would n't have helped , since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film . unfortunately `` dark area '' has already gotten too much attention . please , director , producer and author of this movie , stop making movies like that ... you are not doing yourself a favor . the world would be a better place without this film .
my first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us blair witch project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage . the acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of oklahoma and the plot , such as there was , is predictable , boring and inane . 85 % of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them . mother f seems to be the `` writer 's '' favorite because it is used constantly . it must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call . thank god i rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward . do n't waste your time or money with this .
i 'll admit i 've only watched a handful of episodes , but each one seemed completely different from the next . it seems after the first season , the producers decided to completely retool the show , drop characters , introduce new ones , and rewrite the entire show dynamic . as you have probably surmised already , the show is about quirky , unpredictable teenager holly ( amanda bynes ) who moves in with her high strung sister valerie ( jennie garth ) in new york city . decent enough premise : odd couple + fish out of water + high jinx . while i miss the sitcoms of yore , this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly , and it 's sad because they have some decent talent . on top of everything , they insisted on changing the show ( val was living with a cast regular bf one season , then he was suddenly gone , so she opens a bakery ? what ? ) when things change that drastically , you get the feeling that even the * show * knows it 's bad . i mean , completely new sets , characters written off and new show regulars ! on a side note ( this is just nitpicking ) , i know this is a television show and not real at all , but val and holly end up living in a huge loft duplex ( there are stairs ) with a terrace ... in manhattan ! are you serious ! ?
i am currently sitting here , forcing myself to finish this . i figure i blew 6 bux on the vhs , might as well suffer for it . i remember about 4 or 5 years ago doing a search on the internet for `` war of the worlds '' cause of the rumors of the spielberg movie at the time , and i missed the old tv series from the early 90 's . the website make it out that this was a multi-million dollar budget rendition of the classic book . it was going to be a `` perfect translation '' . perfect crap is more in tune with this film . first off , the video on this movie was glitched ! it looked as if i was watching the full motion video from an old mid-90 's pc or playstation cd-rom video game . sadly enough , the color quality was similar . the acting made shatners classic `` dramatic pause '' look damn near shakespearean in quality . the cg rendering of various scenes was horrendous , and green screen sequences were worse than those seen in old dukes of hazardd scenes . secondly , it is slow and terribly drawn out . i sat thru 45 minutes of the video ( no promo 's at the beginning ) before the cylinder actually opened to reveal the first alien . after that , the alien was a terribly constructed cg squid . i am now an hour into it and the most of the alien weaponry i have seen is a spinning silver disk ( crappy down even ) attached to a mechanical arm . the dramatic scenes are murdered with overly done instrumental 's . the last thing on that , for an alien invasion in the turn of the century 1900 's no one is concerned for their life . it 's like they have no concept . even though media was slow , word of mouth spreads fast and people would have known . the `` illusion '' of day and night was shoddy at best . simply changing the color around the people to purple , blue or green does not signify night time . perhaps some lighting and actual night time shoots would have given a much better illusion . there is a lot of wasted sequences throughout the film of just watching the `` hero '' gallop around or walk down silly roads . get on with the film . i know how people get around , you do not need to be so in-depth . now , finally an hour and 5 minutes into the film and they show the alien machines . mighty morphin power rangers had better looking effects . even the skeletons of vaporized humans looked as if animated by a freshman high school computer app class student . the animations do not match up to the scenery at all . in closing folks , if you want `` the war of the worlds '' , do one of four things . 1 ) watch the 1953 original , 2 ) watch the early 90 's tv series , 3 ) wait for spielberg 's rendition to be released shortly , or 4 ) read the frikkin book ( something we all probably did in elementary english class ) . avoid this movie . it is a waste of your money .
oh my god ! please , for the love of all that is holy , do not watch this movie ! it it 82 minutes of my life i will never get back . sure , i could have stopped watching half way through . but i thought it might get better . it did n't . anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is one seriously sick and twisted individual . no wonder us australians/new zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies . everything about this movie is horrible , from the acting to the editing . i do n't even normally write reviews on here , but in this case i 'll make an exception . i only wish someone had of warned me before i hired this catastrophe
georgia rule has got to be one of - if not the worst movie i have ever seen in my life . the whole movie has a very surreal feel that made me gasp , `` what ? '' out loud at least 7-10 times throughout its grueling two hour course . advertised in its trailer as a movie about three generations of women - jane fonda as the matriarch , felicity huffman as her daughter , and lindsay lohan as the rebellious , over- sexed , scantily clad grand-daughter , the viewer thinks this will be a cliché , light , chick-flick about growing up and coming together as a family . talk about false advertisement at it worst . after many shots of animals doing `` funny '' things in the background of `` pivotal '' scenes and not to mention a whole five minutes focusing on an old woman who comes into a doctor 's office weekly to have her diaper changed , or the fact that this movie is actually about lindsay lohan 's character being sexually abused by her step-father , georgia rule creates its own genre of cinema : the ungrounded , horribly acted , inappropriate comedy dealing with extremely serious issues in the most awkward , surreal , strange way . if garry marshall wanted this movie to be a drama/comedy , then he should have watched the royal tenenbaums . sideways . junebug . and so on . and so on . the only way i feel i can get a reader to understand the horrific genre that georgia rule falls under is to create a hypothetical situation . say that the movie , the 40 year old virgin , was about the main character being celibate because he was sexually molested as a child . but instead of having the movie take a more dramatic turn , belly laughs and comedy would ensue , with all of the characters ' reactions being that of fake , lifeless , human beings pretending to care . throw in a yellow parakeet , dermot mulroney as the flattest , most non-dimensional character that could have been cut completely out of this poorly written script , along with a male character who throws away all of his religious beliefs and morals to be with a trashy , too-tanned girl who shares none of the same interests as he , as well as an an unnecessary car chase scene , unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other , and you 've got georgia rule . i found this movie to be an insult to any of those people out there who are struggling filmmakers , screenwriters , actors , editors , etc .. who have a lot more talent and are n't getting noticed . do n't see this movie : my rule . and if you must , get sufficiently drunk before hand .
star rating : * * * * * saturday night * * * * friday night * * * friday morning * * sunday night * monday morning james dial ( wesley snipes ) is hiding out on his ranch in montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist . then he 's approached by the agency again to travel to london to have another go . his target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection- but they do n't want him merely to capture their man- they want him taken out . all goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief , windsor ( charles dance ) is killed , the blame falls at dial 's feet . hunted like an animal , he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named emily ( eliza bennett ) who 's dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him . this latest snipes straight to dvd escapade came out of nowhere , with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time ( i do n't recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere . ) with this in mind and after snipes 's history of duff dvd efforts , this might have seemed like one which snoop dawg would tell you to drop like it 's hot . but i felt compelled to give it a go anyway . it does n't rank among his worst , but it does n't reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones ( the detonator , 7 seconds , says it all , really ) , either . this is , at best , mildly suspenseful , with a minimal of action , naff all in the way of cool dialogue and snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role . likewise , in a main supporting role , it 's quite clear dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their cvs . it says a lot that by the end the only 'contract ' that 's keeping you interested is when snipes 's will end with sony and with it an end to any further sub par el dvd action films . * *
we should all congratulate uwe boll . he 's done the unthinkable . he may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on imdb ! he 's like some kind of cinematic cockroach . no matter how little talent he has , and no matter how bad these movies are , he manages to keep making them . i know , he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre german fund , but even so , his ability to keep making movies despite absolute , complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe . it would n't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy . i really enjoyed the alone in the dark series of games . even the latest one , the new nightmare , was good for a few hours of game play . there was a good movie to be made out of edward carnby 's adventures , but this is not it . now uwe boll has gotten his hands on bloodrayne and hunter : the reckoning . what 's next , silent hill ? doom ? i can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he 's not stopped . someone needs to take away his line of credit , or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise , no one is interested in that title any more . think about it , is house of the dead or alone in the dark a viable game title anymore ? no way . a new house of the dead game comes out for x-box and nobody 's gon na care . the title is dead , and all because of uwe boll . so if any of you out there work for a game publisher , or know a game publisher , or have access to a game publisher ... please warn them . this movie itself is not even worth reviewing . i ca n't separate what i did n't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it . literally , everything about it sucks . the writing , the acting , the music , the cg effects , the editing . i thought that if i waited until it came out on dvd and then rented it with low expectations , i would n't be disappointed . boy , was i wrong . never underestimate uwe 's ability to turn out a big , steaming pile of boll sh * t .
if i could give it less that 1 i would . do not bother to rent ; if someone gives you the dvd burn it . this is horrible movie making . a total waste of even digital `` film '' . i have seen better on youtube made by 12 year old boys . lommel claims to have written this , if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages . the story line is none existent , the dialog is mainly screaming , the camera work is some sort of attempted arty flairs with nonsensical cutting of totally unrelated jumps to either industrial transportation scenes or some sort of odd angry young woman rift . i can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a `` creative '' film - i like david lynch . this one is either so far beyond my limited powers of comprehension i missed it or it is totally pointless . i think this is a `` lets see if we can grab a title that will be coming out soon and do a weird rift on it and see if we can grab some of the bucks '' con job . i can not see why lionsgate even bothered with this . totally worthless , it is so bad i will not rent any other by this same director .
wow . i read about this movie and it sounded so awful that i had to see it , and my gosh , i can smell it in st louis . where do i start ? national lampoons was trying to follow up 5 years later on the success of animal house , but they completely missed the mark . i 'll go chronologically with these short flicks . short film # 1 poor peter riegert ( boon from animal house ) . apparently , he was n't working back then , so the boys at national lampoons probably called and said `` hey , we 're making a c * * ppy movie , wan na be in it ? '' peter was like `` well , i 'm not doing much these days , why not ? '' he was a great side character in animal house , but he could n't carry this sorry short flop for 5 minutes . possible spoiler the premise is funny enough , with jason cooper ( riegert ) telling his wife to leave him , she needs to find herself . it 's too weird that they 're actually in a happy marriage . so he chases her off , there she goes , and cooper is in charge of the kids . this , off course , leads to him burning the house down , losing several of the kids , and sleeping with an assortment of new york bimbos ( including an ever so young diane lane ) . then the wife comes back , wants the kids , and the film ends with a coin flip that 'll decide the fate of the children . the idea was actually somewhat clever , but the director stunk . the characters all seem like they 're falling asleep , they had to be doped up . sorry boon , your legacy was tarnished with this flop . short film # 2 more spoilers enter dominique corsaire . pretty girl , recently finished college , not sure what to do with her life . so she becomes a slut , starts sleeping around with some mega rich guys , takes their money when they die , and she does n't stop until she beds the most powerful man in the world , fred willard ( ooops , i mean the president of the united states ) . once again , it could have been funny , and though i was happy that corsaire ( ann dusenberry in real life ) was n't afraid to bare all , her acting was horrible . what a waste of time . short film # 3 i ca n't believe i made it this far . here 's the rookie cop brent falcone ( robby benson ) with veteran stan nagurski ( richard widmark ) . falcone is young , naive , thinks he can really help people , though he becomes cynical after being shot several thousand times . nagurski , really , has just given up caring . he watches muggings , assaults , you name it , and never intervenes . he figures the world is lawless and he 'll probably get sued if he does anything . even christopher lloyd ( at the end of taxi 's run ) gets in on the action , getting the police called on him , committing a crime , but having his lawyer there to protect him . god bless america ! ! once again , could have been funny , the performances were intentionally campy , but goodness , no energy whatsoever . henry jaglom and bob giraldi should be ashamed of having their names on this schlock . i think the writing was n't bad , the ideas were there , but the execution was pulled off as well as the rescue attempt in the iranian hostage crisis . if i had been a part of this film , i would want my name removed , it 's horrible . then again , that 's why i watched it . the only good thing about this garbage is that dr john did the film score ( repeating `` going to the movies '' over and over again ) and the film is n't much longer than an hour and a half . show this one in film classes with the heading `` what you should never do in film-making . '' this script should have been left on the shelf because yep , it 's that bad .
at first , three words : read the book ! really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters . i loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film . it was ludicrous , with half a heart and the story bad explained . the novel - in the first place ! - was n't meant to focus on an adventure ! that 's only the surroundings . in the film , the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat ! additional , the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious ! they screwed it up ! ... i 'll never watch it again !
thhe remake was a superior movie remake in every way . most remakes end up being total garbage but under the very talented direction of alexandre aja became one of the best ever made in terms of remakes and also as far as the mutant inbreed human sub-genre of horror is concerned . in steps part 2 directed by another individual martin weisz and written by the father and son combo of jonathan and wes `` i can not make a good horror movie to save my life anymore '' craven and if this is any indication of weisz directing skills and young craven 's writing skills we are all in for a painful future as thhe 2 not only fails to be as good as the first but also fails to entertain on any level . we start off with a fairly graphic mutant baby birth which though is rather cool will not prepare you for the utter garbage that is to come , only hint to what could have been in this film . we then get to see a crew of scientists who all to briefly are introduced and dispatched by our radiated rejects . in steps our main cast of army reservist to save the day , this is where the major problems begin . from very sub par acting ( yes even for this kind of movie ) to the horrible characters to the lack of true carnage for most of its running time thhe 2 becomes a labor to watch as a lot of nothing happens as idiotic soldiers make mistake after mistake only to meet there demise not by the mutants but themselves . think the marines in aliens only the exact opposite and you have the idea of how well these soldiers are trained . this is the true shame of the film as most of the hills occupants do not get the kills you would like to see , like in the first film , in fact if this did not have thhe 2 attachment in the beginning and the brief overview in the beginning tying this loosely to the first this could have nearly been a sci-fi channel original . the mutant mountainbillies as well are not as amusing this time around in fact in a lot of way they are far inferior to our prior batch as they all come off as being rather under designed and uninteresting . also the one that took the cake was the sloth-like mutant ( you know sloth from the goonies ) who helps them out in the 3rd act . i was waiting for him to ask for a baby ruth or start going on about rocky road ice cream . truly disappointing and shameful is the only way to describe most of the goings on here . the gore is in the film but not nearly as visceral as the original in fact it seemed toned down for the most part as other than the mutant baby birth scene there really is n't anything that stood out like in the first . another major strike against this movie . so what did work here , the answer is nothing at all . this felt like a sequel designed specifically to make money off the success of the first and not to make an actually `` good '' film . i can go on about the crappy drill sgt. , the radio man that has a speech impediment ( that 's right , he is the kind of guy i want radioing in for help in a real crisis ) or the pacifist fighter that resembles the exact same character mold as our `` hero '' in the first film but i believe you get the point . this movie is not even in the same league or even the same planet as the first . it should have been given another title and been added to the saturday night line up on the sci-fi channel . a true shame as a solid sequel could have been made but alas it looks like another horror movie that drops the ball on nearly every level and will get one of my lowest scores as i give thhe 2 the same score as its part : 2/10 dreadful : words can not describe how bad this movie is a total polar opposite of its predecessor in every way , uninspired and down-right unnecessary . next time guys if your going to make a sequel this bad ... do n't even bother . please do n't go support this garbage at the theaters , save your money and thank me later ! ! ! !
1st watched 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 ( dir-brad sykes ) : mindless 3-d movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle . and yes , we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3d ! ! wow , not ! ! that has been done time and time again in 2d in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is the underlying story not the actual flesh-eating . that 's what made the original zombie classics good . the flesh-eating was just thrown in as an extra . we 're actually bored throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame ( twilight-zone like ) easily understood and slow-pacingly revealed finale 's . the last story is actually the story the movie started with ( having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town ) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie 's in that one as well . well , i think i 've said enough . watch the classics , not this 3d bore-feast .
the invisible maniac starts as a young kevin dornwinkle ( kris russell ) is caught by his strict mother ( marilyn adams ) watching a girl ( tracy walker ) strip through his telescope ... cut to 'twenty years later ' & kevin dornwinkle ( noel peters ) is now a physics professor who claims to have discovered a way to turn things invisible using a 'mollecular reconstruction ' serum . however during a demonstration in front of his fellow scientists it fails & they all laugh at him , dornwinkle goes mad kills a few of them & is locked away in a mental institute from which he escapes . jump forward 'two weeks later ' & a group of summer college students discuss the tragic death of their physics teacher when the headmistress mrs. cello ( stephanie blake as stella blalack ) says that she has hired a replacement , yes you 've guessed it it 's dornwinkle . the student do n't take to him & treat him like dirt , however dornwinkle has perfected his invisibility serum & uses it to satisfy his perverted sexual urges & his desire for revenge ... co-written & directed by adam rifkin wisely hiding under the pseudonym rif coogan ( i would n't want my name to be associated with this turd of a film either ) the invisible maniac is real bottom of the barrel stuff . the script by rifkin , sorry coogan & tony markes is awful . it tries to be a teenage sex/comedy/horror hybrid that just fails in every department . for a start the sex is nothing more than a few female shower scenes & a few boob shots , not much else i 'm afraid & the birds in the invisible maniac are n't even that good looking . the comedy is lame & every joke misses by the proverbial mile , this is the kind of film that thinks someone fighting an invisible man or having henry ( jason logan ) a mute man trying to make a phone call is funny . the invisible maniac makes the police academy ( 1984 - 1994 ) series of films look like the pinnacle of sophistication ! as for the horror aspect that too is lame . it 's also an incredibly slow ( it takes over half an hour before dornwinkles even becomes invisible ) , dull , predictable , boring & has highly annoying & unlikable teenage character 's . director rifkin or coogan or whatever does absolutely nothing to try & make the invisible maniac an even slightly enjoyable experience . there 's no scares , tension or atmosphere & as a whole the film is a real chore to sit through . he does nothing with the invisibility angle , just a few doors opening on their own is as adventurous as it gets . there is very little gore or violence , a bit of splashing blood , a few strangulations & the only decent bit in the whole film when someone has their head blown off with a shotgun , unfortunately he was invisible at the time & we only get to see the headless torso afterwards . the budget must have been low , & i mean really low because this is one seriously cheap looking film . dornwinkles laboratory is basically two jars on his bedside cabinet ! when he escapes from the mental institution he has all of one dog sent after him & the entire school has about a dozen pupils & two teachers . the invisible maniac is a poorly made film throughout it 's 85 minute duration , i spotted the boom mike on at least one occasion ... lets just say the acting is of a low standard & leave it at that . the invisible maniac is crap , plain & simple . i found no redeeming features in it at all , there are so many more better films out there you can watch so there is no reason whatsoever to waste your time on this rubbish . definitely one to avoid .
a memorable line from a short lived show . after viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense . instead of ready / break , our quarter back said football and the rest of the squad responded you bet ! a fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show . using this line added a unique element to our season that i 'll never forget . we had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line . the show was pretty much a stinker but it lives on in the memories of the 1977 pi kappa phi intramural flag football squad at west virginia tech .
this movie is so bad it hurts . the car doing 30 mph when it 's supposed to go 100 ... the shift lever that 's stuck ( in park ! ) , the nurse that drives for almost 2 hours with the cell phone on the shoulder ... ca n't any of the 2 morons take this damn phone ? there 's nothing credible in this crap . i would be ashamed to be seen in a movie like this !
does this film suck ! ! horrible acting , horrible script , horrible effects , horrible horrible horrible ! ! nothing redeeming here for even the most die-hard of horror fans ! a crazy killer stalks students at a college . people are showing up dead in the hallways , but still , class carries on as normal ? ? ? after about the 4th body , i would think that they could allow the students a few days break ! lol . this about as bad as it gets folks . this film should be shown as a means of torture to criminals . you have been warned !
seeing this movie , as i just did for the first time on turner classic ( which lists it as `` dangerous female '' ) , can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 bogart-astor version . ricardo cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk . i hope he remembered his dentist and his brylcreem salesman in his will ; they made him the actor he was . the women are all good , but no better than that . well , una merkel is a little better . more interesting are the `` original '' joel cairo and mr. gutman , who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the set-changing atmospherics of their successors in the roles , peter lorre and sydney greenstreet . humphrey bogart and mary astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake ; here , sam spade and ruth wonderley ( ! ) ca n't . this movie does n't exactly stink ; it lies there like a big slice of ham . its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the '41 `` falcon '' do n't just happen . on the 1-to-10 scale i rate it a 4 , mainly for the camera work and the supporting players .
with a movie called `` gayniggers from outer space '' how could you go wrong ? just throw in some over the top stereotypes for the characters , use the village people as the main suppliers for the soundtrack , and throw in tons of gay-gags . plot is unimportant . too bad , this film does n't contain any of this and every joke misses the spot . the characters all look alike apart from the german gaynigger , one or two jokes work , the rest fails . the title made me laugh and i was prepared to laugh even more about the film . my expectation were to high apparently .
why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it ? they ask why hollywood is n't making the money it used to . because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $ 10 to see their garbage . the tv show was what it was , good people in bad situations where the good il ' boys come out on top . it was n't gone with the wind but it was fun . this movie is garbage ! hollywood ca n't come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some $ $ $ $ . i only hope that this movie makes 10x 's less than it cost to make . the only one 's to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the general lee . the audience is the victim . do n't see it , watch the reruns of the tv show instead . they still hold up 20 years later .
in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre that was taken away by spoofs like scary movie and shriek if you know what i did last friday the 13th , valentine fails . why did people like halloween ? because it was original , new and went beyond anything that 's ever been done . why did they like scream ? because at least it made sense . valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that has hardly any gore what so-ever . the plot is so similar to halloween and urban legend it 's not funny . and the moment the killer comes on screen , you know who it is , it 's just sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable . the teen slasher genre is dead get over it ! 0 out of 10
this film is horribly acted , written , directed and produced . but it 's so campy it 's actually semi-watchable . that 's semi watchable . the storyline ( what little there is ) makes virtually no sense whatsoever . the barney drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds . many of the canadian supporting cast can be found in tv commercials .. none of them went on to anything else that i 'm aware of . and of course sly stallone 's even less talented brother well ..... =\ trivia : it was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of claremont , ont . ( about 20 miles n.east of toronto ) i recognized many local landmarks/intersections/buildings . i think the drive-in scene was filmed at the now demolished `` oshawa drive-in '' just before it was torn down .
tom wolfe 's sprawling , brilliantly observed satiric novel of life among new york snobbery gets a glossy look here but is nevertheless not well served . the film suffers not merely from the miscasting of everyman tom hanks as an uncaring yuppie , kewpie-doll melanie griffith as a manipulative southern belle and bruce willis ( ? ! ) as the darling of new york 's literati . the most serious miscasting was in the director 's chair . robert altman might have breathed life into these unlikeable characters and made them interesting , but brian de palma , for all of his visual sophistication , has never had an eye for the nuances of the human experience . the resulting film looks good but seems blah toward its subject of dehumanization in favor of status . honestly , if a satire does not make the viewer angry , what is the point ?
oh ... my ... god ... this is without a doubt the absolute cheesiest movie i have ever seen . the acting is bad , the story is weak , the characters are weaker , and the whole film just does n't make sense . couple this with mediocre directing , really strange scenes ( such as the one where the kid reaches over the ravine and mysteriously falls in ) , and thoroughly abysmal dialog ( `` look ! '' `` musta peed his pants ! `` ) , and you get one complete failure . not to mention the fact that the only thing mr. atlas looks like he could defeat is a case of chocolate bars . but this is part of the movie 's charm . sit down and watch it with a few of your friends for a good laugh . i love this movie , because it 's just so bad !
although the production and jerry jameson 's direction are definite improvements , `` airport '77 '' is n't much better than `` airport 1975 '' : slick , commercial rubbish submerging ( this time literally ) a decent cast . jack lemmon is the pilot of a packed airliner which gets hijacked by art thieves and crashes into the sea ( all the publicity claimed it was near the bermuda triangle , but there 's no mention of it in the film itself ) . when the rescue ships come to raise the airplane out of the water , we see all their cranes dropping ( rather blindly ) into the ocean and it 's hard not to laugh ( imagining the cranes plugging the plane , the passengers and the waterlogged script ) . nbc used to air what appeared to be the `` director 's cut '' , with at least an hour of extra footage -- mostly flashbacks -- injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a `` gilligan 's island '' episode . most exciting moment is the plane crash , and some of the players have a little fun : lee grant is an obnoxious drunk , brenda vaccaro a no-nonsense stewardess , joseph cotten and olivia de havilland are flirting oldsters . still , the personality conflicts and the excruciating military detail eventually tear at one 's patience . * * from * * * *
my take : a tired formula christmas comedy . the laughs are tired and the talents behind it seem to be too . i love the holidays as much as the next guy ( even if i often have a bad case of the holiday blues ) , but it seems it 's just being a dumping ground for a bunch of holiday comedies that would be bad movies on any day of the year , but that does n't make them any less painful during the season . as if we already had enough santa clause movies ( three and * gulp * still counting ) , who wants to see a movie about his brother ? in a plot that would be at home with disney 's santa clause franchise ( save the occasionally crude humor and santa 's `` little '' helper wearing a short skirt ) , fred claus is a one-joke premise that goes on for 116 minutes . sure , jolly ol ' saint nick has a brother , but where does it go from there ? it 's a shame really . fred claus is blessed with a cast that could have made it an enjoyable christmastime comedy that will probably melt away along with the snow , but it would have been so much better than this . vince vaughn is your typical snob , but we are led to believe he 's really the long lost brother of the never-aging santa ( paul giamatti ) , who invites his good ol ' brother to visit . mrs. claus ( miranda richardson ) is reluctant , and worse , an efficiency expert ( kevin spacey ) has come to keep a watchful eye on father christmas , and his this close to being shut down . hah ! and guess who plays santa 's mother ! kathy bates of course . elizabeth banks is santa 's helper charlene , john michael higgins is one of the elves , and rachel wiesz plays fred 's girlfriend ! si do n't know if i 'd praise the casting or to bash it . here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality , but they 're given way too little to work with . as for humor , the best that fred claus could possibly come up with is santa 's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a dj elf . i have to admit i had a few giggles involving fred attending a group counseling for celebrity brothers ( where he is joined by stephen baldwin , roger clinton and frank stallone ) , but the giggles begin and end there . worse still , the movie even succumbs into sentimentality that 's supposed to make us `` feel good '' and teach us a lesson about `` what christmas really means '' . apparently , what christmas means to hollywood is getting as much of our leftover christmas shopping money as they can . rating : * * out of 5 .
i was interested in the topic , and only fans of drew barrymore 's dancing on david letterman 's desk will find anything remotely interesting in it . ok , she shows some breast ( or maybe a body double does ) . the plot is slashed to bits and the acting is horrible . neither lead has any material to work with , as the direction of the film leads nowhere . do n't waste your time . see donnie darko instead if you want a creepy drew barrymore film , and if you want to see another , skip this and see darko again . the treatment of the doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal as well . refer to charles williams ' novel `` descent into hell '' for something worth considering instead . this is just an excuse to make a b film to go straight to video and suck some life out of people at blockbuster . what makes any of these people think the acting here was praiseworthy ? give me a break .
this was a rip-off of the same garbage we had to watch bob saget host during the half-hour before this . dave coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as america 's funniest home videos except with a hosts who have a combined iq of three . tawny kitaen must 've really needed the money and coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes . it was torture enough having to see him imitate popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on full house . that one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a grade a wedgie . coulier must 've needed to money to please alannis morisette while they were dating .
this movie is about tyrannus , a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus , a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead . tyrannus , we learn after about an hour , is also called demonicus . this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity , psychology and ourselves . the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little to-do list ( killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin ) by possessing the body of a college guy . he uses a magic mind-control helmet to do this , which the college boy willingly puts on his head , and then at several points in the movie , takes off and puts back on . maria performs oral sex on a poor man 's sean willian scott , and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove . tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason , and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this . utter misfortune . this movie is empty and will hurt you . see it .
i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad . it reminds me of a c-grade porn movie with one major difference : no porn . the story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul . maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable . at the very least , the pacing should have been picked up . while i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had , he should have spent more time on the story or better yet , get someone else to write it . many of the action scenes were just pointless . it was a complete waste of my time .
when i first saw a glimpse of this movie , i quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of lucille ball . rachel york 's portrayal of lucy is absolutely awful . lucille ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent . to think about a legend like lucille ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous . i can not believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better lucy , the producers decided to get rachel york . she might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of lucille ball is tough . it is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble lucille ball , but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent . if you noticed york 's portrayal of lucy in episodes of i love lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin , nothing is similar in any way-her expression , voice , or movement . to top it all off , danny pino playing desi arnaz is horrible . pino does not qualify to play as ricky . he 's small and skinny , his accent is unreal , and once again , his acting is unbelievable . although fred and ethel were not similar either , they were not as bad as the characters of lucy and ricky . overall , extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told . if people want to understand the real life situation of lucille ball , i suggest watching a & e biography of lucy and desi , read the book from lucille ball herself , or pbs ' american masters : finding lucy . if you want to see a docudrama , `` before the laughter '' would be a better choice . the casting of lucille ball and desi arnaz in `` before the laughter '' is much better compared to this . at least , a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing .
friz freleng 's 'speedy gonzalez ' was the second cartoon to feature the title character after robert mckimson 's 'cat-tails for two ' . in that cartoon , speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted . despite looking significantly more handsome , speedy never developed into much of a character . a big hat , tremendous speed and a bad mexican accent do not a classic character make and that 's pretty much all speedy ever had going for him . nevertheless , the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studio 's latter days . while these early speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently ( rather oddly ) paired up with daffy duck , they still leave much to be desired , relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula . in this self-titled episode , speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by sylvester the cat . although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon , sylvester 's role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat . his personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable . undemanding role of pursuer . this was always a problem in the tweety cartoons too but speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture . poor old sylvester would be forced to appear alongside speedy for many years to come . despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs , 'speedy gonzalez ' won an oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born .
watching smother was perhaps the longest not-quite-90-minutes of my life . there was n't a laugh to be had ; in fact , i do n't remember ever cracking a smile . diane keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle-aged chain-smoking dog hoarder , the textbook overbearing mother character , a relentlessly irritating woman who clearly suffers from some kind of personality disorder . she is manipulative , conniving , melodramatic , childish , narcissistic , and worst of all , boring . i suppose i should briefly mention the other characters , but why bother ? it was just a long string of movie clichés -- the dippy , socially inept distant relative who 's just trying to break into `` the industry '' , the gruff and long-suffering but somehow still lovable father , the mild- mannered wife who just ca n't take it anymore ( but eventually moves beyond the discord and resignedly comes home ) , the herd of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew throw pillows while everyone is away , etc . god , what a snore . i 've never been a diane keaton fan and smother only reminded me why . overacting is overacting , no matter how many pictures you did in your prime . her attempts at physical comedy were especially humiliating . what was the director thinking ? while i like dax shepard and can even sometimes tolerate liv tyler , their performances were so lackluster and dull that it was clear that neither actor gave a damn about this movie . that was okay , because neither did i. keaton 's endless self-absorbed prattling was intolerable and at times shepard 's dislike for her seemed genuine . by the end of the movie i wanted to slap her myself . awful .
a good idea , badly implemented . while that could summarize 99 % of the scifi channel 's movies , it really applies here . i love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed , and i like action movies , and i like all of the main actors , so this could have been great . however , despite some good acting , this movie fails due to bill platt 's bad writing and directing . another review made the good point of needing to know where you 're going so you can get there . this movie does n't . it 's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words `` second draft '' are not in bill platt 's vocabulary . there is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing . this scene even begins and ends with them driving a car , so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle . this movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others , some to the point where you can guess the entire `` plot '' up front . it also had a habit of aborting a fight early , probably just because they could n't afford it . there are also a few laughably bad scenes where the `` plot '' is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed `` toxic adhesive '' ( seriously , what * is * that ? ) . if you are a fan of shiri appleby , watch this movie because she 's ok. she does manage to break out of her `` roswell '' persona a few times and make for a good tough chick ( but not always ) . john de lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he 's ever done since playing q back in st : tng , so that 's nothing new . in all , i gave this movie a 4/10 rating .
i can not see why filmmakers remade this movie . the 1972 movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic . steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor . he has no passion in his play.also the action in the original `` getaway '' was fantastic . but the remake has no action ! it is almost boring despite the fact that the film-making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994 . i do n't understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico . i think this is a mistake in the story . so i think that there was no need to remake it , or if they decided to remake a classic , they must choose an excellent actor for the first role , like johnny depp or brad pitt ...
unbelievably awful film . i watched part of this on t.v . recently . my jaw dropped as i watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind-numbing drivel . not a single line from the master of one-liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle . it was so bad it made me want to exhume rodney dangerfield 's body , slap him around and scream , `` how could you ? '' i know many films are done in haste , hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme . but please , hollywood , show a little respect for your audience . it 's sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe . the bottom of the cesspool , even by sunday afternoon television standards .
this is a film that belongs firmly to the 50 's . very surprising that american film institute has chosen this one for one for the best 100 american movies of all-time . i have seen practically all of the movies on that list , and this one is by far the most disappointing one of those . musical numbers ( and there many , many of them ) are very overlong and boring , and have absolute no connection with the story . the end of the movie has horribly over-long ballet sequency , which naturally has no real relation to the story of the movie . it must be admitted , that it is very well made , the music is ok , and the dancing done with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the movie . the main character of the movie is extremely childlish and unlikeable and behaves in unpolite way . his mental age is about 14 . if you want to see a good musical made on the `` golden age '' of musicals , go and see `` singing in the rain '' .
the first point that calls the attention in `` for ever mozart '' is the absence of a plot summary in imdb . the explanation is simple since there is no story , screenplay , plot or whatever might recall the minimum structure of a movie . jean-luc godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry and this pointless crap is among his most hermetic films . i believe that neither himself has understood what is this story about ; but there are intellectuals that elucubrate to justify or explain this messy movie , and it is funny to read their reviews . my vote is one . title ( brazil ) : `` para sempre mozart '' ( `` forever mozart '' )
when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers , it was films like the garden of allah . how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me . also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me . the garden of allah , one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12 . it then got two silent screen adaptions . the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he 's missed in the world . he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent . she 's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train . the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer . i 'm not sure what was in david o. selznick 's mind in filming this story . someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience . but you can bet that the movie-going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title . the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting . as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret . the monastery will have to rethink it 's economics if boyer leaves . the monks are a sincerely pious group , but from the head man charles waldron on down they 've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest . anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts . most especially marlene dietrich . i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot .
i just finished `` dark chamber '' aka `` under surveillance '' and i 'm stunned . stunned , not by the film , but by some of the rave reviews i perused which influenced my watching it . the story was so ravaged by plot-holes and the majority of the acting so flat , categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate . seriously , i found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as i endured this movie . justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer-addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite mom 's warnings that dad is no good . when a young woman is found murdered , justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments . with the help of a couple pals , he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks . as the truth begins to unravel , justin uncovers an unexpected secret . one positive point is that felissa rose is hot ! i would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit , but no such luck . it would have been the film 's potential saving grace . eric conley played justin very adeptly , i thought , and i would n't be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future . the general premise of the film , although plagued by clichés , might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow `` performances '' of key cast members , most notably alexandra eitel ( kayla ) and david h. rigg ( justin 's father ) . the horror ! ( pardon the pun ) . i have nothing against low-budget films . indeed , i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come . i 'll cut low-budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects , lighting , even musical score and the overall picture quality . i do n't give allowances , however , for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover 's script . there are a vast number of competently-made low budget films out there . sadly , this is n't one of them . i ca n't help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised `` dark chamber '' here are in some way affiliated with its production .
'the vampire bat ' is definitely of interest , being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930 's , but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise . the film is set in a european village sometime in the 19th century , where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals . there is a very similar feel to james whale 's 'frankenstein ' and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwill 's dr niemann character , complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement . the vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring by having suspicion fall on bat-loving village simpleton herman ( dwight frye ) , thus providing the excuse for a torch-wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed one . this is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray co-starred ( also 'doctor x ' and 'the mystery of the wax museum ' ) and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements . taken in context though , 'the vampire bat ' is still weak and derivative . all we are left with is a poor-quality frankenstein imitation , with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans . but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the 'blondie ' films a few years later .
an interesting idea involving an alternative dimension inside a hospital . it recalled - stephen kings `` langoliers '' , `` kingdom hospital '' and old twilight zone episodes . atmospherically strong , the set up was great . there were also some very clever 'time loop ' moments which always have that head-melt appeal . the story had plenty of vague references which led me to believe that all the ensuing weirdness of - time slips / ghosts / a weird bat winged demon and a rather silly heavy metal attired ghoul-thing would be explained . and that was were dark floors severely let me down . based on my viewing the movie gives no explanation as to what is behind the events . whilst , some ambiguity is always expected/welcome in these kind of films . dark floors took it to new heights of vagueness . i do n't expect things wrapped up in a pretty ribbon , but neither should i be left feeling `` huh ? .. is that it ? ... did i dose off ? maybe , i hit chapter skip by mistake ? '' dark floors left me with a deeply unsatisfying suspicion that `` it was all a dream '' which is a shame because up until the last reel i was very much on board and enjoying the movie .
i bought this on dvd for my brother who is a big michelle pfeiffer fan . i decided to watch it myself earlier this week . it is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines . the section with michelle pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two . she plays a rising hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships . she literally bumps into brian kerwin ( a regular married guy with kids ) after driving her car into the back of his . after being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive . romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out . what happens at the end i was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine tv direction takes any drama out of the plot . the other section involves an old studio boss played by darren mcgavin . this section actually has the better cast with kenneth mcmillan , lois chiles , steven bauer & stella stevens . they all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign , they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere . it passes the time but is not all that interesting and i am glad this was not bought for me . i am not a michelle pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress . overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine .
the five or so really good westerns that mann made are unequaled as an ensemble in hollywood . even john ford never made that many with so much quality . the curious thing about them all is how uneven they are . ford 's my darling clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them . or at least two . the real hero of them besides mann and stewart is chase . chase being responsible for the brilliant red river . chase wrote far country , bend of the river , and probably some others . but none of them are as finished as my darling clementine , but then very few films , western or otherwise are . each of the five films of mann have huge gaps , or is it six , lets see . bend , far , man of the west , furies , winchester 73 , and yep , six , naked spur . each have magnificent scene after magnificent scene , with fairly glaring lapses . yet so does red river , which is still the single greatest western ever made . so perfection is n't everything . but the far country has huge , huge holes . it 's mawkish , and really comes alive only when stewart and mc entire are locking horns . the rest is pretty pedestrian , with the usual exception of mann 's camera . mann 's camera is a one man course in cinematography . it is about as good an eye as anybody who ever got behind a strip of moving film . it is almost never in the wrong place , never . the far country has one amazing moment . and as usual it comes from stewart . nobody in the history of cinema ever received physical punishment with the authority of that man . he is absolutely amazing : look at him in bend , far , winchester , and man from laramie : in bend has been beaten up and is hanging by a thread so believably and with such boiling hatred he looks like somebody displaced from dachau , in far he is shot off a raft with such violence , it looks so convincing that you wince , and of course when he is dragged through the fire in man , well you find yourself looking for the burn marks . what an actor . not to mention the moment in winchester when he is beaten up early in the hotel room , also as well as anybody ever did it . but that was mann 's territory : look at gary cooper fighting with jack lord in man of the west . as painful as any fight scene ever recorded . cooper while not being quite as convincing as stewart , nevertheless is somehow his equal in looking exhausted at the end of the fight . in short , nobody but nobody but nobody ever showed the human being in extremis as well as mann . what a great , great director . see every western he ever made . they are his real monuments , even if all are scetchy . but so what . when he gets roaring with his great scenes they are as good as anybody , including ford . and his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever done by anyone , period . thanks , anthony .
this was the third remake of sleeping with the eniemy after yaarana ( 1995 ) and agnisakshi ( 1996 ) agnisakshi was the only one which worked and was a better film daraar is directed by abbas mustan who sadly failed in their attempt here the story was good but the handling was n't that good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax too was disappointing direction is bad music is good rishi reprises his role of yaarana ( strangely which also was a remake of swte ) and looks too fat for the lead and is okay juhi is decent while arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and does manage in many scenes to chill the audiences but his voice was terrible johny is too loud
`` blood of the sacred , blood of the damned '' is the third installment of the gabriel knight games , a series of adventure games about the roguish writer/paranormal detective , gabriel knight . gabriel and his companion , grace , have been asked by prince james of albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so-called `` night visitors . '' when the son of prince james is kidnapped , gabriel pursues the night visitors to rennes le château , where he begins piecing together a mystery relating to the holy grail . despite the marketing , this game is not about vampires . vampires have a token appearance in the game , but never command center stage , as did the voodoo hounfor in `` sins of the fathers '' or the werewolves in `` the beast within . '' gabriel and grace make no attempt to uncover the true nature of vampires , or to research lore on vampires . although the vampires do murder three people during the course of the game , their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot . a large part of the charm of the first two gabriel knight installments was in the relationships which gabriel formed with the villains . through these relationships , the player could not help but sympathize with the villain , and thus the villain was transformed into more of a human and less of a monster . however , in `` blood of the sacred , '' gabriel 's only interaction with the villain is through a single , cheesy interview , which does nothing to endear the villain to the player . the roles that gabriel and grace play in this mystery are fairly futile . gabriel spends his time snooping into the identities of members of a treasure-hunter tour group staying at his hotel , but what he uncovers amounts to nothing more than a red herring . grace spends her time researching the mystery of rennes le château , but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a perplexing ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries . the actions of this perplexing ally and his polar opposite -- - the vampire leader -- - are insupportable . the ally leaves hints about the mystery of rennes le château in broad daylight and expects grace ( and not the other treasure hunters from the tour group ) to find them . however , he could have revealed the mystery to grace in its entirety on day 1 , instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours . and in the end , he simply tells grace the mystery in its entirety anyway . meanwhile , the vampire leader fails to achieve the goals of centuries of scheming , because he chooses to refrain from action for two days after the kidnapping of the child . the only reason given for his decision to delay action is that he wants to savor his victory . the game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the holy grail . the kidnapping and vampires should have been omitted , replaced with a race against the vatican to uncover the mystery of rennes le château . since gabriel is portrayed more than once as reluctantly catholic , this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development . all in all , the game was a disappointing installment in the series , despite an improved interface and the return of tim curry as the voice of gabriel knight .
the night of the prom : the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic . and so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head-peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives . there really is no excuse for prom night . there is less than nothing original about it and i truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on imdb . the only part of my viewing that i enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts ' . it was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them . the plot was basically some guy going on a rampage . and the thing was , it was n't even a slightly exciting rampage . maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame robbie williams lookalike with a baseball cap , i might have sat there feeling slightly anxious . the fact that i cared less about the characters than i did about the colour of the cinema carpet did n't really add to the effect , either . and to make matters worse , the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and oblivious . the hotel staff did n't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave . i was incredibly surprised that the bitchy , stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was . she realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs , entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets . nice one . the worst thing was , i hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest . he really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening . shocking ! and the music , do n't even get me started . it was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral . i really wish that prom night was a joke . it was terrible and stupidly predictable . no one , in their right mind or otherwise , has any reason to see this film . mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation . if you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film , hear my plea . do n't do it . there are better things to spend six pounds on . like a sheet to play ghosts with .
had the original casting idea been kept ( hunting rutger , not ice-t ) , this movie might have worked . sadly , racism had to come into the picture ( literally ) and mess it up . the predominantly black production staff could n't allow the antagonist be black , so they swapped rutger 's and ice-t 's roles . this was only the start of the downward spiral of this film . ernest dickerson 's news-room approach to 'directing ' only verified that this was another affirmative-action job assignment . master shot , close up , close up . gads , 'who 's line is it anyway ' even uses more creative camera work . eric 's rewrite of 'the most dangerous game ' is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale , but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this . we are never given the reasons , other than `` no one will miss these people '' , why the leader ( re-written as rutger ) does these things . aside from a heart-felt performance by john mcginley , and a fair job by charles dutton , do not bother with this one . one small bit of trivia , there was a real drunk-driving accident during filming that injured f.murray abraham , and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the accident .
ok , i am not japanese . i do know a little about japanese culture , and a little less about japanese pop culture . other than that , i am spanish , i eat paella and i like black humor . good , with that point set , i can comment on the movie : i have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the japanese audiences , mamoru oshii is quite a good director- despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of talking head , and even that was curious and somehow interesting- and i am surprised he came up with this . it may just be one of those lost-in-translation cases , i am afraid it is , but as a european viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded english subtitles i just thought it was horrible . the jokes seemed bad , the script was overcooked- i mean , give the audience a break , and shut up a little you damn narrator- to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fast-paced speaking and absurd action . however , i thought the animation was really cool . the idea is great , and it is well exploited in those animated scenes . however , the eye-candy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbo-jumbo speech over still pictures . it just makes you want to fast forward to the next cut-out hysterical characters scene . i read mamoru oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this . the idea was good but horribly exploited . maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie , or maybe it will be more and more over-narrated scenes . but hell , if you thought talking head was dense , amazing lifes of fast food gifters will give cause you a stroke . of course , all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is european . probably this is totally useless to japanese people , maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation . maybe .
hi , everyone , if you saw `` singing in the rain , '' you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain . you also remember the dance number of donald o'connor , `` make 'em laugh . '' if you saw `` royal wedding , '' you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling . if you saw `` jailhouse rock , '' you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself . that is what is missing here . there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation . the closest was chuck mcgowan 's `` i can do that . '' the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film . richard attenborough was to blame for this failure . he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing . yelling at people auditioning for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment . michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy . he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at . it does not work here . the cast was good except for michael , of course . a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production , but someone should have thought about how to film it . next time they do one of these i hope they call me first . tom willett
i watched this movie as i liked the plot , a group of strangers are held captive trying to figure out how they 're connected . the setting and the premise were obviously influenced by the first ( and best ) saw movie & although there was n't much action the story moved at a relatively good pace . there was comedy relief ion the form of the two bickering 'alpha males ' and it was a welcome surprise ( for me anyway ) to see melissa joan hart has n't given up on acting yet . a few things let it down for me personally ; 1 . the paedophile was way over characterised making him get turned on by everything from children to dead bodies . 2 . mjh 's line about her cop ex 'getting her into this ' when in reality , he was the least deserving person to be there , he had n't knowingly contributed to the events leading up to their capture . 3 . the ending ..... what sort of movie just ends in the middle of something going on ? there was no resolution , no cliff hanger , no obvious end ... it just ends . and for that alone i dropped two stars off my rating . the first 2 points i would let slide but not the end !
i saw this movie in its own time period , when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life , but stamped your child as a bastard . in these days of 'single mothers ' that may seem very far-fetched , but it was very true . and i 'm not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering , either . between these two problems i had difficulty finding this movie funny . at that time i did n't know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had . i did know who betty hutton was , and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic . i loved `` bringing up baby '' , but i find this movie just embarrassing . i 'm sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked , but i was the one needing a drink after watching this again . the idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to 'get married ' and get pregnant just added to the misery . an entire town could turn on you under these circumstances , so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part . of course , shoot me , i do n't like `` it 's a wonderful life '' either .
really no reason to examine this much further because of a few very glaring and bias misleading statements . a perfect example is when the filmmaker claims `` saul '' or paul of tarus ( the writer of the book of hebrews he asserts ) has no idea jesus is or was a human being , this assertion is either purposely false as he accuses others of presenting , or he is ignorant of what `` the bible '' says . first we can examine his misleading claim about hebrews 8.4 ; which he shows a quote `` if jesus was on earth , he would not be a priest '' , hence right here he sets up the ignorant and unlearned viewer to accept his false premise .. why ? he does what most so called bible believing people he accuses of doing , the same .. that is taking things out of context . verse one of hebrews 8 is ; 1 .. '' now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : we have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens '' the context above is clearly speaking of a jesus who was on earth and ascended into heaven after his alleged resurrection . it has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take his out of context scripture . here he offers a foundation , that `` paul was not aware of a human jesus , but only one in `` heaven '' follow ? lets see if the filmmaker is being honest ; hebrews 7 ; 14 . `` for it is evident that our lord sprang out of judah ; of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood . '' heh , did n't the filmmaker just quote from the writer of hebrews trying to show the writer of that book has no knowledge of a `` human jesus '' ? it 's likely anyways paul did n't write hebrews , but i will not go into that here , but the film maker asserts paul did , and that is the premise of the point given here . it is not like this film maker does not make decent points in certain areas , he does , but he is engaging in the same blind bias of the religion he is bashing on . once he engages in these tactics , in my strong opinion , he loses credibility as the religion he picks out , and the film is no longer a documentary , but a personal opinion , and a bias of the film maker , nothing more , nothing less .
the first scene in 'problem child ' has a baby peeing into a nun 's face . for this movie , that 's witty . a nasty , mean-spirited 'comedy ' , it 's inept on so many levels it beggars belief . john ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell , and kudos to him for maintaining his dignity in the surrounding onslaught of one-note , annoying performances and puerile humour . and what the hell 's jack warden doing in this mess ? slackly directed by dennis dugan and obnoxious in its attempts to turn on the sentimentality when it 's done with the crudity , the movie is made so badly it 's quite a bizarre experience . but never mind all that . the lowlight of the whole thing is michael oliver , the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen  believe me , you will want to smack him right in the mouth .
i being of puertorican descent , had mixed fillings about this `` documentary '' . first i was offended that ms. perez compared senor campos to che guevarra . also just a point of fact , mr . john leguzaimo is not of puertorican descent.his parents came from columbia . whomever did research on this was not very accurate . i feel that the future of our race rests on education . this message should have been resounding throughout this film , education is our road to freedom and power i think any future endeavors of this production team should make this their focus.in my opinion , this film swayed toward an anti-american sentiment .
recap : doctor markov has developed a new theory how to produce energy , knowledge that might unbalance the world . he keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants out of the soviet union . kgb on the other side desperately wants the new technology . so , they sets a scheme in motion . during a rescue attempt to free markov , kgb steps in , takes markov to a secret location and lures him to reveal his secret by saying they are in sweden , and working for the un . as a backup , kgb kidnaps markov 's estranged daughter . cia now send their best agents , a team of ( swedish ? ) ninjas to thwart kgb and rescue markov and his daughter . comments : a cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing . the movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas . first off is that it is very dark , probably to conceal locations and bad effects , that some scenes are hard to comprehend . you ca n't see what is happening . the second thing that it is lacking is martial arts , despite being a ninja-movie . sure there are some , of quite poor quality , but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions . the automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of ammunition . and the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets while soviet guards die like flies . what does it have that speaks for it then ? the idea and ambition foremost . some actually , and especially for a swedish movie , decent action-scenes albeit not of martial arts . some nice slow-motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore . and some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode . mostly all parts that you look for in a b-movie . because it definitely is a b-movie , no mistake could be made there . but if you expect it , and watch it like a b-movie , it is entertaining . but do n't forget , it is not only a b-movie it is set in the eighties . some girls , for example , besides wearing ... lets say `` interesting '' clothes , have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup . in all , see for the cult status and the ambition . enjoy it , and then forget it . 4/10
this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression .. story writing is what movie making is about . incredible visual effects .. very good acting , especially from shue . everything is perfect .. except .. the story is just poor and so , everything fails . picture this , if you had the power to be invisible .. what would you do ? well , our mad scientist here ( played by kevin bacon ) could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women .. this is all his supposedly `` genius '' mind could think of . does he try to gain extra power ? no . he does n't even bother research a way to get back to being visible . the guy is basically a sex crazed maniac . add to that , the lab atmosphere , you have all these young guys .. throwing around jokes like they were in a bar .. if it was n't for all the white coats and equipment , you would think this is a bad imitation of `` cheers . '' very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the hollow man 's wolf . even as a thriller , the movie falls way short because most of the `` thrilling '' scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming `` this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me . '' if you read the actual book , while the scientist ( cane ) goes after women , there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character . in the movie , cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it . just sad .
what can i say ? i think i have to write `` spoiler alert '' and then `` reveal '' they used the f-word a lot in this movie - like in every two sentences . i did not like this movie at all - too much hints on sexual perversions , sidesteps and cheating . and that swearing was totally out the window . i gave this movie `` 3 '' and two of those points are for mira sorvino 's sexy movements on the dance floor .
it was difficult to sit through this horrible heretical adaptation of sherlock holmes . apparently matt frewer was cast because he is tall and skinny . his skull-like face made for a good zombie in the dawn of the dead remake , but as sherlock holmes he looks like a scarecrow . not only does frewer have a lanky lackadaisical walk that is hard to watch , but he looks uncomfortable in the stereotypical holmes overcoats that he is wearing . not only that , but while the coat is gray twill they apparently could not find a matching cap . so his cap is black and it looks shiny as if it were made of polyester . whatever the cap was made of , it looked very new and artificial . jeremy brett occasionally wore those traditional outfits , but brett did not have to dress-up like sherlock holmes in order to look the part . frewer on the other hand is painful to watch . even in the full `` holmes '' outfit , he does not carry himself like sherlock holmes . frewer 's cadaverous face grinning all the time as he spouts on and on in a very bad `` upper-crust '' british accent is painful to see and listen to . to say that frewer is overacting is an understatement . after he finishes each sentence with some kind of nasal hum , he then sneers as if that were some kind of british trait . when i started watching this i thought it might be a comedy featuring wishbone , the jack russell terrier . i thought frewer had been cast as some kind of foil for wishbone . but sadly , there is no dog in this movie except for frewer . wishbone would have made this movie a lot better . not only does frewer 's version of sherlock holmes never stop talking ( in that awfully artificial british nasal accent ) , but he is much to friendly and kind . frewer is always smiling at the witnesses he talks to , and he is so polite and courteous that he could be teaching at a charm school instead of being a sleuth . perhaps since this is a hallmark channel production , they are trying to make a children 's version of sherlock holmes ( wishbone was better at that , too ) that was kindler and gentler . whatever the point of frewer 's interpretation of sherlock holmes , it is flatter than a pancake , and easily the worst version of sherlock holmes that i have ever seen ( including the previous worst , by charlton heston ) . overall , the tone of this film is awful . it reminded me of a typical episode of barnaby jones or murder she wrote or diagnosis murder . all the suspects over-acted suspiciously and glared at the victims before they were killed . holmes and watson are explaining every clue to each other during the entire movie . even on murder she wrote there is less exposition . this sherlock holmes does not even compare very well to jim rockford of the rockford files and it is miles below columbo . the awful dialog is probably the fault of the writer . it is obvious that who ever wrote this script has very little familiarity with sherlock holmes , especially the bbc version with jeremy brett . this movie has all of the atmosphere of an episode of little house on the prairie . the fact that the actors seem to be smirking when they enunciate their lines in their fake accents does not help . the only minor bright spot is ken walsh who plays doctor watson with some dignity . walsh does not ham it up compared to frewer , and when he is often interviewing witnesses , his demeanor and conversational style are much more natural and credible . unfortunately , the rest of the cast is amateurish , and the visual clues they give by glaring and making faces at each other ( to show they are suspicious ) is something that i had not seen in any modern movie .
one : richard pryor and jackie gleason , two great comics turned into saps for a bratty kid . they 've both sold themselves out in this one , worse than pryor 's character . two : horrible , overly sentimental script that could have been used in a harold lloyd movie its so cliched . three : choice of a black actor as the toy ; the racial subtext of this is unbearable , as its never addressed . there 's no message here , pryor 's part could have been played by any comedic actor . four : that kid ... i wish i could go back in time and prevent him from ever acting ... that would mean movies like this one and kid co. might not have been made ... and my childhood would have been free of their mind-warping power . so if you want to watch a couple of great comics defile themselves in a sickly sweet kiddie flick , go ahead . if you want to see them in something good , see pryor 's old standup act and gleason in something better , like the honeymooners .
the question , when one sees a movie this bad , is not necessarily , `` how did a movie this bad get made ? '' or even , `` why did i see this awful in the first place ? '' but , `` what have i learned from this experience ? '' here 's what i learned : - just because the `` rules '' of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years does n't mean someone wo n't go ahead and make a movie that uses all of them , without a shred of humor or irony . - if your movie has to be described as * * loosely * * based on the video game , you have script problems . - the black character may not always die first , but the asian character does always know kung-fu . - while you may be proud that you figured out how to do the `` the matrix effect '' on a budget , that does n't necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea . - being ron howard 's brother does not guarantee choice roles . - whenever a scene does n't edit together , just use some footage from the video game , no one will notice . - if your cousin 's rap-metal band offers to write your movie 's theme for free , politely decline . - zombie movies are not about people killing zombies . they 're about zombies killing people , preferably in the most gruesome way possible . that 's what makes them scary . - white people who can pay $ 1600 to get to a rave deserve to die . - if you find an old book , it will tell you everything you need to know . anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks , `` what was that ? '' or , `` where are we ? '' - bare breasts are not horror movie panacea . - a helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with sega magically transforms your movie from `` student film '' to `` major studio release '' . try it ! - just because you can name-drop all three `` living dead '' movies , that does not make you george romero . or even paul w. s. anderson . i 've seen worse movies , but only because i 've seen `` mortal kombat : annihilation . ''
wow , what a total let down ! the fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous . the special effects were a direct rip-off of `` the ring . '' the story ? was there one ? not in my opinion .. just a bunch of flashy imaging . the entire film was a boring , stupid , mess . i guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns . however , this is the worst horror film i have seen in years . and that buffy chick ? well , she 's a bad actress ! as plastic as barbie and just as talented .. no , wait , that would be an insult to the talents of barbie ! i suppose many kiddies helped this film at the box office as it was pg-13 , and had it been rated r , it would have bombed imo ! stupid movie !
this is not horror , as the first part was : this is ( `` campy '' ) light and humorous entertainment . like in so many sequels , the action starts right away with no explanations . but there 's boobs , so i do n't complain . and real boobs that is . if i understand correctly , those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in u.s. of a . which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is pamela `` bruce 's sister '' springsteen . this can not be thought without the first movie , so i compare this to it . again there is too small clothing ( mainly pants ) and funny hair , it 's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in . again there is really strange characters , this time even more visibly `` pathological '' ones . especially the personnel of the camp . it 's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp . people are older : most of the actors must be at least 25 , but i think they 're supposed to be 16 or something . some `` methods '' used by the evil dyke are quite unpleasant . actually this movie do n't have much in common with the first part , and this is worse than it in every way .
absolute garbage , worse fight scenes than a 20 year old van damme movie or american ninja etc . truly dire acting , not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden sculptures . watch it just for how truly bad this film is , it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie , i do n't have much love for this movie as it was n't born in the 80s . if you like real fight movies then check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector , those are proper martial arts films . have a laugh and watch this today you may see the unintenional humour at how grim it is .
german filmmaker ulli lommel has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible : he 's unseated fellow teuton uwe boll for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever made . lommel is truly the ed wood of the new millennium . this film is as shoddy and laughable as the best-worst of ew . i am both proud and embarrassed to say that i watched it in toto , morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set . the answer is : subterranean ; lommel dug a pit and buried it . the fun begins with the cast of international nobodies . only someone who has lived in los angeles , where every auto mechanic , doctor and mailman is an actor or screenwriter waiting to be discovered , could easily understand how lommel managed to find so many wannabe actors willing to spew his ridiculous dialog with a straight face . the main character , a villainous beat cop , is played by a german actor with a thick german accent . aside from being a serial killer , he is also the oldest beat cop in la . despite the fact that he stops innocent women drivers and takes them into custody , then drags them into his home ( which inexplicably is the top floor of a furniture warehouse ) , and does all this in plain sight of his rookie partners , the lapd refuses to investigate , going so far as to physically attack one of his accusers in a ninja style raid on his apartment . the sets are excruciatingly bad . the production designer 's budget apparently included just enough money for a can of paint ; enough to paint `` precinct 707 '' on a cardboard wall . since the actors were obviously unpaid non-professionals -- a sad assortment of european emigres ( possibly deportees if they acted in their native lands ) , bimbos , mimbos , and desperate middle-aged women -- and since little if any money was spent on sets , special efx , locations or other production value , it is only fair to mention that they did spring for a few genuine-looking police uniforms . sadly , they could n't afford a police car ; the uniformed cops cruise the streets in a shiny new mercury rental . more than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our deranged german lapd officer and the futile efforts of two young rookies to stop him . one of these young actors is especially pitiable because he 's the only actor in this whole mess with even a vague shot at a real career in the movies . the other fits right in , with a rockabilly hairdo and tortured brando posing that needs to be seen to be appreciated . the latter part of the film is where the title gets its zombie , as the victims of our killer are resurrected after he murders a girl who had just visited some voodoo priestesses to have a protective spell put on her . do n't ask why a girl from romania would resort to voodooism in anticipation of being murdered , just accept lommel 's logic and enjoy the absurd ride . after much prolonged hand-clawing out of straw-covered roadside graves , the zombie girls manage to make their appearance . they look exactly as they did before death , maybe even prettier , with black glamor make-up generously airbrushed around their eyes . looking nothing like zombies , they look more like high fashion models ready for the runway . at this point in the movie lommel borrows a creative note from his lauded countryman boll , and injects large doses of cheesy euro-trash techno into the soundtrack . we 're talking prehistoric electronic bumblebee noise . stuff they might have played in an ibiza disco when lommel was still young enough to shake his booty . unlike other zombies , lommel 's girls speak and function as normal ... er , i mean , as they did before becoming zombified . this gives our auteur ample opportunities to shower us with more of his golden dialog . yes , a golden shower it is . i wo n't spoil anything by revealing the shock ending . all i can say is it 's perfectly in tune with the rest of this masterpiece . the spirit of ed wood lives on ... or should i say his geist .
dick foran and peggy moran , who were so good together in the mummy 's hand , return for this very minor universal horror offering . but this time , instead of having wallace ford as the comedic sidekick `` babe , '' we get fuzzy knight substituting as a silly buddy named `` stuff '' . but the results are nowhere near as charming , and the scare level is virtually nil . dick is a businessman who gets the idea of spearheading a treasure hunt on a remote island inside a spooky old castle . peggy is one of the gang who comes along for the ride . but there is a tall and skinny john carradine lookalike in a black cape and big hat known as `` the phantom '' who crashes the party in pursuit of the buried fortune himself . this `` phantom '' is not very mysterious , and no effort is made to even try and keep his rather average guy face in the shadows to create any tension or spookiness . it 's always nice to see perky moran , but otherwise you can chalk this up as one of universal 's instantly forgettable misfires .
i ca n't believe that none of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes . it 's as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent . my biggest problem with the movie is that it does n't seem to condemn these assaults - as in , the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions , and neither does anyone else . one man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him , but he is reprimanded only with `` you can not force a woman to love you '' rather than `` you should never force a woman sexually , you jerk '' ... from a woman 's point of view , the movie is a let down . it sort of `` throws a bone '' to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders , but the movie is much more defined by the romance - which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power , with men dominating the woman they love . this amazing martial arts fighter does n't use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers . she never even makes them apologize - rather , she seems apologetic . overall , a depressing and upsetting movie , with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes , but not as good as hero by a long shot .
this is probably one of the worst films i have ever seen . the events in it are completely random and make little or no sense . the fact that there is a sequel is so sickening i may come down with a case of cabin fever ( i 'm so sorry ) . i describe it as bug being smooshed to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together . e.g kevin the pancake loving karate kid is just freakishly weird on its own , then there 's the cop who is slightly weird and perverted , then the drug addict , then there 's the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help . then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down . then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on kevin the karate kid . its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film . there is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love eli roth , even that did not make me like this film . hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do . boycott cabin fever 2 ! ! ! ! !
no one should ever try to adapt a tom robbins book for screen . while the movie is fine and the performances are good , the dialogue , which works well reading it , is crap when spoken . or , to put it another way , no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone else 's name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl . overall , the movie feels like a badly-adapted cliffs notes to the book - most of the parts have been hacked down to a fifth of their size in the book , in terms of backstory and current story , and the ending is wildly ( and unpleasantly ) different from that of the book . most of the plots from the book have gotten lost , including the one that makes everything make sense at the end , and there 's more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say `` huh ? '' not a worthy effort , unfortunately - the script should have been read , compared to the book , burned , and all the actors sent off to do something far better . i admire gus van sant tremendously , but not even someone of his calibre could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries .
( ( nb : spoiler warning , such as it is ! ) ) first off , this is a teen slasher flick -- the spam-in-a-cabin genre , as joe bob briggs piquantly put it . if you 're looking for roshambo , this is n't it and was n't going to be it . i 'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography , directing or acting performances . secondly , this was n't zuniga 's first horror flick , it was her first screen appearance period , cinema , tv , whatever . for what it is worth ; neither is daphne zuniga susan sarandon or katherine hepburn . thirdly , you have to give even a lame slasher flick props . sure , it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre : any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof , and the harvest time is now . except this one gives the chop to the sweet , virginal protagonist as well ! now there is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions ! interesting that this was said ingenue 's only film role . another one hit wonder , except that term gives the lass too much credit . ( then again , this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one-movie actors in history . of the nineteen credited actors , a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film . three appeared in one other movie by the same producers . only one other besides zuniga has as many as six screen credits . what was this , the has been and never were mutual aid society ? ) granted , i saw this a long time ago on late night cable when i was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again , but i see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with joanne . 2/10 .
david chase 's `` the sopranos '' is perhaps the most over-praised television show in recent memory . not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion , it 's devoid of a soul . as anyone reading likely knows already , james gandolfini * is * tony soprano , a big , fat a * * hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b * tch of a wife , and two bratty , sh * t-brained kids living in - you guessed it - the armpit of america ( that 's new jersey , by the way ) . not only is tony a womanizing adulterer , he 's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag , with a crew of `` saturday night live '' skit-worthy caricatures for subordinates . it 's not the fact that tony is a piece of sh * t mobster that offends me ( and apparently only me ) . allowing characters to be who and what they are , without judgment , is something american tv hardly allows . but chase - and his entourage of money-gorged , emmy-gored writers - have not simply allowed us to observe tony and his crew as they behave , nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action / reaction reality of ( even obviously fictionalized ) organized crime ( a la `` the godfather '' ) . instead , chase glorifies and endorses his characters ' greedy , violent , and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that tony , his wife , and even his hair-brained psychologist do week after week ( or should i say month after month . or is it year after year ? it seems like the show 's paltry 13-episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse ) . much has been made of the series ' refusal to adhere to `` network '' structure , with plot lines that go nowhere , and characters that pop-up and disappear like backyard vermin . but if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure , why does it always feel like i 'm watching a soap-opera ? tired mob clichés , bored housewives , self-serving , irredeemable characters and plots that go nowhere . more than ever , i can see why so many americans of italian heritage are p * ssed at this show . it 's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book ( danté 's `` inferno '' springs to mind ) . people on imdb love to claim that there 's nothing good on television , and therefore `` the sopranos '' is a breath of fresh air . are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch `` the shield '' ? ( it 's included in basic , ya know ) . how about the ( still good ) `` the west wing '' ? or the brilliantly acted ( if erratically written ) `` boston legal '' ? what about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades , `` arrested development '' ? and lest we forget that we live in an age of dvds - nobody * has * to watch * anything * new . i 'd much rather shell out $ 40 for an over-priced boxed set of , well , pretty much * anything * , than give hbo $ 10 a month ( or $ 80 a dvd set ! ) to continue to prove how much of a hack-factory it can be . you want good television ? watch `` homicide : life on the street . '' or `` murder one '' . or `` picket fences '' . or even chase 's prior show , `` northern exposure . '' if you 're already among `` the sopranos '' 's legion of brain-washed fans and critics , it 's too late for you . but if not , leave tony and his worthless kin where they all belong - rotting with the fishes . ( `` sleeping '' would be way too kind )
please humour me if you will , for a minute while i read you the back of the alley cat vhs box . it says that : in this part of the city every street is a dead end- on every corner something to buy- in every alley another way to die- to survive you 're got to be the best- just like the alley cat . alley cat- this lady owns the night . on the streets where even the predators become victims she knows how to survive- cross her and you 've run out of luck . alley cat- this animal is aroused . now is n't that one of the most pathetic blurbs you 've ever heard in your life ? whoever wrote that must be insane if they thought such a awful description could tempt us into viewing the video . yet unfortunately , whichever faceless individual was responsible for that tragic use of english was doing their job only too well .. the movie contained within the little plastic case is as bad as it sounds , and then some . karin mani plays the title role , and the script basically tells her during every given scene to either a ) pout like a goldfish b ) kick male butt or c ) show off her feminine 'attributes ' . no complaints about the latter , but in terms of the other two .. let 's just say she is n't much of an actress , and is even less convincing as a martial arts expert . but even meryl streep with cynthia rothrock 's body ( what a scary thought ) would fail to save this movie . the unfolding of the plot is boring beyond belief , as we get one ineptly directed fight sequence after enough , pausing only for hysterical courtroom shenanigans and the occasional gag-inducing love scene with the interestingly named robert torti . the camera-work also follows a similar path of shame , with far too many unneeded close-ups and continuity errors abound . the part that i think really sums this scum-bucket of a movie up is where our heroine is sexually assaulted , and finds herself testifying in front of a corrupt judge while her rich-kid rapist leers at her from the box . not only does he get off scot-free despite the overwhelming evidence against him , but she herself is then jailed for daring to protest about the verdict in front of his honour . behind bars , she then has a group shower , a lesbian crush , a couple of cat-fights and a nice , sweaty game of volleyball before being released on bail to continue her battle . this ten-minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie , and the screenplay grinds to a halt to encompass it . i can only imagine the producers wanted to add a bit more t & a to the mix , and came up with this needless sub-plot as a means to achieving that end . which kinds of begs the question , is this an exploitation film , or a serious drama ? neither , is my response to that .. it is n't sleazy or camp enough to appeal to fans of troma-style cinema , and it certainly does n't make the grade as an exploration of one woman 's fight against the system .. purely because it is so appallingly made . so who on earth would want to see it ? lunatics , i guess .. or imdb reviewers who stay up till 3pm and watch any old rubbish on the box while trying to get to sleep . sadly on this occasional i failed , and the horrors will stay with me for quite some time . do n't make the same mistake i did . have a hot milk , or something .. 1/10
this is an extremely boring film . if you grew up during the vietnam was , as i did , then you 've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now . but what really makes this film boring is the narration by director carlton sherwood . the majority of the film is shot with sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation . if you 're old enough to remember vietnam , then you wo n't find anything new here . there is no new evidence to condemn john kerry or new evidence worthy of another documentary on vietnam . younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see george butler 's excellent film going upriver ! stolen honor was clearly meant to be a hatchet job on john kerry , but it fails miserably at accomplishing that goal .
`` the man in the attic '' is a movie set in the 1910s . it is inspired by a true story . unfortunately , it 's a story that really did n't need to be told . looking at the box , the people responsible for packaging the movie tried their best to make this film appear steamy and erotic . they use terms such as `` illicit passion '' , `` forbidden affair '' , and `` unlimited pleasures '' . they even show a picture of neil patrick harris ( little doogie howser , m.d . ) holding a gun ! the story involves krista , played by anne archer . she is unhappily married to a gentleman who owns his own business . edward ( harris ) is an employee of her husband 's company . krista and edward end up falling in love with each other . the supposedly `` shocking '' part of the movie is this : krista 's husband finds out about the affair and forbids them from ever seeing each other again . so what do they decide to do ? krista ends up having edward live up in their attic . wow ! krista ends up seeing someone else and edward gets extremely jealous . so on and so on and so on . `` the man in the attic '' does n't cover any new territory . it 's a showtime original picture , which explains why the stars are a couple of b-list actors and both appear briefly in the buff .
after seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema , i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller , setting it in the competitive world of computer companies . the all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good . but when i did n't go to watch it in it 's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss . patiently i waited for it 's dvd release , then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening 's viewing . the anticipation on the way home was far better than the film . for a start the direction is appalling . there 's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself , so he can appear in the film . i would n't be rushing out to employ him in the future . secondly the lead role is completely miscast as ryan phillipe . phillipe normally the cool character as in cruel intentions and way of the gun but in this he 's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he 's running and having geeky friends , but he just does n't look right . the female stars , rachel leigh cook and clare forlani do n't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests . the only highlight of the film is tim robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it 's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along . the final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you do n't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the dvd . causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story .
the only words you need fear more than joe don baker if your thinking of watching a film are greydon clark , and if they are both there , run for your life . however this is a very funny film because they actually take themselves seriously ! it starts out bad and goes downhill from there , repeated scenes , the good the bad and the ugly like shootout will have you rolling on the floor with laughter .yes , he 's the best deputy sheriff in texas , tracking a mafia hit-man to malta as only he can . he makes his own rules , does things his own way , all the while wearing cowboy boots and sidearms cowboy style . you want to see a bad but funny film ? go ahead on , its your move !
i watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here . it was fairly easy to watch ( at 3am ) . it had good casting - kevin dillon 's role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable - he was both charasmatic and chilling . the rest of the main characters were n't so bad either . this is your typical stalker/suspense movie . a married couple can not conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help . a sociopathic `` genetic material '' donor fixates on the recipients and , in typical stalker form , intrudes into their lives . as i said , most of the movie was fairly good .. we see `` conan '' grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother . of course things do n't work out for him the way he planned . not a bad plot line . but , the last 15 minutes were just horrible . i am pretty tolerant with movies ( especially at 3am ! ) .. but , i was just amazed at how bad the ending was written . i actually scoffed outloud ! all in all , not the worst movie i 've seen , but i would n't be able to sit through it again ( unless i skipped the ending ) . the only redeaming quality here was kevin dillon 's role - - one of the best serial killers ever . try looking around at the other channels before watching this .. but , if nothing better is on , i 'd give it a try .. = )
this was n't what i wanted to see . i bought this on dvd and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment . heres what i did n't like : 1 they were shooting at the father 2 the tribes was really annoying 3 the dinosaurs ( mostly ) looked to faked 4 the bad scientist well he was annoying 5 the picture quality on the dvd was really bad what i did like : 1 the music by jerry goldsmith . this music is really great . i have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie . sadly the sound quality is not good , but its ok for its time . 2 the first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe . 3 baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing 4 that funny scene with the tent . 5 the children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses .
i was intrigued to see how a little-seen 2008 film had somehow won the oscar for best picture of 2009 and thus went to see the hurt locker . sadly , all i got for the two hours invested was the grim confirmation that this film had won awards purely for off-the-screen reasons . the direction and visual style of this film is some of the weakest you will ever see . when it 's not busy being yet another bourne identity homage with dire , annoying `` shaky cam '' visuals , it shows off all the hallmarks of a second rate daytime soap opera in terms of lensing . the `` plot '' is threadbare , the characterizations are about as well developed as rejected beetle bailey comic strip ideas and the dialogue - on the instances where the film gives up on being `` minimalist '' and for no apparent reason turns one or two soldiers into right chatterboxes - is some of the worst ever recorded . in fairness , the actors do the best they can in the circumstances , just not enough to obscure how bad the project is . the whole film has the feel of it being intended as some kind of `` mockumentary '' that they clocked was bereft of humour and thus re-edited as best they could so as to pass it off as a serious drama . if you spend two hours on this film they are two hours you will never get back , and two hours wasted that you will regret for the rest of your life .
this movie could have been a decent b-movie if 3/4 of the the movie was n't so much focusing on the sex scenes . i mean , he 's a sex addict , and i 'm sure that there 's a lot more that goes on with sex addicts outside of having sex on a constant basis . michael des barres did a good job considering what all he had to do , which was n't much . at one point or another , one would have to laugh at him , because his character was so pitiful . nastassja kinski was alright in her role as the concerned sex therapist , she could 've of done more though and i 'm not suggesting her having sex . the person that stood out the most to me in this movie was rosanna arquette in her convincing role as the loving and concerned wife . there 's something about beautiful inside and out that strongly appeals to me . she played that role and as you watched the movie , you start to feel bad for her . `` diary of a sex addict '' while not oscar material or a modern classic to anyone 's standards , is quite informative and does a fair job in showing you how one 's personal demons can take over and ruin the very things in life you think highly of .
i doubt jigsaw was hip even at the time , the whole lsd theme married to a murder mystery being a patently obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixties counterculture . the dated aspect aside , jigsaw suffers from many problems , including overwrought acting , silly and stilted dialogue , lsd flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 seconds , a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is , on paper , a great vehicle to do just that , and an ending that is so trite and predictable ( not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows ) that the climax is actually an anti-climax . if it was a better movie , we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment , but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the improbabilities viewers might otherwise overlook . i saw jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night tv fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill somebody 's insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out . at very best , a three out of 10 .
yet another die hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains how many more of these god awful cheaply ( and badly ) made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980 's and early 1990 's are there still lurking out there ? for the record ( not that you will care really ) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of die hard , under siege and speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability . the non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses , the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son . the supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between florida and mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in new zealand ! the acting is as wooden as the deck , the script woeful , the one liners predictable , the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through . there seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the dvd bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere ( although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a dvd release yet but give it time ! ) is there any chance of something at least half decently made , semi believable and most important original ? ! ? no , i thought not ..
where to start . the film started out pretty well , but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock . the horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in . it just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by . the actors gave an average performance in this movie however , i got a bit bored of vinny jones constant scowling in the film . as the film dragged on , and take my word for it , it dragged on , it just got more and more far fetched . * * * spoiler alert * * * spoiler alert * * * spoiler alert * * * just when i thought the film could not get any worse , towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up , just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all . it turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end . the ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was . once the lead role disposes of vinny jones , he becomes the new killer . in closing , this film made creep look like the best horror film ever made . i gave it 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie ! !
i have never read the book '' a wrinkle in time '' . to be perfectly honesty , after seeing the movie , do i really want to ? well , i should n't be reviewing this movie i 'll start off with that . next i 'll say that the tv movie is pretty forgettable . do you know why i say that ? because i forgot what happens in it . i told you it was forgettable . to be perfectly honest , no tv movie will ever be better than `` merlin '' . how do i describe a tv movie ? i have never written a review for one before . well , i 'll just say that they usually have some celebrities . a wrinkle in time includes only one . alfre woodard ( or woodward , i am not sure ) , the oscar winner . the film has cheesy special effects , a mildly interesting plot , scenes that make you go `` wtf '' . the movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go '' wtf '' . what did i expect ? it 's a tv movie . they usually are n't good . as is this one . a wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a big time waster . to top it off , you 'll most likely forget about it the second it 's over . well , maybe not the second it 's over . but within a few minutes . a wrinkle in time : * / * * * *
i did n't even knew this movie existed until shortly after seeing blade : trinity , i was messing around on the trinity board when i saw some user mention how the wes craven series is a lot better then the 'crap ' that 's blade , so i did my quick research : checked the scores on imdb & rottentomatoes for dracula : ascension , and somewhere along the search i found out that this is a sequel to dracula 2000 . i also noticed that within the wes craven dracula boards there was a real strong following for this movie which is a big contradiction to the scores i was seeing . now let 's take a quick personal recap here . i remember seeing dracula 2000 , and i remember not liking it at all , and then seeing the scores of dracula : ascension just lowered my expectations even more , but then again , i 'm the type of person that truly needs to watch the movie myself ( any movie ) so that i can form my own opinion . a couple of things i went in knowing when i started watching this movie was that it 's low budget , so because of that , i 'm going to have to ignore a lot of the v/fx and just figure it 's going to compensated by story & acting , i was also slightly impressed by some of the casting in this movie ( jason london , roy schieder & jason scott lee ) oh geez this movie was cheesy ! but cheesy can be entertaining at least , i found it pretty fricken laughable , the bad audio synch from the re-recording of dialogue in a few scenes , the stupidity of the characters in this movie . sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things , luke even had a book on it , but did it prevent them from wanting to purposely get 'infected ' ? nope , this is worst then slasher flicks where the girl has to get out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing more than a towel on . i also must 've blinked at some point , because i 'm not sure how 'dracula ' got clothes on his body , especially since he 's big wild and angry & i figure if i was in that situation , i would n't want to be the one dressing him . so the movie ends like any middle movie of a trilogy it does n't , instead it 's a 'cliff hangar ' where i now get to wait for the 3rd installment 'legacy ' . oh the entertainment value of cheesy movies .
frank capra 's creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film . while it has a few charming moments , and many wonderful performers , capra 's outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story , broadway bill ( 1934 ) , is downright shoddy . it is understandable that he would re-use footage from the climactic horse race , which is thrilling . but he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors , then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice , for example , that ward bond is 14 years older ! unless you want to see one of the last appearances of oliver hardy , skip this one and watch broadway bill instead .
this is a mildly interesting late 80 's gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood . if you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this . the acting is awful and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between gory slug attacks , but the movie is n't a complete waste of time . the special effects are actually quite good , and the gore is well done . it reminded me of the remake of the blob , probably because of the sliminess of it all . all in all , you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time , but i would n't suggest seeing this movie unless you 've got a strong stomach and are into this sort of thing .
i went to see this film based on the review by siskel and ebert ; not only did i get duped , but i took some friends along , and had to spend the rest of the day profusely apologizing for making them sit through this pointless crap . after this , i never went to see a movie based solely on siskel & ebert 's advice .
oh dear . good cast , but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task . even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right . im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times . the main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue , that made some people in the film annoying . it may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task . and the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film . overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me , but i 'm sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good . sorry .
i have n't seen it in over twenty years . oj was the bus driver , arte johnson was the tour guide , lorenzo was the kidnapper . yea , lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain , a natural . i think i watched it back then most for oj , who i had seen towering inferno and cassandra crossing , but also to see arte johnson . i was a little bored that johnson was so serious . and yes , it shifted plots . in reading other posts , i remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl , but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue . i was going , a stamp ? if it came on as a late movie , i would probably record it to check it out again , but i would n't be nostalgic over it . not yet anyway . there are better movies from the seventies like this to check out .
offering a killer combo of terrible writing , terrible acting and terrible direction , it 's a tossup whether kinjite : forbidden subjects is offensively bad or just hilariously bad . it 's almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest , seediest cannon film . as if a glance at a cast list including characters like 'lesbian pedophile , ' 'perverted gentleman , ' 'porno actress ' were n't enough , it 's your only chance to see charles bronson 's cop throw a lowlife on a bed and grab a dildo - but do n't worry , it 's okay , as the offscreen screams make clear he 's only torturing him for information . after all , even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice catholic daughter , he 's a nice catholic cop who regularly brings local catholic priest william o'connell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice - or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine . but then that 's what you get for telling him `` look , i think you 're a little bit unstable . '' still , when later offered a bribe , he may snarl `` i 'd like to shove this up your ass , but i do n't want to get my hands dirty , '' he 's clearly learned where to draw the line : instead , he just makes him eat a $ 25,000 watch and sets fire to his cadillac . the anal obsession even follows through to the film 's title : despite the poster featuring a naked japanese girl on a porn film set , the film 's only direct example of kinjite/forbidden subjects , as alex hyde white 's english teacher explains to a group of japanese businessmen , is , er talking about your bowel movements in polite society . bronson is n't just too old for this , as the opening fight makes only too clear , he 's too old for love interest peggy lipton , and she looks old enough to have grown-up kids . a better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material , here 's he 's given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous reactionary quirks . when he 's not widening the circles of suspects he 's accidentally dropping them to their death off the sides of buildings . he 's definitely not a p.c . copper , with a special loathing for the japanese - as if it was n't bad enough that they 're buying up american businesses , what 's worse , they double-park on a public thoroughfare ! no racial minority goes unassaulted , be they black pimp or pakistani hotel clerk , no cop cliché unrecycled , be it a boss who bangs his fist on the table or a dead meat partner ( perry lopez and his spectacularly bad hair dye that 's so prominent it deserves screen billing all its own ) . the twin plot strands - bronson 's l.a. cop trying to take down juan hernandez 's pimp who deals in underage girls and james pax 's porn-obsessed japanese businessman  take forever to intertwine , and then in the most unlikely of ways : after copping a feel of bronson 's daughter on a bus ( `` some oriental guy touched my holy of holies ! `` ) , in the film 's idea of poetic justice pax finds his own daughter kidnapped by hernandez . you half expect the writer to pop his head round the corner of the screen and say , `` how d'ya like them apples ? '' somewhere underneath all the laziness is the germ of a good idea even if it is too muddily developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is , but the execution is pure rising sun : the archie bunker version , shot like out-takes from an r-rated 80s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy dockside shoot-'em-up-and-blow'em-up finale that sees a small army of machine-gunning sidekicks suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count . the last of bronson 's mostly bad to in different collaborations with j. lee thompson  and sadly thompson 's last film as director - it 's a poor signoff for two undervalued players who increasingly never seemed to be that discerning about what pictures they said yes to .
to be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the exact opposite . i realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a muslim uses s a word like this in real life it does n't mean it is a terrorist thing . it also show 's how people give the muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype , by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad muslims out it does n't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time , like how hard it was for amair to get on a plane and how he used words like `` blow up '' or yaser saying we 'll blow away the competition , and people took it the wrong way . being a muslim i know that stuff like this do n't usually happen , but they do and many people think bad things about muslims or afghanistan or iraq , its not right things are not like that . people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act . i am glad a show like this came on the air . there are many shows that piotr muslim people as terrorists , many people do find them funny to my opioion it is ok to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair , but it is done to often and really gives muslin people a bad name .
very outdated film with awful , cliché-ridden and mawkish dialog and a very poor construction . in addition , cassavetes and falk overact constantly . a pseudo `` good movie '' . it takes no time to discover how catastrophic this intellectual turkey is . the first scene is a total bore , filled with histrionics and hysteric exchanges . the sound is horrible . camera movements are without imagination as is the building of characters . no poetry , no subtle psychology , no interesting shots . the actors smoke constantly and we see ads for beer beverages . very cheap , indeed . ( one exception : ned beattie '' s nice and simple way of playing the hit man ) .
`` attack of the killer tomatoes '' consists mostly of rambling , poorly assembled footage in search of a movie . the plot makes no sense , and the various characters drop in and out of the picture with no explanation at all . watching this silly spoof , you get the feeling than so many other comments have captured so accurately : that it 's easy to make a cheap , low-quality film and then use the `` parody '' angle as an excuse for its cheapness and low quality ( in one scene , female swimmers are terrified of tomatoes that are floating near them ; how far can `` suspension of disbelief '' go - even in a parody ? ) . the title song is great , though . ( * 1/2 )
keenan ivory wayans is probably one of the worst directors , i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films . he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie . scary movie 2 was ok too but everything else keenan has made are real disasters . avoid such titles like do n't be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood ..... i know , what a title ! ! ! obviously this film too , just anything that has keenans name in the credits . it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh . just trust me on this , maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films ........ 1/10 ....... j.d seaton
the writers and producers of this little outing have plummeted new depths of depravity . did writer 's block set in so badly , or had ideas dried up so much , that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van , and then promptly throws the excrement at the car behind ( mind you at least this summarises what this film is worth ) . we had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint , as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting ; once would have sufficed ... we got the message ! this really is taking toilet humour to another level ! had the script and acting been better then i could have easily forgotten that i was watching a film shot entirely on low budget video . this was a fairly original storyline , with a clever ( the only ) piece of direction in that we only ever got to take the viewpoint from inside of the van ; thus making it feel much more real . we never got to see inside any other locations , such as the store or the field where several of the women disappeared , and this could have added much needed tension . the script was dire . lines like : ' i do n't feel too good ... i want to go home ' after one of the girls has been pursued by a psychopath ; subjected to rape by a screwdriver and shot at , seem a little undercooked . the acting was diabolical ( apart from the maniac ) . did all the main 5 actresses in this learn acting by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike ! the sound was so bad that i had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on . the director seemed to have an easy job in this . it seems that the only direction he must have given was : 'scream girls ' . and as for the screaming ...... if you watch this please be sure to have some paracetamol at the ready !
this film is pure , distilled , unadulterated boredom . i knew nothing of it before i entered the dark room , took my seat . i was seduced by the `` mysterious and suspenseful '' blurb on the poster i suppose . also , lena headey is nice and unconventionally sexy , and richard jenkins is always a reliable guy to have around , so the cast seemed reasonable . it may have been his name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on . i should 've gone to see valkyrie for the second time instead . the thin plot revolves around headley 's gina mcvey , her boyfriend , her father , her sister and her sister 's husband who for some reason are being stalked , in a very louche and unenthusiastic manner , by their evil doppelgangers who emerge from mirrors that mysteriously smash . there could be a great film behind this idea ( not exactly an original idea , mind you , but still ... ) and in fact , if the filmmakers had shorn away all the supporting cast and simply stuck to headey 's character 's story , the broken could 've made a reasonable 20-minute short . as it is , it is desperately unmotivated and boring , and terribly inconsistent . for instance , in one scene , a mirror smashes on its own in a room housing all the main characters ; they look puzzled but quickly forget about it . in another scene , a mirror smashes in an empty room , and a doppelganger is visible as she `` steps out '' of the shards left hanging on the wall . so why did the first mirror smash if no creepy crawly was to come crawling out ? just for a little thrill ? there are far too many scenes of the characters in the dimly-lit london flats , peering around corners cos they thought they heard something , but seeing nothing there and moving on . we begin to wonder , why does n't this malevolent doppelgang actually ever want to try to scare them ? scare the characters and you have a chance of scaring the audience . but we , the audience , will need to start threatening each other , in the darkness of the theater , if we want to have any thrills during the broken . by the way , once we 've spent time with these evil doubles , we are totally bemused as to why anyone should be expected to be frightened of them - they just stand around , blank looks on their faces , perhaps totally harmless after killing their others . there are some nice moods and touches throughout , and i dare say director sean ellis could fashion a genuinely stylish and suspenseful mystery movie if he was to hire an imaginative screenwriter next time .
first things first : i 'm not a conservative . and even though i would never refer to myself as a liberal or a democrat , i was opposed to the war in iraq from day one . i think it 's safe to say john cusack and i would probably see eye-to-eye on politics , in fact , i 'm sure we 'd become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great adam curtis ' bbc docs are . my point is this : do n't discredit this review by thinking i 'm not a part of the choir cusack is preaching to in war , inc . there 's no question wi 's politics are tailored to appeal to my demographic , but the problem is , the tailoring is substandard and the the film cusack co- wrote , produced and stars in , fits worse than a cheap suit . as they say `` the road to hell is paved with good intentions . '' cusack , his co-writers , director joshua seftel and even the actors involved , no doubt had every intention of making an anti- war film every bit as biting and funny as robert altman 's m * a * s * h , unfortunately for the viewer , they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as michael moore 's canadian bacon . the current state of us politics , foreign policy and the war `` effort '' is already absurd and , as a result , tragic , pathetic and , regrettably comical -- just watch the daily show and see for yourself . the bottom line is : you ca n't write material as funny as what the bush administration provides us on a daily basis , so why try to compete ? the main problem with wi is that it feels it was put together in a hurry . to get it done , cusack basically cannibalized grosse pointe blank ( one of his best films ) , changed the setting and crammed in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of naomi klein . most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to halliburton , the neo-cons and the us occupation of iraq , are imaginative , clever or funny . the writers are so blinded by their own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive . the trouble is ... it is n't . by now these ideas are yesterday 's news and unless you 've been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance , denial and sheer stupidity ( read : a right-wing christian ) , these jokes insultingly simple . perhaps wi would work if it was more nuanced , subversive , offensive and fattened up with detailed research/insights into the occupation . as it is , the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad , with so little finesse , subtlety or satirical wickedness , they did little more than make me groan . homer simpson once said `` it 's funny 'cause it 's true '' and the daily show proves this every night ; war , inc. however proves that just because it 's true does n't make it funny . the bottom line : hyperbole is n't required when it comes to lampooning us/neo-conservative politics ... it 's already a big enough joke . http : //eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
