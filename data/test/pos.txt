ok , after reading a couple of reviews on atlantis : the lost empire , i just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from nadia : secret of the blue water . the only part that was a ripoff from nadia is that the pendant from nadia and the pendant from atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it 's used , origins and how it 's created from the source of life that there 's no doubt about it being copied . if you want to consider how kida and nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against disney too ( it was kind of wierd for nadia and kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi , not to mention they both move in a similar style too ) . as an anime fan i have to agree there 's some degree of copying but it 's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original ( like the encryption design on the wall in laputa , the ancient mask from princess mononoke , the resemblence of the vehicles to the garfish submarine in nadia , etc ) ... the plot itself i believe it 's highly original and it 's quite amazing that disney can pull it off without the use of captain nemo ( the main character in jules verne 's 20k leagues under the sea which is also the main character in nadia ) . as for mylo and jean wearing similar style glasses ... as shown in the novel `` lord of the flies '' , glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence . i think mylo , jean , the main character from stargate and a dozen of other `` intelligent '' characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses . as for the submarines , and how the submarines fight ( with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what nautilius does ) , i want to state that it 's a required element for either one if atlantis is involved in the plot ( after all it 's a sunken city beneath the waters ) . as for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from nautilius in nadia , it might be the artwork but i do n't sense any copyright infringement there as the character 's personalities were perfectly original to me . as an anime fan that rated nadia as the # 1 best anime i ever watched even now today . i do have my doubts about atlantis when i first saw the preview . but now that i watched the movie , i once again regained my confidence with disney and have high hopes for their future movies after atlantis . overall , the best disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it 's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better . also , it 's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning ( i was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing )
i read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and more.this is the way a proper horror movie should be.i think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic . the spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood.i liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out.it was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated.the special effects were very good.i would love to see more horror movies like this one.this is easily one of my favorite's.a realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie.other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs.i highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches.i will be adding it to my collection.the dvd has some interesting special features .
i 've seen this movie , when i was traveling in brazil . i found it difficult to really understand brazilian culture and society , because it has so many regional and class differences . to see this movie in sao paulo itself was a revelation . it shows something of the everyday life of many brazilians . on the other side , it is sometimes a little bit over-dramatized . and that 's the only negative comment i have on this film . it 's sometimes too much , too much sex , too many murders and too much cynicism for one film . the director could film some things a bit more subtle , it would make the film more effective . despite this i liked the movie and the way the story unravels itself . the characters are complex , and very much like real-life people . not pretty american actors and actresses with a lot of cosmetics , but people who could be ugly and beautiful at the same time . that makes the film realistic , even when the story is not that convincing .
a fierce , shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted british writer hanif kureishi who wrote `` my beautiful laundrette '' , ( this is the best thing he 's done since then ) . it 's about intelligent people whose lives do n't add up to much . they 've squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels . the only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex . he has his own motives but kureishi treats him with a good deal of compassion . this is a film in which people and places feel familiar , where characters exist beyond the confines of the screen . in some respects it 's a bit like `` sunday , bloody sunday '' but it 's an altogether tougher piece of work . the director , roger michell , allows scenes to build instinctively . and it is beautifully acted . as the eponymous mother anne reid betrays her wasted life in every gesture . there is not a false note in her extraordinarily lived-in performance , and that very fine actor daniel craig displays shadings to his character than even kureishi has n't tapped into . if the film strikes a false note it is , perhaps , in the character of the talentless daughter , caught up in a messy affair with the man her mother seduces ( or should that be the other way round ) and even messier life , but she is so well played by cathryn bradshaw she hooks you in nevertheless . the film is also extremely beautiful to look at ( dop alwin kuchler ) and must rank , unhesitatingly , as the best british film of the year .
contrary to popular belief , this title , to me at least , is not so very bad . in fact . i regard it as a favoured film of all time . the welding of stories was n't structured too well when you consider the differences between the series , however despite all this , you can watch it quite happily . for a feature film of its day , the scenes are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently believable . the sound/audio track is a personal favourite of mine . nearly everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices suit the characters much better than their , now badly cast us dub , counterparts . the sync is perfect in every shot . i had a few issues with the casting for the 'alien ' voices ( please forgive the crude naming , it has been a while since i 've seen it ) . otherwise however , the cast seemed perfectly balanced . i feel and believe in the characters of this movie . dubs are often a subject i rarely agree with from so long ago . i loved the osd 's from back then but the castings often let series down . at this point i would like to add that this was one of the first anime i saw in my life . it has historical value to me , but even after seeing the original megazone 23 it remained stronger and more watched in my collection . to my knowledge the title only ever made it to the us in texas . personally i think its a big shame . had the correct audience been subject to it , i think robotech the movie would have been accepted and not tarnished over the years . i am involved with anime each day of my life and everyone i have shown this movie thought it was a nicely put together title . watching the film after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the evident plot holes between shows . however , without seeing the originals , a viewer would n't really notice . since the animation is identical in style , there was no reason to question it back in its day . the uk had very limited access to anime . laser discs were the most productive media . personally i like the way carl had the balls to at least push the genre . i mean harmony was n't going to put up the cash for the series to get publicised . despite the few picky faults people have had with this film , the eighties feel of it keeps me in love . if you watch megazone 23 now , to its original japanese audio , or the new dub , i believe you will be greatly disappointed with the osd . cast your minds back to the original bubblegum crisis dub soundtrack and imagine new eighties audio to e.v.e . saying all this . this film 's popularity nowadays is most likely down to its rarity on the open market . personally , it spawned a collection for me . i 'm now scouring the world for merchandise from the three components that made it up and if i ever get to meet carl macek , ill shake his hand for the effort , and buy him a pint or a crate for getting me into anime .
ingrid bergman is a temporarily impoverished polish countess in 1900s paris who finds herself pursued by france 's most popular general and a glamorous count -- and that 's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate . such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history . there are backroom political machinations by the general 's handlers , a downed balloonist and ecstatic bastille day throngs , but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats . yes , it 's rules of the game redux . before it 's all over even gaston modot , the jealous gamekeeper in rules , puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo , no less ! things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end , resulting in some confusion for this non-french speaker , but what the heck -- elena and her men is another deeply humane renoir masterpiece .
this a superb self-contained work that is unconnected with anything before or after . brat pack crooning and club exclusivity are not my biscuits of choice , but in this law-free world they make an alluring ambiance . the film is packed with our guys , distinctive actors who add distinction to this work with winning performances . the dialogue is a joy . in fact it 's a new vernacular . one of the few films that can be watched repeatedly with deepening appreciation . highpoints include billy idol 's british loutishness , ben london 's vulturine brassware , kyle 's squirmishness , and the survey of ad hoc philosophies .
i saw this movie when i was a child . it blew me away . this was before the days of television , so a movie of this magnitude , could send a young kid into orbit . it so impressed me , that i went to see this movie for twelve consecutive days . the special effects used at this time were far ahead of its ' time . sabu was a real delight , as was rex ingram as the genie . i found myself singing `` i want to be a sailor '' for months after the film left town . i would recommend this movie to any and everyone . i forgot to mention conrad veidt , who was as villainous a character as you 'd ever want to meet . also , june duprez was never lovelier than she was in this picture . the color was outstanding . give this movie an aaa !
this is an excellent film about a traditional working class family in northern england . filmed on location in bolton , it stars james mason as the father who is the dominant force within his home . or so it seems . cleverly , the film , based on the play , portrays the complexities of family life . the supporting cast is terrific as well , with many familiar faces lending support .
this movie deserved better it 's great fun , has some wonderful jokes and sight gags , some in-stuff for the `` geeks '' amongst us ( and we know who we are ) , and the effects are indeed effectual . watching paul reubens fart in the face of an academy award winner is worth the price of admission alone . i never read the comics series before i saw the movie , but have since . as good as they are , i still recommend mm the film . ( although having the flaming carrot as a character would have been cool , too ) greg kinnear is , well , ... amazing as captain amazing , and no one else could be the shoveller except william h. macy my favorite line in the film ? `` we 've got a blind date with destiny . and it looks like she 's ordered the lobster . '' see this film . buy this film ! it 's only 5 bucks and some change at your local wal-mart . you 'll thank me . really you will . oh , and ms. garafolo is in it . that alone makes it watch-worthy
this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it 's impact on australian society . it especially looks at the problem of innuendo , gossip and expectation when dealing with real-life dramas . one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations . not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis . just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so . this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings . it 's an issue that has to be constantly addressed . the leads play the characters with depth , personality and sensitivity . and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based-on-fact individuals . some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors . it re-enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals . ( spoiler warning ! ) i have to say something very personal here ; in that i am actually an ex-adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred ; so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most . i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality , and emotional heart . i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers . it captured the themes of the story brilliantly . i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to `` play the best case for their character they could '' . while this is especially apt for this story , i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well .
before seeing this , i was merely expecting another mediocre soft core copy of the much imitated `` emmanuelle '' series starring sylvia kristel . it was really surprising how good this one turned out to be . it actually has a story , and it is very romantic indeed . what makes 'yellow emanuelle ' so good is it 's leading heroine , the beautiful and exotic chai lee . she plays her character , emy wong so sweetly , that the viewer just has to feel something for her when her dreams crash down around her . emy wong is a much-respected doctor , statuesque , with a regal quality . she comes from an important old family , where ancient customs are still practiced . emy will remain a virgin until she is married , to a man she has never met . the beautiful doctor seems ok with this arranged marriage . it is simply how it is done in her world . however she does not plan on meeting and falling in love with the british pilot who ends up under her care in the hospital where she works . emy decides to do away with custom , and she gives herself to her western man . but only after a very long courtship , as doctor wong is anything but an easy woman . her pilot , george , is a good guy , and promises to marry emy , so that she does n't lose her respectability and place in her rigid society . neither one counts on a third party , one ilona staller , who destroys their relationship through a series of vicious games . emy is made to believe that she has been abandoned by her man , that he only played a game with her in order to sleep with her . her place in society is gone , she has been debased . the film takes a surprisingly dramatic and depressing turn as this proud , elegant woman gives up her career , as well as a sweet relationship with her caring father , and succumbs to a life of drinking and prostitution . i was surprised to find myself so engrossed in this operatically tragic tale . i was on the edge of my seat when george blows back into town , and unknowingly walks into a hotel where his beautiful emy is working as a prostitute ! classic drama . i imagine many viewers were a bit frustrated by all this drama . one would expect lots of sex and nudity here , but there is not much . and when there is , it is totally non-exploitative , and very artsy and soft-core . if you are a fan of the first emmanuelle , with sylvia kristel , than you most likely will appreciate this , lesser known classic . i was especially impressed by the extra attention to details . the whole segment where emy takes george to her fathers house on the island is really nice . her father shows george , and the viewer his impressive collection of bonzai trees . he has a whole miniature forest built out of these amazing trees . totally unexpected . after catching it on late night cable tv years ago , i spent much time searching the internet for a copy of the film . when i finally got it i found that the video version was longer . more sex ? no , more melodrama . for the dvd release there is a subplot about george suddenly keeling over with some unknown deadly disease ! i actually preferred the cable version better . i am glad that this rare gem has been released finally on dvd . i must also mention the beautiful cinematography and the bizarre and catchy 70 's soundtrack . while watching this one you just get the feeling that you are watching something very rare , and quite special . i recommend it to thoughtful viewers who do n't need sex and violence to maintain their interest .
in what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time , four city guys confront nature 's wrath , in a story of survival . the setting is backwoods georgia , with its forests , mountains , and wild rivers . the director , john boorman , chose to use local people , not actors , to portray secondary characters . these locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history . no central casting `` actors '' could ever come close to these people 's remarkable faces , voices , or actions . i do n't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful . as much as anything else , it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing . another strength is the film 's theme . nature , in the wild , can be violent . how appropriate that the setting should be the american south . very few places in the u.s. are , or have been , as violent as redneck country . in a story about darwinian survival of the fittest , the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature , not separate from it . `` deliverance '' is very much a product of its time when , unlike today , americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness . the film 's magnificent scenery , the sounds of birds , frogs , crickets , and the roar of the river rapids , combined with the absence of civilization , all convey an environmental message . and that is another strength of the film . at an entertainment level , the tension gradually escalates , as the plot proceeds . not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme , and then never lets up , not until the final credits roll . very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot . finally , the film 's technical quality is topnotch . direction and editing are flawless . cinematography is excellent . dialogue is interesting . and the acting is terrific . burt reynolds has never been better . ned beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job . and jon voight should have been nominated for an oscar . if there is a weak link in the film , it is the music , which strikes me as timid . overall , `` deliverance '' almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure . even for those who do n't , the gritty characterizations , the acting , and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film , one of the finest in cinema history .
i just came back from a pre-release viewing of this excellent sci-fi film noire . it 's style is definitively unique and very well made . it is filmed with actual actors , but transformed into a black and white comic-strip style you have never seen before . it goes one step further than sin city , and it does it well . it 's a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures . the story and mood remind of blade runner , and if you liked that one you will surely like this one , too . the storyline is intelligent , never boring and has some nice little twists . this film is a must-see for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely do n't like sci-fi or b & w .
have no illusions , this is a morality story . granger is the troubled ex-buffalo hunter , tempted back to the plains one more time by kill-crazed taylor . granger can see the end is near , and feels deeply for the cost of the hunt-on the herds , the indians and the land itself . taylor , on the other hand admittedly equates killing buffalo , or indians to 'being with a woman . ' while granger 's role of the tortured hunter is superb , it 's taylor who steals the show , as the demented , immoral 'everyman ' out for the fast buck and the goodtimes . there 's not a lot of bang-bang here , but the story moves along quickly , and we are treated to a fine character performance by nolan . the theme of this story is just as poignant today , as in the 1800s-man 's relationship to the land and what 's on it , and racism . considering when this was made , the censors must have been wringing their hankies during the scenes in the 'bawdy house ' , taylor 's relationship with the squaw , and much of the dialogue . although downbeat , this is truly a great western picture .
i thought hugh o'conor was astounding as the young christy brown , and really deserved greater recognition for his role . i could n't believe how well he played the part . of course , daniel day-lewis was brilliant too . my favourite scene is where the boys are playing football and christy uses his head to stop the goals and then kicks the penalty ! amazing performances by the two christys ( and other also ) .
not wishing to give * anything * away here , i would just say this technically excellent , flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half 's entertainment : it will amuse , surprise , possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time , as it approaches the inevitable , but not obvious , ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way . most definitely recommended . a previous user 's comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both branagh and bonham-carter 's outstanding performances - i agree entirely ....
once in a while , a film comes along that raises the bar for every other film in its genre . a film of this caliber will influence many films following its release for years to come . ` a chinese ghost story ' falls in this category . it is arguably one of the best horror films made during the 1980 's ; possibly one of the best ever made . the filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan . the story is engrossing and original . the villains are appropriately menacing and frightening . the sets are creepy and atmospheric . there is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the splatter fan of the house . but do n't let the ` horror ' label scare you off , if you 're not a fan of the genre . this film easily fits into many different categories . the screenwriter has deftly blended the drama , comedy , horror , kung fu , and romance genres into a delicious deluxe cinematic pizza . ` a chinese ghost story ' is a beautiful epic love story told , thankfully , without the gratuitous nudity and/or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many hollywood ` love stories ' . those put off by the romantic elements of the story can sit back and revel in the fast-paced swordplay and ` wire-fu ' . if that 's not enough , actors leslie cheung and wu ma provide enough humorous situations to satiate your appetite for comedy . this film offers something for every film fan . director siu-tung ching and producer tsui hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this film . leslie cheung proves that he is not only a gifted actor , but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian . i can not possibly think of a performer other than cheung who could have portrayed ling choi sin better ( except maybe chow yun fat ) . joey wang is enchanting as lit su seen , the enslaved spirit who steals the heart of cheung 's character . her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable . wu ma is hilarious as the cantankerous taoist who aids the young lovers . on technical level , this film is very impressive , even by today 's standards . the direction is superb . i wish that today 's hollywood executives would seek out talented artists like siu-tung ching rather falling back on the usual mtv video or pepsi commercial ` directors ' . the cinematography is gorgeous . you have to commend any cinematographer who can make a film look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place in the dead of night . the special effects make-up is top-notch . in fact , most of the creature effects in this film blow away the shoddy cgi ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films . since its release , `` a chinese ghost story '' has spawned two worthy sequels , a full-length animated movie , and countless imitations . none of the films that followed it or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic , however . this film is required viewing for any horror fan or just anyone looking for great way to spend 95 minutes of your time . 10 out 10 .
i 'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars . but they just do n't understand the movie . the story is about growing up in a difficult situation . there is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren . and there 's good reason why so many critics like this movie . and the reason is because they understand the movie . i feel sorry for the low scores given by some people . i wish i could just write a brief summary of a movie but imdb requires you to write 10 lines . i frankly do n't have anything else to say .
in iran , women are not permitted to attend men 's sporting events , apparently to `` protect '' them from all the cursing and foul language they might hear emanating from the male fans ( so since men ca n't restrain or behave themselves , women are forced to suffer . go figure. ) . `` offside '' tells the tale of a half dozen or so young women who , dressed like men , attempt to sneak into the high-stakes match between iran and bahrain that , in 2005 , qualified iran to go to the world cup ( the movie was actually filmed in large part during that game ) . `` offside '' is a slice-of-life comedy that will remind you of all those great humanistic films ( `` the shop on main street , '' `` loves of a blonde , '' `` closely watched trains '' etc . ) that flowed out of communist czechoslovakia as part of the `` prague miracle '' in the mid 1960 's . as with many of those works , `` offside '' is more concerned with observing life than with devising any kind of elaborately contrived fictional narrative . indeed , it is the simplicity of the setup and the naturalism of the style that make the movie so effective . once their ruse is discovered , the girls are corralled into a small pen right outside the stadium where they can hear the raucous cheering emanating from the game inside . stuck where they are , all they can do is plead with the security guards to let them go in , guards who are basically bumbling , good-natured lads who are compelled to do their duty as a part of their compulsory military service . even most of the men going into the stadium do n't seem particularly perturbed at the thought of these women being allowed in . still the prohibition persists . yet , how can one not be impressed by the very real courage and spunk displayed by these women as they go up against a system that continues to enforce such a ridiculously regressive and archaic restriction ? and , yet , the purpose of these women is not to rally behind a cause or to make a `` point . '' they are simply obsessed fans with a burning desire to watch a soccer game and , like all the men in the country , cheer on their team . it 's hard to tell just how much of the dialogue is scripted and how much of it is extemporaneous , but , in either case , the actors , with their marvelously expressive faces , do a magnificent job making each moment seem utterly real and convincing . mohammad kheir-abadi and shayesteh irani are notable standouts in a uniformly excellent cast . the structure of the film is also very loose and freeform , as writer/director jafar panahi and co-writer shadmehr rastin focus for a few brief moments on one or two of the characters , then move smoothly and effortlessly onto others . with this documentary-type approach , we come to feel as if we are witnessing an actual event unfolding in `` real time . '' very often , it 's quite easy for us to forget we 're actually watching a movie . it was a very smart move on the part of the filmmakers to include so much good-natured humor in the film ( it 's what the czech filmmakers did as well ) , the better to point up the utter absurdity of the situation and broaden the appeal of the film for audiences both domestic and foreign . `` offside '' is obviously a cry for justice , but it is one that is made all the more effective by its refusal to make of its story a heavy-breathing tragedy . instead , it realizes that nothing breaks down social barriers quite as efficiently as humor and an appeal to the audience 's common humanity . and is n't that what true art is supposed to be all about ? in its own quiet , understated way , `` offside '' is one of the great , under-appreciated gems of 2007 .
`` the kennel murder case '' starts off at a run and does n't stop until the very end . everybody had reason to kill the victim , and several people tried . william powell is terrific as philo vance , gentleman detective . mary astor is refreshing as the put-upon niece who only wants to marry her scottish gentleman and enjoy her inheritance . this movie comes paired with `` nancy drew , reporter '' on dvd , which is also fun . if you have to rent the disc ( or check it out from your local library ) , do it . it 's pure entertainment !
a french film ester williams would love . but the synchronized swimming was only a hook for the story of three girls in a paris exurbia finding themselves . no question where sciamma 's sympathies lie as all the boys are depicted as `` animaux '' but actually only the 3 girls are in focus , and for the entire time , with the few adults and the other adolescents being mostly in the background . marie is a stick of a girl , unattractive , but determined . she wants to be a swimmer and forces herself on floriane ( a renascence quality beauty per one reviewer ) and she is also a friend of convenience to anna : not unattractive , but for her , the time of her body 's perfection was short , and now she is an adolescent in a women 's body . what ensues is a journey to self-realization without a road map but there is a glumness about the three that is un-natural : where is the gaiety and mindless chatter of youth ? while the dénouement was breath taking , with floriane 's self-absorption beautifully portrayed , as well as the equally beautiful union of marie and anne , it all seemed abstract , sciamma 's puppets .
this could be well have been the definitive film noir of all time , had not the columbia studios cut so much of orson welles 's original . what we are left with is a flawed , yet brilliant film that showcases the overwhelming talent of welles as an actor/director and rita hayworth as a serious dramatic talent . 'the lady from shanghai ' is film noir at it 's most sizzling and confusing . welles , with an uneven accent , portrays michael o'hara , a journeyman irishman , who , after a fateful encounter with the seductive , dangerous elsa bannister ( hayworth , in a great performance ) finds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewman on her and her crippled husband 's ( everett sloane ) yacht . elsa , or 'rosalie ' as michael likes to call her , plays the innocent , helpless doll very well , ensnaring o'hara in her web . as the lovers conduct a not-so-secret affair at sea , arthur bannister 's partner in his law firm , george grisby ( glenn anders ) comes aboard . he is a weird , untrustworthy figure who offers michael a unique proposal : he will get $ 5000 to assist grisby in the faking of grisby 's death , so it looks murder . the plan is for michael to get off a technicality , and run off into the sun with elsa . but things do not go to plan . hayworth delivers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrayal . at times she seems genuinely vulnerable and child-like , at others brutal , world-weary and hard . always she is brilliantly beautiful , whether he situation calls for her to be dripping wet in a swimsuit or dressed in black , brandishing a gun . hayworth is beautifully photographed here , and she is a far-cry from her famous 'gilda ' role . her then-husband orson welles cut off her trademark auburn locks for a dyed blonde crop ( angering columbia boss harry cohn ) . it was a terrific marketing ploy , and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully . she is not the sympathetic femme fatale that 'gilda ' is , here- instead she is a predatory , black-hearted dame who sees murder as a very useful option . the welles and hayworth pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in their marriage . they would divorce after the film was made , so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship . they are hateful , not romantic , lovers in this , so it 's hard to gauge whether or not they had real chemistry on screen . certainly every encounter is potent and filled with raw sexuality , with welles as the 'fall guy ' ( he even admits it himself in the film ! ) and rita as the double-crossing babe . welles character is the typical noir 'drifter ' with not much sense . as welles voice-over proves to use , o'hara indeed does not use his brain very much 'expect to be thinking of her ( elsa ) ' . welles usually played intelligent , charismatic fellows , so his turn here as the dim-witted michael is unusual and very interesting . indeed , welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it well . everett sloane is suitably slimy as hayworth 's crippled husband . one wonders why he hires michael . it is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically , so why does he invite a 'threat ' on board ? one interpretation could be that michael provides the 'service ' to his wife that bannister can not in his crippled state . there is definitely something to that theory , with a lot of implications toward elsa 's behaviour before she met her husband ( was she some sort of prostitute ? ) and grisby 's knowledge of bannister 's most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenes . this is a jumbled , convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed . we are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot , as with most noirs . welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches , including the justifiably famous 'hall of mirrors ' climax . it 's a terrific scene , one ending that can almost obliterate the faults earlier on in the movie and lift it into greatness . this fun house scene is visually stunning , with a dali-like feel to the painted sets ( apparently orson painted them himself ) . subtle visual imagery utilized throughout the film by welles enhances the plot and makes this a thought-provoking experience . the dialogue is scorching and confusing , delivered superbly by rita 's alternately breathy low voice and helpless , high-pitched little-girl voice . hayworth proves her acting capabilities in this one , and proves that she is the ultimate femme fatale of 'noir ' . it 's a pity ( only a slight one , as rita was a brilliant dancer ) that she did so many delightful yet frothy and often forgettable musicals for columbia in the 40 's instead of darkly-themed noir like this . she was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent . 9/10 .
uggh ! i really was n't that impressed by this film , though i must admit that it is technically well made . it does get a 7 for very high production values , but as for entertainment values , it is rather poor . in fact , i consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s . it won the oscar for best picture , but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing . that 's because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting ( such as meet me in st. louis ) , this movie is almost all singing and dancing . in fact , this film has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you are n't into this , the film will quickly bore you . give me more story ! as a result , with overblown production numbers and a weak story , this film is like a steady diet of meringue -- it just does n't satisfy in the long run . to think ... this is the film that beat out `` a streetcar named desire '' and `` a place in the sun '' for best picture ! and , to make matters worse , `` the african queen '' and `` ace in the hole '' were n't even nominated in this category ! even more amazing to me is that `` ace in the hole '' lost for best writing , screenplay to this film -- even though `` an american in paris '' had hardly any story to speak of and was mostly driven by dance and song .
while browsing the internet for previous sale prices , i ran across these comments . why are they all so serious ? it 's just a movie and it 's not pornographic . i acquired this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been totally delighted with it . i 've shown it to many of my friends & they all loved it too . i feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent film of shirley before she became popular or well known . after reading the other comments , i agree that the film is `` racy '' . big deal ! i only wish it was longer . it seems that i must be the only person who owns one of these originals , for sale at least , so i wonder how much it 's worth ?
so , fox pulled the plug midway through a drama/mystery ... how lame is that ? do they expect us to invest our time in their new shows when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what happens ? why were n't the remaining , already filmed episodes aired in the us ? they were broadcast elsewhere . hey , fox ! are you listening ? this was a great show , but you left us hanging . if you 're going to introduce new drama/mysteries , at least air a conclusion before abruptly ending mid-theme . every time something like this happens ( and it seems to happen a lot with you - i.e. , fox ) , there are more of those who will `` wait and see '' before investing their time . this means you will see an artificially low interest share , and are more likely to end the series . see ? it is a vicious cycle . do n't let us down again ...
this low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places -- writing and acting . in addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far . in low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but , surprising , it rivals film stock for brightness , clarity , and , saturation in brightly lit situations . this is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a `` midnight cowboy '' kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban san francisco .
no rubbish - no where even near rubbish . not an original ? thats the last thing that could be said of `` 2.4 children '' .predictable ? certainly not ! although it was somewhat an unusual series for the bbc , it was hilarious , funny , and witty . i particularly liked belinda lang and john pickard - who i believe preformed wonderfully.gary olsen was also very good and so were all the other cast members .. i never quite new why it was can-celled till reading here today about gary olsen 's death at a relatively young age . i do wish that they would make more of comedy of this type , much more of them ( and show them here in israel ) .thumbs way up !
sudden impact is the 4th of the dirty harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they do n't really degrade in quality from one film to the next . thus , sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan . this time harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation . harry 's always on the job it seems . clint eastwood plays harry as he plays all his men of action , slow , deliberate , and without fear . as the first of the dirty harry films to be made in the 80 's , sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70 's feel that characterizes the first three films . this does n't mean that it 's quality is any less . bottom line : brimming with intensity and action , sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series .
i first saw a track from this dvd at a hifi show nov 2006 in london ( i was not really into cream until now ! ! ) .it was through a high end arcam system , it sounded great with dts.i had to get this dvd and i 'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music dvd i have ever watched.the performance of cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music dvd.it does not matter what type of music you like , this one will definitely grow on you.it 's the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and again.even new musicians do n't cut the mustard these days , as these old rockers do .
i did n't know the real events when i sat down to watch this , just the fact that this was based upon a true story . after the death of the kid 's father , rhonda tries to help her daughter desiree ( ... i did not know anyone actually named their offspring that ) cope with the loss . this is really made for children , as is often the case with `` family '' flicks ( with that said , go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing , though i 'd keep teenagers out of it , unless you 're sure they 're gon na buy the concept ) , but it does n't downplay the sting that the death of a parent is , and it does n't really talk down to anyone . the plot is sufficiently interesting , and moves along well enough . acting varies , with the excellent burstyn outshining most of her fellow cast , mathis following that pretty well , and ferland and her peers ( with a few exceptions ) being the least convincing of the bunch ( and frankly , they 're irritating ; then again , i 'm not really in the intended audience for this thing ) . the editing and cinematography are standard , and certainly not less than that . while humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so , the tone is not an unpleasant one . there is an intense scene or two in this . i recommend this to fans of these types of movies . 7/10
the title of this film nearly put me off watching it . not being a manchester united fan , the mere mention of beckham was a bit off putting , however i put my prejudices behind me and i 'm glad i did . i was n't expecting much of a film , but i was pleasantly surprised . the film sped along with me never looking at my watch and i enjoyed every second of the film . if you liked east is east then you 'll love this film . ok so the storyline is nothing new , and the classic storylines are contained within the film but it 's all done very funnily , and with a breath of fresh air . the film moves very fast and keeps the audiance entertained . the occaisional funny moments are a good chuckle and not some poor attempt at humour , and best of all it 's a good british comedy .
i have to be 100 % honest with you fellow imdb users . i wanted to see this movie for a very long time only because of the poster . does n't charlotte gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and charming smiling that way ? i 'm in love with that woman ! i got what i expected ... but only half . this film should deliver expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories involving intelligent humor and light dramatic situations . while i do n't agree with another fellow imdb user who states that the movie is overrated ; i must admit that `` préte-moi ta main '' has plenty of flaws . my main problem with the film is the lack of on screen chemistry between the main characters . there is n't a single scene previous to the climax that shows the main characters sharing a moment `` of romance '' or even a clue to suggest that they 're interested in each other . in fact , the only scene were both share a moment is tremendously awkward ( when both are in the couch ) and does not help the audience understand about a possible love interest . i did n't buy the dinner sequence . still , the movie delivers very funny moments and has a strong dialogs that support such an ingenuous premise . i mean with ingenuous that it would be very difficult to execute such a farse by a 43 year old man in these days . i understand it 's a movie and that 's why i accept it as a funny situation . plus , the humor is versatile . there are moments involving s & m , funny lines with chabat 's best friend , some lesbian references , funny situations involving the family women , and more . charlotte gaionsbourg 's performance is top notch and she 's by far the reason to watch the movie . she 's funny , sexy , looks very thin and fine , and demonstrates she 's a versatile and talented actress who can pull out a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance . alain chabat is a fine actor and gives a very decent performance . i think the supporting cast do what they can . the score , art direction , and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look to the film . those who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the ending credits . it 's a good example of feel good cinema .
walter pidgeon is braley mason , a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in `` the unknown man , '' a 1951 film also starring ann harding , barry sullivan , keefe braselle , and richard anderson . a great believer in justice , pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man , rudi walchek ( braselle ) accused of murder and gets him acquitted . shortly afterward , he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood . he is advised by the da ( sullivan ) that rudi is small change , that to wipe out the organized crime , one has to find the top man . mason finds the top man , and is faced with a dilemma . `` the unknown man '' is a small , black and white film that manages to hold the viewer 's interest with its various plot twists , though the plot is somewhat contrived . it 's really the story of a good man seeking his god , justice , and what he is willing to do in order to attain it . and that 's the most contrived part of all . i suppose there was a time before o.j. , the menendez brothers , etc. , etc. , when people believed in justice and the integrity of attorneys . for this viewer anyway , those days are long over . walter pidgeon does an excellent job -- his handsome , elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful , confident man but also a deeply caring one . pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years but never really rose to superstardom . he was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did . it may be because by the time he was getting leads , he was well into his thirties and missed being a matinée idol ; or it could be he lacked that certain something ; or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like greer garson . hard to say . he gives an honest and touching performance here . very good movie with good performances .
based on an actual mining disaster , this early german talkie ( with english subtitles ) still remains one of the most effective docu-dramas ever filmed . featuring many non-professional actors , `` kameradschaft '' gives a chilling view of the friendship that binds the mine workers , regardless of which side of the french/german border they may be from . a deadly accident brings out the very best in everyone , nullifying any superiors ' orders . a fellow miner in need will receive the help of his comrades , even at threat of great loss , including life . this film reminds of the self-sacrificing heroism shown by the nyfd following the 9/11 attacks . putting aside any formal rules and regulations , these men and women in uniform knew only one cause : to save lives , and to find their fellow-fire fighters . -- more than 70 years later , `` kameradschaft '' still has the strong and timeless message : a friend in need is a friend in deed .
clint tollinger arrives in a small town looking for his estranged wife and news of his daughter , tho he finds her , the chance of any sort of reconciliation is very slim . whilst here , the sheriff and the important townsfolk learn of tollinger 's reputation as a pistol specialist town tamer . as they are living in fear of a mysterious landowner who is stripping the town from them bit by bit , they hold a meeting that chooses to hire tollinger to rid the town of it 's unsavoury elements . man with the gun seems to be either a forgotten piece or a vastly under seen one , at the time of me writing this , it has just over 200 votes and a paltry 9 user comments written for it . it 's a shame on either score because although the production values scream out that this is a b movie western , this is a fine entry in the western genre . that the piece takes on a rather standard plot theme of an harangued town turning to an avenging dark angel , probably has n't done the film any favours over the years , i myself read the synopsis and thought it 's just another in the line of similarly themed pictures . yet i was pleasantly surprised to find a darkly dramatic picture boasting many enjoyable moments , both technically and as a functioning story . robert mitchum is in the lead as tollinger , perfectly cast , he strides thru the picture like some brooding menace . we often talk about the screen presence that john wayne and charlton heston had { justifiably of course } , mitchum is right up there with the best of them . one sequence here sees him standing in the shadows at the back of a room as a meeting takes place , we do n't see his face , but we can feel that piercing brood staring out at us ! . the rest of the cast are also very much in mitchum 's shadow , so really it 's solely with the big man that the films acting credentials are high , perhaps it 's unfair to single out ted de corsia for a kick , but man with the gun 's minor failings are with its villains , and sadly de corsia is lacking any sort of villainesque menace . the score from alex north is excellently layered { fans of spartacus will certainly be pricking their ears up } and the cinematography from lee garmes is highly impressive when one realises that the majority of this picture was shot on the studio lot . directed and co-written by first time director richard wilson , man with the gun holds few surprises for the genre , but it 's dark in tone , violent and above all else , highly watchable . 7.5/10
kusturika made it again . another masterpiece . a coral comedy full of his own landmarks , with a frenetic rhythm and many glorious moments , we laughed and laughed , what a party ! the music is everywhere , and also the shooting , the animals , the crazy bastards , sex and amazing gadgets and inventions , everything colorfully visual to entertain only . pure cinema in essence . a wonderful experience to watch . and one is specially grateful since good comedies are so rare , and so wonderful . well , this is one , and if you enjoyed kusturica 's previous films , you 'll love this , although , as in all comedies , it is about a chemical reaction , and you have to be in the mood for it .
this movie re-wrote film history in every way . no one cares what anyone thinks about this movie , because it transcends criticism . every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it . it is an extremely beautiful movie , and i doubt many of us will see anything like it again . i 've seen it more times than i care to count , and i still become transfixed every time , with a feeling which is hard to describe . one for the ages .
this movie is a half-documentary ... and it is pretty interesting .... this is a good movie ... based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in rukjan , norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to germany . this movie is n't perfect and it could have been a bit better ... the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves ! ! ! if you 're interested in history of wwii and film this is a movie that 's worth a look ! !
he is the quintessential narcissist and manipulator ; in this case , portraying attorney ( and murderer ) tom capano . kathryn morris is sympathetic as victim , anne marie fahey , but in the beginning is a bit too much the victim . we are sorry for the situation , but become simultaneously disgusted after seeing his victimization of several other women ( including rachel ward ) as well . the sad part is where she is actually getting help with her self-esteem issues , and capano actually had her psychologist killed . pretty hard to believe , but this was based on a true story . there is a cameo with olympia dukakis ( excellent ) as capano 's mother . all in all , an interesting story because it is based on a true murder , and you will want to read ann rule 's book to get the accurate details . 8/10 .
one of the most appealing elements of a gilliam film is that the well-concocted visuals , the unsettling backdrops , and the manically frustrated characters are evidence of the creator 's involvement . instead of most movies ( where the filmmaker is some director-for-hire that is paid to feature a star or two ) , you can feel terry gilliam 's presence through the experience . `` 12 monkeys '' is evidence of gilliam 's own vision and style , as opposed to making offbeat movies for their own sake . `` 12 monkeys '' is a variation on similar themes of gilliam 's repertoire : oppressive/recessive societies , the solitude of the protagonist , the frustration associated with disbelief , and parallel realms . in this film gilliam does a fine job of blurring lines between the two realms , using ambiguities to force the audience to believe rather than know . this tendency for gilliam to neglect to fill in certain gaps leads to criticisms of art-house pretentiousness . the difference between gilliam and artsy posers is that gilliam 's choices clearly have a purpose and all of his images have meaning . the two nearly identical bathing scenes of cole in the beginning are meant to draw comparisons which leave the audience unsettled . his bald head is a mark of uniformity in the disease-ridden future world , yet makes him recognizable in the 1996 world . the title itself is a mark of gilliam 's creativity , as it requires the majority of the story to flesh out for its meaning to be fully understood . all in all , gilliam 's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch yet also require thought and interpretation from the audience . the film has immense re-watch value , since there are subtle details and hints that can be missed upon the first viewing . definitely one of my favorites .
a team of archaeologists uncover a real treasure  the crown of the queen of sheeba . from egypt , the crown is to be transferred via steamship to san francisco . but it wo n't be an easy journey . there are plenty of would-be thieves who would love to get their hands on the priceless jewels contained in the crown . fortunately for all involved , mr. moto is on hand to guard the crown on its journey . however , that does n't mean someone wo n't try to get their hands on the treasure . after the disappointment of mr. moto 's gamble , i went into mr. moto takes a vacation hoping for the best , but , admittedly , fearing the worst . but within the first 10 seconds of the film , i knew i would find it more enjoyable . i 'm a sucker for a 1930s style mystery that features anything to do with archaeological digs in egypt . and seeing moto disguised as a german archaeologist ( imagine that , peter lorre playing a german ? ) , the beginning scenes really drew me in . while the movie may have quickly shifted to the less exotic san francisco , it remained just as enjoyable . dark , sinister characters lurking in the rainy night ; gunshots fired from open windows that narrowly miss the hero 's head ; sophisticated and supposed foolproof alarm systems just begging for someone to test them ; and master criminals believed to be dead  these are the kind of elements found in a lot of the really good 1930s mysteries that i love . and mr. moto takes a vacation 's got 'em all . a couple other bonuses for me included the always enjoyable lionel atwill in a nice little role , comic relief from g.p . huntley that 's actually funny , and a return to form for mr. moto . i 've already mentioned his disguise in the movie 's opening scenes , well the athletic moto comes out near the film 's finale . moto is a like a whirling dervish of activity as he goes after his prey . all this and i have n't even mentioned the wonderful performance turned in by lorre . any way you look at it , mr. moto takes a vacation is a winner . as much as i hate that the mr. moto series had to end after this installment , it 's understandable when you think about it . wwii was just around the corner . and after pearl harbor , a movie with a japanese hero would n't have gone over very well . at least the mr. moto series ended on a very positive note .
what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be . this is the type of film that i 've been looking for ages . particularly important for me was the fantastic-looking chicago , which i still keep thinking about . the back cover does n't do this film justice , it 's superb , and in my top-5 for sure .
* * * spoilers * * * seething with hatred and revenge half breed zach provo , james coburn , had spent the last 11 years on a chain gang planing his escape . what provo want 's more then freedom is to even the score with the man who captured him and in the process , during a wild shootout , killed his navajo wife : the former pima county sheriff sam burgade , charlton heston . making his escape after killing two prison guards provo makes his way towards yuma knowing that that 's not just where burgade lives but where his his young daughter susan , barbara hershey , resides as well . using his fellow escaped convicts to lure burgade into the vast arizona desert , by promising them $ 30,000.00 in gold coins that he buried there , provo plans to exact his bloody vengeance on burgade . but only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow convicts or are , in not being with a woman for years , as horny as a rabbit during mating season ! brutal and very effective western that updates the john wayne 1956 classic `` the searchers '' in a father searching through dangerous indian territory for his kidnapped daughter . charlton heston as the guilt-ridden sam burgade in his felling somehow responsible for killing provo 's wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff . charles coburn as the vengeful half breed zach provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict . the man who escaped with provo are really not interest in his personal affairs but have no choice , in that he knows the territory like the back of his hand , but to go along with him . it 's only the thought of them having their way with susan , when provo gives them the green light , as well as the buried $ 30,000.00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way . also going along with burgade is susan 's boyfriend hal brickman , chris mitchum , who proves in the end that he 's as good as burgade is , who felt that he just did n't have it in him , in both tracking down the escaped criminals as well as using common sense , which in this case burgade lacks , in doing it . * * * spoilers * * * * the unbelievably brutal and blood splattered showdown between burgade and provo is almost too much to sit through . provo who 's hatred of burgade bordered on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death . it was that hatred that bugrade took advantage of and , after taking some half dozen bullets , thus ended up putting the crazed and blood thirsty , as well as mindless , lunatic away for good !
at first i was weirded out that a tv show 's main character could bring the dead back to life , but then i thought i 'd give it a shot . guess what ? i love `` pushing daisies '' and look forward to wednesday nights just to watch it , then for the next week i watch it a few more times on my dvr . the colorful characters , witty banter , fast-paced dialogue , and new unique situations draws me in and captivates from beginning to end . ned and chuck charles ' relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they can not have physical contact . even detective emerson cod 's character has continued to grow in complexity . and olive snook ! jiminy crispies ! she cracks me up ! the narrator 's voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that i am watching a movie instead of a tv show . i have recommended my family and friends to turn on `` pushing daisies '' and they are hooked too ! ! ! the show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen `` p.d . `` , i highly recommend watching it !
hamlet is by far my favorite of all of shakespeare 's works . branaugh is one heck of an actor . his portrayal of this was just amazing . his soliloquies were breathtaking . for as long as it was it is rare for a film to hold my interest , however i was engrossed in this particular piece . i recommend this to anyone both fan of shakespeare and those not so much . this has everything the modern world looks for in its films : murder , betrayal , and deceit . not to knock mel gibson 's version , but branaughs touches the whole work . this leaves no stone unturned . when you finish the film it will feel as if you read the play yourself . um how you say `` two thumbs up '' .
`` that '70s show '' is definitely the funniest show currently on tv . i started watching it about two and a half years ago , and as soon as i saw it i could tell it was a great show . i like all the characters , but my personal favorites are fez and kelso . leo was also an awesome character while he was there , i really hope he comes back because he 's hilarious . it 's classic when fez goes `` you son of a bitch ! `` , and when kelso yells `` burn ! `` , that always makes me laugh . they are both great characters and always have something funny to say . jackie being hot is just another reason to watch the show ; she started out being really good looking but damn , somewhere around season 5-6 she just got really hot . i 've seen most of the episodes more than once , some like 10 times , and there still hilarious . this is one of the few shows that i can watch over and over and still laugh at just as much as i did the first time i saw it . the cast is classic ; almost everyone is funny , where with many shows there are only a few funny characters . i will be sad to see this show end next year , but it will be going off the air as one of the best shows ever .
kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals . a journey on the darkest road ever . the road of no return . the plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in california . the man ( david duchovny in his best role up to now ) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in america and his girl - who is a photographer - is going to take the pictures . so they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way . to share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad . but the couple that answers it is not just any couple . it is one of the strangest couples ever . the girl is a naive , frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses . the man is exactly the opposite . a cruel ruthless murderer . we learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to kalifornia ( not with c as usual , but with k , presumably symbolizing the word killer ) , along his journey of betrayal , murder and finally defeat . all the leads , duchovny , pitt , lewis and forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star . the photography is amazing , with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie , and the music suits the dark character of the film . on the whole this is a really good movie . do n't miss it . you 'll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with !
i had the privilege of watching scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release . it was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project can not be emphasized enough . scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring al pacino as cuban drug lord tony montana . in this version , tony comes to america during the cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s , early 1980s . tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in tent city and after a brief stay at a cuban restaurant ; tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction . many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch i have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years . robert loggia as tony 's patron , frank lopez is wonderful . his character is flawed by being too trusting , and as tony quickly figures out , soft . lopez 's right hand , omar suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors , f. murray abraham ( amadeus . ) suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for frank ; it is like he does not have a mind of his own . tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with suarez , but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top . the character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is mel bernstein , the audaciously corrupt miami narcotics detective played by harris yulin ( training day . ) mel , without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry . he plays tony off of frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both frank and mel . it is priceless to hear frank asking for mel to intercede , as tony is about to kill him only to hear mel reply , ` it 's your tree frank , you 're sitting in it . ' this is from the man who frank had been paying for protection ! tony 's rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn . after offing frank and taking his wife and business tony 's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough . as tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs , greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married . this all sets up the ending in which tony 's compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered . this all stems form a compassionate moment when tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim 's wife and children . all in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture . depalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around . the violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind , particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen , the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie . this is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish , or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels ; depalma let it all fly right here .
this movie is a little unusual in that it 's got a very slim plot and the movie itself is done at a very slow and leisurely pace . while this makes it pretty different from the average grant film , it is still highly watchable and entertaining . it 's sort of like someone said `` let 's just follow cary around and watch as he gets perturbed at all the little problems that come up when you are having a house rehabbed '' . considering what a fun actor he is in the film and the great support he gets from myrna loy and melvin douglas , the film works very well . while the film has pretty modest pretensions , it makes the most of the material . it 's a great film for cary grant fans or for the whole family .
i too have gone thru very painful personal loss ( twice ) and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well , life out of balance , nothing makes sense , well meaning relatives , etc ... it was nice to see ally again . she is one of my all time favorite movie actors . i laughed and cried as the story unfolded . great story and cast . well done !
okay , this film is about bedknobs and broomsticks , it 's one of the most charming , delightful movies you 'll ever see as a kid . it 's the unforgettable movie about two adults and two spunky kids on an adventure for fun . it may be a little deniable to watch , but try it , i neither my mother did n't think it was bad , i was very enthused with the movie and the animation , they were all quite good . it is a delightfully wondrous comedy for the whole family to enjoy ; even the kids . ages 7 years and up will enjoy this wonderful , musical comedy with you and your family especially the animation . the animation movements and layouts are really nice and deserve a thumbs up . it 's a terrifically good musical for the whole family so what are you waiting for ? go to the video store and rent bedknobs and broomsticks now .
a wonderful movie ! anyone growing up in an italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters . a good family movie with sadness , humor , and very good acting from all . you will enjoy this movie ! ! we need more like it .
while returning from a christmas eve shopping trip , an abused suburban housewife ( basinger ) finds herself in a fight for survival after a disagreement with a group of delinquent youths takes a violent turn . suffering the indignity of a straight to dvd release here in the u.k. , susan montford 's directorial debut will perhaps not be given the recognition it deserves . this is a shame , as the standard of the writing , directing and acting is very good indeed , and certainly surpasses the quality of your average straight to dvd flick . kim basinger gives her best performance in some time as the downtrodden wife of an abusive husband ( craig sheffer ) . while sheffer is not really given anything more to do than be a threatening presence , it is in their brief scenes together that basinger connects - showing painful vulnerability yet hinting at the rage that will eventually boil over in her confrontations with the youths . it 's a truly great , understated performance , her transformation from victim to aggressor is seamlessly played . lukas haas i initially thought was miscast , as he ( along with the other three youths ) just did not seem much of a threat . however , had all four youths been more physically imposing , the later scenes in which basinger turns the tables against them would not have worked at all . the fact that these are four average men , albeit slightly unhinged , is the key to why the film works as well as it does . apart from a few pacing issues during the latter half of the movie and a couple of cheesy lines here and there , what we have here is a great thriller that actually leaves the viewer with something to think about when the film is over . some may be put off by the slow - burn nature of the opening scenes , or the abrupt ending . others by the at times brutal violence . i say give it a chance , it 's certainly more deserving of your time than saw v .
other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film . that 's simply not true and a little unfair . the acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluidity . i do n't think there 's anything wrong with the tarantino-esquire way of interlocking stories together . perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try . i thought it made the film much more interesting . perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening , but that 's about the only fault i can find . nestor cantillana gives a great performance as sylvio , also antonella rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone .
i have seen `` miracles still happen '' now at least four times . i never tire of this fantastic movie . from the very beginning , it holds a person 's interest . as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon , following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor . losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the perils this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon . to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could actualy survive this is unspeakable as we see the wild animals , snakes and other reptiles , the enormous forests and wildlife as well as countless insects . as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town . remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community , this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie . at times having to swim in dangerous waters , alone , frightened , injured , she always managed to keep going . towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her perils . eventually as she sees a canoe , she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her , after fearing she was dead along with the many other passengers . such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her father 's face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon ! movies like this are n't made much those days . i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it ! to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just unspeakable ! also the fact she only maintained a few very slight injuries was even more remarkable , whereas everyone else on this airplane perished in the horrific crash into the wilds of the amazon . a brilliant movie , superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching ! strongly recommended by me for sure !
if you are uninitiated to the gundam world , this is a good place to start . if you are burned out on star wars or star trek , here is a compelling , realistic sci-fi series you can become immersed in . not the simplistic boy-saves-world-in-giant robot story you might have expected , but rather a complex , emotionally compelling space war drama where the line between the `` good '' and `` bad '' guys is decidedly less than distinct . gundam 0080 focuses on the story of al izuruha , a young , naive boy living in a neutral space colony . he spends his days daydreaming about mobile suits and playing war with his friends . during the course of this series , al befriends an `` enemy '' soldier , bernie wiseman . by the end , little al learns some hard lessons about the reality of war and the requisite suffering and sacrifice . i loved this oav series , with its cool mecha designs , involving story , and likeable characters . i recommend this series to anyone who likes realistic sf anime , or to those who think anime is just silly or sexy entertainment .
my boyfriend and i both enjoyed this film very much . the viewer is swept away from modern life into old japan , while at the same time exposed to very current themes . the characters are realistic and detailed ; it has an unpredictable ending and story , which is very refreshing . the story is made up of mini-plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district . i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old japan .
yes , i loved this movie when i was a kid . when i was growing up i saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another vhs copy because the old copy had worn out . my family received a vhs copy of this movie when we purchased a new vhs system . at first , my mom was n't sure that this was an appropriate movie for a 10 year old but because we had just bought a new vhs system she let me watch it . like i said , this movie is every little boys dream the movie contains a terrific setting , big muscled barbarians , beautiful topless women , big bad monsters and jokes you 'll only get when you get older . so , a couple of days ago i inserted the video and watched the movie again after a long time . at first , i was bored , then started thinking about how much i loved this movie when i was kid , and continued watching . yeah , the experience was n't as great as i remembered the acting is pretty bad , the storyline is pretty bad , the jokes were n't funny anymore , but the women were still pretty . yes , i 've grown up . even though the movie experience has changed for me , i still think it 's worth 7 stars . for the good old times you know
this is a reunion , a team , and a great episode of justice . from hesitation to resolution , clark has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny , to a superman who , like green arrow , sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones , ready to save the whole planet . this is not just a thrilling story about teamwork , loyalty , and friendship ; this is also about deciding what 's more important in life , a lesson for clark . i do not want the series to end , but i hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what justice shows without any `` rewind '' pushes and put a good end here of smallville -- -and a wonderful beginning of superman . in this episode , however , we should have seen more contrast between lex and the team . nine stars should give it enough credit .
when sabrina first came onto our screens i was about 12 , and therefore spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch get into all kinds of weird predicaments . it was always one of my favourite programmes , the witchy feeling of sixties sitcom 'bewitched ' but this time the character was cooler . i always liked sabrina because she was smart . she was also friendly and easy going which made her enjoyable to watch . the characters at the beginning were great ; harvey , jenny , libby , the quizmaster , salem and mr. poole ( my personal fave , shame he left so early on ) hilda and zelda her aunts started off ok , but then became irritating . i liked mr. kraft too as he was always that little bit closer to discovering sabrina 's secret . what i loved about the first three series was the original ideas , the discovering of the family secret and learning new spells but as it went on it became more predictable . too many characters came and left , such as valerie , dreama and brad and then they decided to do sabrina at college which ruined it for me . sabrina became self-absorbed at college , there was less magic , no spell book , no aunts living with her and roxie , miles and morgan were annoying . the last series was boring , and i only watched to see what happened in the end . not having hilda and zelda seemed wrong somehow and miles was gone just like that . the last episode made me feel a lot better though ( spoiler ) having sabrina end up with harvey on her wedding day to dullard aaron was great ! overall a great programme if you forget the poor last two or three series which reminded me of so many teen shows . magical .
this was a delightful presentation . hemo ( blood ) as a greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity , arrogance , snobbish superiority and innocent wonder . the quote ( or scene ) i recall vividly is when hemo tires of `` all this plumbing ... you have n't learned my secrets at all '' and threatens to storm out , the scientist answers him in a single word `` thalassa '' -- salt water which horrifies the fiction writer but mollifies hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood . such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released . stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning .
this movie is one for the ages . first , i have to say after seeing this once , it became one of my all-time favorite movies . why ? simple ; ben coccio ( writer , director ) has put together a true piece of art . where 99.9 % of movies these days are purely entertainment , director ben coccio gives us truth , gives us reality , gives us a learning tool to know why this happened . the mainstream media spins and spins but ben coccio looks school shootings right in the face , able to go where no other form of media has ever gone before , into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates . while it surely is graphic and horrifying , how could n't it be ? the gloves come off , the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened . sometimes it is n't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think , no , sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper , are more human , we are shown that these boys are us and we them . society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real . respect and love your fellow man . a lesson we all should learn , thank you so much for making this film mr. coccio , i hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film-making career .
the williams family live on a ranch located in the middle of the remote desert . they find themselves in considerable peril when the place is suddenly thrust into a time vortex where the past , present and future collide in a wildly chaotic and unpredictable manner . director john `` bud '' cardos begins the film on a compellingly mysterious note and gradually allows things to get stranger , crazier and more exciting as the loopy story unfolds . moreover , cardos fills the screen with plenty of dazzling visuals and does a nice job of creating a genuine sense of awe and wonder . the admirably sincere acting from a game cast qualifies as another major plus : jim davis as hearty patriarch grant williams , dorothy malone as his cheery wife ana , christopher mitchum as the concerned richard , marcy lafferty as his lovely wife beth , natasha ryan as sweet little girl jenny , and scott c. kolden as the gutsy steve . the funky special effects offer an inspired combo of gnarly miniatures , neat stop-motion animation monsters ( said creatures include a tiny spindly hairless guy , a big , lumpy , fanged beast , and a scrawny lizard dude ) , and nifty matte paintings . richard band 's rousing full-bore orchestral score really hits the stirring spot . john arthur morrill 's crisp , sunny cinematography likewise does the trick . a fun flick .
i 'm not a steve carell fan however i like this movie about dan , an advice columnist , who goes to his parents house for a stay with his kids and ends up falling in love with his brother 's girlfriend . its a story thats been told before , but not like this . there are simply too many little bits that make the film better than it should be . the cast is wonderful , and even if carell is not my cup of tea , he is quite good as the widower who 's suppose to know everything but finds that knowing is different than feeling and that sometimes life surprises you . at times witty and wise in the way that an annoying hallmark card can be , the film still some how manages to grow on you and be something more than a run of the mill film . worth a look see
when i first heard about this series on animetv , i have to say that out of all the shows that i have seen , this one tops it all off . i had to see this show , and that is what i really did . when i got the first volume of this show , it was the best . i really liked the animation , and all the fight scenes were awesome . i have to say that my favorite characters in the show were saber , and archer and of course i also like illya . and of course , all the episodes on the volumes were interesting , and very cool . another thing i have to say about the series is michael mcconnohie ( famous for transformers , and others ) playing the voice of berserker . he does have a cool character . and i even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume . so if you to see something good , then see this show , it 's the best .
one of the most heart-warming foreign films i 've ever seen . the young girl is an amazing talent . stellar performances by her ( doggie ) , the old man ( the king of masks ) , and liang ( the living boddhisatva ) . ( spoiler ) the deplorable treatment of children , especially females is disturbing . loved the music . the original chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story . this is a must see -- enjoyable family film , although not for very young children . would have rated the dvd release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the dvd and the transfer had included the widescreen version .
faithful to the work of pearl s. buck whose years spent in china as a child of missionary parents that provided her with deep insights into the chinese culture and its philosophy , this film adaptation is brilliantly done , both in technically artistry and acting . wang lung is a humble farmer grateful for the basics of life : to survive off of his land and to be newly wed to olan , a servant to a rich and powerful family in the village area . despite wang lung and olan 's best efforts to farm the land , raise kids , and build savings and wealth , a famine threatens to wipe out everything they have worked for . choosing not to sell their land , a traditional asian belief , they instead journey to a major city to wait out the famine . while in the city , they are reduced to begging and being just one of hundreds of other unfortunate homeless families . although not a looter , olan gets caught up in a mob looting at a rich man 's house . she 's summarily rounded up for execution by the army , but is saved at the last minute . her good fortune , however , is that she found valuable jewels at the looting site that affords her and her family the opportunity to return to their farm to start over again . the newly found wealth transforms wang lung . he becomes selfish , self-centered and takes credit for the find . he becomes a very rich farmer but that only makes matters worse as he increasingly becomes more unappreciative , arrogant and difficult to reason with . he loses touch with the basic things in life that money ca n't buy : loyalty , commitment , trust , fairness and honesty . as punishment , nature once again turns the table on wang lung by sending a plague of locust to destroy everything he has . brought to his knees , wang lung enlists the aid of all friends , former friends , workers , and family . with all that help , he succeeds in saving the farm . from that experience , he once again returns to humbleness and an appreciation for the basics in life .
i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves , then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie . now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering . her eyes are the mirror to his soul -- and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are . those who take things literally will find marleen gorris ' poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating . romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded .
i 've been trying to find out about this series for ages ! thank you , imdb ! i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind . as a 6-year old , of course , i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops , which was absolutely chilling ( i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine , which i still have ) what i also remember , though , was the atmosphere , which was unusual right from the beginning - mysterious , austere , and extremely authentic . when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation . it 's a very hard thing to capture - and probably impossible in hollywood . every 'odyssey ' i 've seen since has been an enormous let-down . the characters in this series seemed genuine , real people - ancient greek people - and not some hollywood stars in costumes . this is a real masterpiece ! but - why is it not better known ? and why is n't it available on vhs or dvd ? i would just love to have the chance to see this again !
i did n't really know what to expect when going out to watch the film , apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a russian bride over the internet . that and it had nicole kidman in it . i absolutely loved the film though , and came out thinking 'wow ' . refreshingly down to earth , the film moves along nicely , with a few suprises at each corner . the relationships in the film are believeable , with nicole and chaplin working against each other beautifully . the humour is subtle , with some great 'office'-like scenes at the bank , and the thriller element add tension without being hollywood . overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation . it 's less about heroics and more about delicate relationships . brit-filmmaking at its best ... ( 9/10 )
having seen the peter o'toole version recently , i was ready to be awed by the smart writing in this version . little time is spent on the fighting , which i prefer . instead , we are shown all the many motives underlying both the french and english ( who held normandy ) politicos and priests who put her to death . even the worst hypocrite of them all , the archbishop , leaves us with the thought that `` of course , she was innocent . the innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the mighty . she had no idea what she was saying , no idea of the implications of blasphemy or going against the church . unschooled , she had no idea of what the church 's stand on such matters even was . '' preminger was true to the myths surrounding her death , and i appreciated the preview on the tape that showed the flames reaching up and burning her . why ? they used gas jets in the movie , and 2 of them were stopped up . suddenly , the air pressure blew out the stoppage and the flames leaped up right on her . thankfully for her , they did n't have to repeat the shot as it was so realistic : she was being burned ! ! pretty traumatic introduction for an iowa girl to her new career of acting . john gielgud performed outstandingly . he is the english politico who is orchestrating the show . he also makes the point that once you condemn someone to death , you do n't want to be around to watch them die . you might shrink from your 'duty ' the next time ... not that such delicacies bother the soul of our would-be president . we christians , even the most anti-semitic have no problem with falling back on the old testament when it comes to capital punishment , even though it was overridden by jesus ' words . bring on public executions like this little girl 's . smelling burnt flesh might bring us respectable folks to our souls ' senses . the only little 'pick ' i have about this film is that we are not shown why the priest who has been so adamantly urging her burning becomes so suddenly so contrite , even to the point of madness . there should have been more expansion of his character , more dialogue -- as the sudden 'coming to his senses ' does n't make sense . and , whether graham greene does this deliberately or not , st. joan is such a self-assured little upstart , you almost but not quite , are glad she meets her come-uppance . and , when she turned down life in prison , for some reason i thought of anne sexton , the poet who accused sylvia plath of 'stealing her death ' when she committed suicide ... knowing such an action guarantees immortality . you got ta wonder ! ! if ever there was a good example of obsessive thought and logic-tight compartments , this is one . st. joan should have turned buddhist and quieted the 'voices in her mind ' .
excellent endearing film with peter falk and paul reiser joining forces as father and dad . dad shows up one evening to state that after over 40 years of marriage , mom ( olympia dukakis ) has left him . the rest of the film depicts the father and son on a day trip to get dad 's thoughts off what has occurred . with them away , the daughters can play detectives . the story shows the adventures of father and son in their discussion of life , what should have been , why mom was complaining about dad as they discuss their philosophies of life . we see an unexpected fishing trip and pool playing which leads to a near brawl . both men seem to break out of their daily lives . the end is a downer as we learn why mom suddenly left . it becomes a story of courage and the human spirit in the face of adversity . it 's never too late to change .
i have screened this movie several times here at college , and every time i show it , the number of people watching with me grows exponentially ... in addition to the virgins , anyone i 've already shown it to needs to see it again ! it takes a little while to get into it , but by the end the whole room is screaming , shouting , yelling , rewinding scenes repeatedly , repeating dialogue , and just totally and completely engrossed in the moviegoing experience that is pia zadora in `` the lonely lady '' ! scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed , poorly written , horribly acted trash is thrown at you in an all-out assault that ranks as the campiest thing i own ( no small statement , friends ) . for me nothing compares 2 u , pia ... and i do n't suppose i 'm the only one who 's ever felt this way !
every kid has that movie that he pops into vhs when he has nothing to do , or when there is a babysitter around . this was that movie for me . i can tell you the whole plot exactly , i must have seen it 100 times at least , and i can say it is a good kids/family movie . i still have the tape , i have n't watched it in 5 years , but maybe i 'll get around to it this week , and be a kid for the day . you just have to love the care bears , and their messege .
eleven different film makers from different parts of the world are assembled in this film to present their views and ideas about the wtc attack . this is one of the best effort you will see in any film . films like this are rarely made and appreciated . this film tries to touch every possible core of wtc . here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film so unique . there is the story from samira makhmalbaf ( iran ) where somewhere in iran people are preparing for the attacks from america . there a teacher is trying to educate her students by informing them about innocent people being killed in wtc massacre . then comes a story from youssef chahine ( egypt ) where a film maker comes across face-to-face conversation with a dead soldier in the wtc attack and a dead hard core terrorist who was involved in wtc attack . then we see a story from idrissa ouedraogo ( burkina faso ) where a group of five innocent children 's sees osama bin laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from america . then we see the story from alejandro gozalez inarritu ( mexico ) where you see a black screen and slowly you see the real footage of wtc buildings coming down . and the people who are stuck in the building are jumping out of it to save their lives . the other most important story is from mira nair ( india ) where a mother is struggling to get respect for her dead son whose name is falsely trapped in wtc massacre ! after september 11 attack , our heart beat automatically starts pumping if we hear two names anywhere in the world .. first is world trade centre and the second is osama ! this film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more to it . i will definitely recommend this movie to everyone who loves to have such kinds of home dvd collection . definitely worth every penny you spend . but please do n't expect anything more apart from films in this dvd . there is of course filmographies of the film makers but no extra features .
a clever , undeniably entertaining romp starring peter ustinov as a career embezzler with his sights set on a us conglomerate in london . he 's abetted by foxy ( and deceptively sharp ) maggie smith and threatened with exposure by jealous company man bob newhart . this is a heist film with a lot of brains . ustinov is exceptional as is smith and newhart is quite funny . the real surprise is karl malden , as the pill popping `` executive vice-president . '' malden has seldom been so loose . cesar romero and robert morley pop up in some funny cameos . the excellent music score is by laurie johnson . eric till 's direction is brisk and the script by ustinov and ira wallach is first-rate & very smart . a swinging good time !
i can only echo the praise of the other reviews here . it 's a delightful film with a feelgood factor that it achieves without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality . naturally sweet - no added sugar . one small point : it seems to me that the mild objections raised about ustinov 's character pendelton being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that pendelton is clearly a genius/savant at this sort of thing . yes , the film was pretty computer illiterate , but it did show pendelton 'studying computers ' at his flat , and i believe the implication was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject , practically overnight . there were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that gnatpole was trying to test pendelton 's knowledge and call his bluff . i 'm not sure whether we were supposed to believe that pendelton cunningly weaselled his way out of these situations , or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough to pass the tests - it was a little unclear . certainly he had to know enough to set up the dummy accounts . presumably wallach and ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked in those days , and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at , it 's necessary to know quite what their concept was . they knew there was something about 'procedures ' which was important ; they thought that the 'smart light ' could actually control security , rather than just indicate its state ; they thought that the ( dumb ) user terminal 's features would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself - though apart from things like graphics feature i do n't see it meself . mostly , i think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could , and they did that rather well . allowing them a bit of artistic license , i do n't think their efforts had any flaws worthy of note . cd
the violent and rebel twenty-five years old sailor antwone fisher ( derek luke ) is sent to three sessions for evaluation with the navy psychiatrist dr. jerome davenport ( denzel washington ) , after another outburst and aggression against a superior ranked navy man . reluctant in the beginning of the treatment , he gets confidence in dr. davenport and discloses his childhood , revealing painful traumas generated in his foster house . meanwhile , he meets cheryl smolley ( joy briant ) , and they fall in love for each other . resolving his personal problems , antwone becomes a new man . this true familial drama is a touching and positive story of a man who finds a friend and is sent back to a regular life . the direction of denzel washington is excellent , making sensitive , attractive and with good taste , a story about child abuse . in the hands of another director , it might be a very heavy story . my vote is eight . title ( brazil ) : 'voltando a viver ' ( 'returning to live ' )
it is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary . at times there is almost a desperation , as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound , surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside ( as did happen to some ) , rin-tin-tin . however , was pertfectly natural . in such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences , some were sure to stand out john barrymore 's soliloquy from richard ii is a moment certainly worth preserving . by and large , only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence . however , this is over all reasonably entertaining , and a must for `` film buffs '' especially interested in the silent to sound transition
i picked this up in the 'danger after dark ' box set , and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt . i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore-fest and with very bad dialogue . which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america . instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters , and the way that sho ( gackt ) develops through the movie as a person . the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good , considering they are n't professional actors , and the director did a marvelous job with it all , setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards . on a side note , taro yamamoto 's performance was very surprising . the only other film i 've seen him in is battle royale , where he plays shogo kawada , and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of shogo . toshi is bright , exuberant and hyper , serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics . shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it . so , watch out for his performance , if you 're familiar with battle royale , you 'll be very surprised by him . but do n't be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box , because this is n't really a vampire movie . it 's just a movie with a vampire in it . that hyde 's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what 's really going on in the foreground , and you guys will love the last scene . it 's a really moving picture at some points , the photography is really well done . it 's definitely something to pick up the next time you 're at blockbuster .
this movie is pretty cheesy , but i do give it credit for at least trying to provide some characterization for it 's principles . there are some great moments in the film and the dialogue has some great moments as well . the aerial assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie . i guess i really like the idea of what lengths a veteran will go for a fellow veteran . sure it 's not all that well done , but the premise is not at all bad . tom
i know the film snobs are snorting . but if you 're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the b-movie jungle , try `` jake speed '' . a little thin at times , but its one-liners and the location more then make up for this . john hurt ( god love him ) , seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra evil white slaver . the nemesis of crawfords , jake speed . he adds a dimension to the film that only a pro like hurt could provide . crawford and dennis christopher ( jakes sidekick ) are a good team , although you do wonder why they both put up with each other.however , together both crawford and christopher portray a team that is just so much fun that , if you can get over yourself for a moment , you may find yourself acting like a kid again at the situations and the inherent suspense they provide.the delicious karen kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress that is more concerned about the motives of her rescuer then her tormentor . i have yet to find a movie that is as much fun without getting preachy , or bogging down the movie by trying too hard . not every movie has to be the latest `` citizen kane '' . and trust me , wells was an original . so lets remember that sometimes , movies are for fun.not social commentary or attempting to sway an audience politically . but just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a time when our hero 's live in a celluloid dimension .
this was stupid funny movie .. cheech and chong are the dopiest wasted guys ever ... i rate this film a 7 .. but if you like this one then go see jay and silentbob ! there funnier and crazier . now cheech is a sellout working on kids movies ..... wheres chong ?

an excellent film with great performances from zack & lochley . much to their displeasure ( & mine ) garibaldi arrived on station . ( all due respect to jerry doyle but in seasons 4 & 5 i lost sympathy for the character . ) it does n't take him long to start criticizing zack ( who i love best of all on the show ) and taking charge . i 'm sure zack could have coped . the soulhunter plot is fascinating , especially if you believe in heaven as zack does . the humour supplements it nicely . 10/10
first , let me say that notorious is an absolutely charming film , very lovingly rendered of its time and subject ( s ) . gretchen mol is utterly , painfully convincing , the very soul of the contradictions smoothly reified by ms . page herself . irving and paula klaw are richly drawn as the working-class stiffs they were ( having met paula at movie star news in 1990 i can say that lili taylor 's performance is unimpeachable ) , and jared harris as john willie ( coutts ) is an adoringly debauched genius . anyone with an interest in the recorded history of american attitudes toward sexuality must see this movie , in a theater preferably , where votes made with dollars count more . second , i will allow that i am a producer of material similar to that for which the klaws would become famous , which is no way affects my estimation of ms. harron 's work as the splendid piece that it is , but does condition my view of notorious as an act of political resistance of the first order . ms. harron has crafted a work of subtle subversion . along with v for vendetta , it is a movie about another time for our times . few readers of this site will be aware that the government they will see enacted in notorious ( through transcription of the very words uttered in closed senate committee hearings ) is a very close approximation of the one they live under right now . while ms. harron expressly disallows that she has a political agenda appended to this film , her faithfulness to the facts , and the respectful and unsensational way in which she renders them , synchronizes notorious with the present day . the very acts that notorious portrays in loving and accurate detail are defined as obscene by the communications decency act , recently brought to the supreme court as a first amendment case and turned back there at the behest of the bush administration . in other words , the delicate and ineffectual bondage depicted in notorious is indictable today by federal prosecutors in whatever ( hostile ) jurisdiction they choose . of course , there were no hearings in the senate or elsewhere on this matter when the cda was passed . of course you know nothing about it , because you do n't want people in peoria telling you what you can and can not look at ( likewise , people in peoria probably do n't want me telling them what they 're allowed to view ) . of course notorious will never be indicted . it 's hollywood . it 's lawyered up . countless klaws will , however , continue to be steamrolled by a puritanical bureaucracy that has not advanced its aesthetic , moral or biological composition much in 50+ years . in addition , notorious posts no 18 usc 2257 compliance statement , which is mandated by the unnoticed `` earmark '' recently voted into law . if any media contains images of `` sadomasochistic restraint '' it is required to make available ( ex warrant ) records of age and circumstance of all performers . notorious fails in this regard also . in addition to being a splendid piece of entertainment and an ( nearly ) accurate historical document , notorious will be the litmus against which the bush justice department is itself judged with respect to the 14th ( equal protection ) amendment and on perhaps several other constitutional grounds . in this regard alone , a debt of gratitude is owed mary harron . you 'll be grateful in any case , constitutional or otherwise , if you see this film .
carlos saura 's carmen is one of the finest achievements in world , let alone spanish , cinema . it manages to excite interest in flamenco in its wonderful staged adaptations from bizet with powerful physical force . at the same time we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of carmen on the choreographer/director and the principle dancers . the fine line between life and art is dazzling .
this is one of quite a few cartoons with bugs bunny and marvin the martian - and a space dog called k-9 is included as well . this looney tunes episode is very funny , has reasonably good cartoon animation ( marvin 's animation is very well done ) and the plot is well done . the end is rather weird , so be prepared for it , it is slightly boring . in this episode , marvin the martian has been sent to earth to capture an earth creature and bring it back to mars . with his trusty dog k-9 , marvin sets out and soon finds the tracks of no other rabbit but bugs bunny ! he greets them with treats , thinking they are trick or treaters in their costumes . little does he realise they are preparing themselves to take this rabbit to mars ... i recommend this episode to anyone who likes bugs bunny , marvin the martian and looney tunes in general . as far as the beginning and the middle of the episode are concerned , you are likely to like this . enjoy `` hasty hare '' ! : - )
according to the book the last of the cowboy heroes which is about joel mccrea , audie murphy , and randolph scott , the author says that albuquerque was the only film he personally did not review because he claimed it was lost . had n't been seen in years . good thing for western fans somebody was doing some spring cleaning at paramount because a print was apparently found and now it 's out on the open market . albuquerque is a pretty good western too with scott involved in a family feud with uncle george cleveland . george cleveland sends for his nephew randolph scott with the intention of making him part of his freighting business , headquartered in the fast growing settlement of albuquerque . cleveland is more than just a business owner , he 's the town boss which he runs from a wheelchair . he even has the sheriff in his pocket . randolph scott is not a cowboy hero for nothing . that includes not backing relatives up when they 're villains . he goes to work for a rival outfit headed by brother and sister russell hayden and catherine craig . cleveland is full of all kinds of tricks and he even sends for a western mata hari in the person of barbara britton to worm her way into the confidence of his rivals . barbara 's great as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda . randolph scott 's original home studio was paramount , it was where his first studio contract was with . albuquerque marked the last film he ever did for paramount and they gave him a good one . note also lon chaney , jr. , who is george cleveland 's chief henchman , a rather loathsome bully of a man and gabby hayes , who is just gabby hayes . albuquerque must have been loved by republicans across the nation in 1948 with its chief villain as a town boss who rules from a wheelchair . a certain democrat from a wheelchair had made hash of them for four straight presidential elections and he was gone . they had high hopes of winning the white house that year too , but things went awry and they had to settle for an ersatz boss getting his comeuppance in albuquerque . i 'm not sure why cleveland was in a wheelchair since nothing was really made of it in the plot . my guess is he was injured and played the part that way because he had to . still albuquerque must have had great appeal to the gop market .
the man in the moon is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950 's . the main story follows a 14-year old girl ( reese witherspoon ) who develops a crush on a 17-year old neighbor ( jason london ) who ends up falling for her older sister ( emily warfield ) and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family 's dynamics forever . the 1950 's are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately . witherspoon already begins to show the oscar-winning talent she would develop in this early role and london makes a charming leading man . warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well . kudos to sam waterston and tess harper who play the girls ' parents and gail strickland , who plays london 's mom . i was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase `` family ties . ''

i ca n't stand it when people go see a movie when they know they wo n't like it . my mom likes violent movies , so why did she see it ? she rated it just to bring down the rating . so i know that 's why it did n't have a higher rating . i give it a 6/10
when i went to watch this movie my expectations were really low , but i was pleasantly surprised . i thought i was going to watch a boring teen-flick , but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed , the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from melville who really shows his talent in this movie , and the fight scenes were - for a low budget movie - very well done . i think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received . it is a movie , which can be seen by the whole family - maybe not the smallest of kids , since it contains some rather rough scenes . a movie about love , and the problems that can occur , when you go against your family traditions . yes , the movie is very much like `` bend it like beckham '' , but i actually think this movie pulls it off better .
`` the invisible mouse '' is a delightful and different tom & jerry 's cartoon . it features the usual cat/mouse chases and battles , but in a different way this time . jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of `` surprises '' for tom , scare him , torment him and confuse him . as much as it is weird , it 's also very cool and funny to see what we ca n't see : jerry invisible . it 's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who 's doing it ( we know who , right ? ) - it 's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts . it 's equally amusing to see jerry eating some candies and fruits while he 's invisible . i really like that instrumental music which plays when he 's not visible . some of the best jokes on this short are when tom sees jerry 's shadow and slams him and even when tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and jerry writes `` missed me '' . i also like when jerry drinks tom 's chocolate milk , becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face . overall , this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon : humor , entertainment , fun and some nice artwork too .
the author of `` nekromantik '' , jörg buttgereit 's second feature film , `` der todesking '' is a powerful masterpiece . centered around a chain letter originating from a group called `` the brotherhood of the 7th day '' , the movie shows 7 episodes , each consisting of one day during one week , where suicide is approached using different characters and situations all the while the letter is making it 's rounds . do not touch this one if you like hollywood movies or musicals , enjoy happy or even remotely `` normal '' movies or expect a movie to be good only , if it is focused on stage acting . the nihilistic , avant-garde approach of der todesking well explains , why buttgereit 's movies in general were banned in germany , their native country of origin , during the 80 's and most of the 90 's . der todesking is not really focused on the characters appearing on-screen , but the meaningless apathy or depression most people 's lives consist of in general . buttgereit does not find reasons to go on living , only reasons to stop , and in choosing how and when you die , you can also be the king of death , der todesking . buttgereit 's movies are generally difficult to categorize and der todesking is no exception . featuring the same crew and almost the same cast as all other of his movies , `` art film '' would probably be the closest description every time . der todesking features an original method to shoot , create the mood and handle the central object in almost every scene . during one scene , the camera slowly , continuously pans in 360 degree circle , while a person lives in a small one-room apartment for a day . during another , buttgereit uses sound and film corruption to depict the collapsing mental state of a man , while he dwells in his desperation . during a third , seemingly pleasant scene names , ages and occupations of actual people to have committed suicide are shown on-screen , supposedly warranting the ban in germany for this particular movie . episode movies ( and especially this one , as the scenes are only vaguely connected ) generally suffer from incoherence , and der todesking is no exception . while all episodes have the same focus of inflicted death and it 's consequences or subsequences in all it 's variations , there are very powerful episodes , yet an episode or two might even seem like filler material , partly draining the overall power of the movie - still , the the jaw-dropping , immensely powerful intermissions depicting a decomposing body manage to keep the movie together and cleanse it from it 's more vague moments back to the status of greatness . the general atmosphere is baffling , awe-inspiring , highly depressing and sometimes even disgusting - so much so that dozens of people left in the middle of the movie during a theater showing in a film festival i took part of . this is one movie that does leave a lasting impression and i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a special experience and something they will definitely remember in years to come . not recommended for the faint of heart or show time fans , this is a small , different movie that truly raises feelings in the audience . whether it be confusion , amazement or even hate , you are n't likely to be left cold by this , in my opinion the best , achievement of this small indie crew . the main theme of the movie , `` die fahrt ins reich der menschentrümmer part i-iii '' was released in a limited 666-piece 8 '' vinyl edition , which is now much sought after . you still can get the classical masterpiece by getting `` the nekromantik '' soundtrack cd , which i highly recommend . the lo-fi synthesizer music in the movie is dark and quirky , almost illbient-like , makes an essential part of the movie 's atmosphere , and is something you would very , very rarely hear otherwise . much recommended !
the `` men in white '' movie is definitely one of the funniest , if not the funniest , comedy movies i ever watched ! ( and i watched quite a lot ! ) it is about two garbagemen , who become `` men in white '' and then stop an invasion from space . it is also a parody of lots of classic movies , such as `` men in black '' , `` star wars '' or `` dr. strangelove '' . anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head . there are tons of funny gags and jokes here , and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard ( it happened to me ! ) . if you can watch this movie on tv , watch it now - you certainly wo n't regret it !
marvelous james stewart , vera miles vehicle . what makes this historical film dealing with the fbi so good is the family element that is involved during a 35 year career as depicted by stewart in the film . the film shows a history of the great investigatory agency . it deals with airplane bomb plots , killing off of indians in oklahoma for real estate gain , fighting organized crime , nazis and communists in that order . the human element is never far behind as stewart weds vera miles . they raise 3 children as miles ' heart goes out each time stewart goes out on assignment . look for a brief but memorable performance by murray hamilton . years later , he appeared as mr. robinson in 1967 's `` the graduate . '' the film has nothing but praise for j. edgar hoover . he certainly brought the fbi up to par . true , this could be viewed as right-wing propaganda , especially with stewart 's real-life republican views , but it 's well done , historically informative , and the view of the family so well depicted .
no strings attached features carlos mencia doing stand-up that makes us both laugh and think . not only does he poke fun at racial issues ( like many haters claim ) , but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country ... what women mean when they say they want to be treated equally ... why americans are crazier than arab terrorists ... why nobody needs to pray for the pope - and what he hopes he 's doing in heaven ... a theory of how easter ( aka big ups to jesus day ) traditions got started ... his viewing of the movie passion of the christ - and his sub-sequential argument with a woman about whether or not he 's affected by jesus ... how society should treat the physically handicapped ... and even if you have the right to tell a joke or not . also , he never stops reminding us that each of us has a voice . so we should use it to speak the truth , say what we think , and not be afraid if others are offended . carlos is the bomb .
i loved this movie . great storyline and actors and good movie sets . it told the story in a way i can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep . i would like to know where i could get the soundtrack . i can not find it anywhere . please email me if you know where i could get the soundtrack . other than not being able to find the soundtrack i thought the movie was fascinating . swayze did a great job . i think this is some of his best work . his past movies were ok , but this one really told a story for a change . this will go down in history as being one of the best tv films ever aired . congrats to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work .
somewhere near the bottom of the film studio ladder you can find companies like u.f.o , troma and beneath them lie seduction cinema . seduction is a direct to video production company that specialize in lesbian themed , non-hardcore erotic movies . it has developed a very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title as they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star misty mundae . i say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance on the show masters of horrors has caused her to set her sights a little higher than the zero budget s.c efforts which forces the company to find a new identity . but back in their glory days they released this film on a very appreciative world . the gorgeous misty mundae is forced to attend a boarding school at the request of a absent father . at the school she meets her absurdly hot room-mate played by ruby larocca who immediately has designs on her but the headmistress ( barbara joyce ) has other plans . in typical s.c style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances . ms. larocca appears to be having a great time as the sexual predator who views misty as a tasty meal and darian caine makes a welcome ( though brief ) appearance as satan . this is the sort of film that jess franco would crank out in the 70s ( although this one does not have the hardcore sex that franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales ) and fans of that madman 's work would be wise to give this one a go . to me , as a long time zero budget cinema fan ( and troma worshiper ) , i came across the seduction cinema films through their parody films ( playmate of the apes , who wants to be a erotic billionaire ) but i actually prefer their more original works . you either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films . for me the most obvious thing that unites these no-budget movies is a real sense of fun . these low budget companies are able to create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland , by the numbers , studio efforts that load up the multiplexes . if you have never seen a seduction cinema film either this or sin sisters ( featuring both of the mundae sisters ) are excellent choices to begin with . this one is a fun , fast paced film ( although the frequent exterior shots of the school do get a little old ) and the dvd is totally loaded with extras including a ton of previews of other company offerings , a great behind the scenes featurette and some deleted scenes including a alternate opening . i do recommend you pass on the disc 's bonus feature , the first film by director , as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing .
another entertaining travolta dance flick ! great music , mood , and scenes . debra winger is beautiful ! like `` saturday night fever '' , this macho film features extremely improbable scenes of beautiful women falling for travolta and almost begging him to have sex with them .
nyc , 2022 : the greenhouse effect , vanished oceans , grinding unemployment and scarcity of water , power and food .. and new york 's population has topped 40 million . this is a little gem of a picture , not least because a resource-depleted future is a reality for us 21st century citizens . the low-budget opening titles of this movie are great : set to music , a low-tech 'tape-slide ' sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973 , depicts an unspoiled american pastoral developing into a polluted and crowded hell in less than 2 minutes . succinct and unambiguous , it 's truly memorable . budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints , at odds with the story 's brilliant premise . the police station sequences are like an episode of some 70 's tv detective show , and the other interior sets look basic at best . the budget probably all went on trying to 'futurise ' the soylent executive 's 'chelsea west ' apartment with state-of-the art goodies , meaning the other costumes are perfunctory , some establishing shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exteriors seemingly all shot through a smoke filter . the memorable scene where sol and thorn ( charlton heston ) share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society : they enjoy real bourbon , lettuce , celery , tomato , apple , and beef , and we really sense their lip-smacking appreciation of someone else 's wealthy privileges . robinson 's pivotal death scene , in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called 'home ' , depicts him immersed in images of the world 's once-beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them , beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced thorn 's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted , among other horrors . this is one smart film , and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s . yes , i know we 're not eating the dead yet , but with our resource-sapping longevity , spiraling poverty gap , corporate global capitalism and unchecked habitat destruction leading to climate change , the lasting prediction of 'soylent green ' may come to pass .
walt disney & his 9 old men put their own 1950 spin on the classic fairy tale of cinderella , which i guess you could say helps form an unofficial `` fairy tale princess trilogy '' from the classic disney years . the plot : cinderella is a nice girl who ca n't catch a break . she is the daughter of a nice , wealthy widower who loved her dearly , but her mother passed away when cinderella was very young , and cindy 's father felt she needed a mother figure , so he eventually married the woman who would become known as lady tremaine , herself a widow with two daughters about the same age as cinderella , anastasia and drizella . at first they all seemed to get along , but then cinderella 's father died , and lady tremaine 's true nature was revealed - she was a cold , cruel , callous , heartless , mean spirited woman , and she passed those traits on to her daughters , who were spoiled , bratty , and equally mean spirited . anastasia & drizella hate cinderella because they know deep down that she 's better looking and an overall nicer , more attractive lady than themselves ( i.e. , more appealing to men ) , and their mother , lady tremaine , hates cindy for pretty much the same reasons . as the years passed lady tremaine began to squander the family fortunes in a stubborn but futile quest to improve/refine her awkward , unattractive daughters ( to call them `` homely '' would be an insult to homely people everywhere ) while all three relegated cinderella to being the multi-tasking servant of the house , abusing her , mistreating her and humiliating her every chance they get ( they are particularly fond of increasing her already absurd workload ) . that brings us to cinderella in the present , where she has blossomed into a good looking young lady who somehow manages to remain kind hearted and nice despite her abusive step family and holds on to the hope that one day the tables will turn in her favor . cinderella gets her shot at freedom & happiness when a royal ball is held to introduce the local prince to an eligible young maiden so that he can take her as a wife , settle down , start a family , etc . naturally , her step family tries to keep her from attending , even going so far as to physically assault her and rip up the dress she had procured for herself ( with a little help from her mice friends - the dress belonged to her biological mother ) . finally pushed beyond her breaking point , cinderella runs out into the courtyard and cries in despair . it is at that point that her fairy godmother , a short , plump , jolly woman , arrives and provides cinderella with transportation and a transformed dress ( after all , cinderella would n't make a very good impression at the ball if she entered the scene looking like she had just gotten gang raped ) . cindy arrives at the ball , the prince falls hard for her , but that pesky midnight rule gets in the way , forcing her to flee , but leaving behind a glass slipper . make a long story short - after a long harrowing quest to find the mystery girl via trying on the glass slipper , cinderella is found and she and the prince get married , giving her the happy ending she deserves . overall , an enjoyable disney classic . not without its flaws , the most glaring of which is that the prince is little more than a macguffin to help push the plot along - he has very little screen time and even less dialogue , so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with cinderella ( which is unfortunate since , according to the making of documentary , the prince was originally meant to play a bigger role ) , and a few additional scenes to help flesh out cinderella herself might have been helpful ( there was a song that showed her fantasizing of turning into an army of maids to clean up the house as well as eavesdropping on her step-family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy , which was cut because walt himself thought it made her look spiteful ) . still , cinderella herself is a likable enough heroine , even if she is upstaged by her mice friends , and there 's a sweetness to the film that is becoming harder to find these days . of course , if this were being made now , cinderella would probably put up more of a struggle against her family during the dress ripping scene and would probably free herself in the climax ( either by picking the lock herself or making an impractical yet exciting jump down from her window ) but this is beside the point . and for all those who say cinderella sets a bad example for young girls , well , consider this - at least cinderella did n't go around getting publicly drunk and indecently exposed , unlike some modern day `` princesses '' ( you know who i mean ) .
michael stearns plays mike , a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality . he has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that 's when he loses it . he believes that when women actually have sex that 's when they lose any sense of `` innocence '' and/or `` beauty '' . so he strolls through the hollywood hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance , ultimately shooting the men dead with a high-powered rifle with a scope . the seeming primary reason for this movie 's existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again . the `` story '' comes off as more of an afterthought . this is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we 're treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity ( the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes ) and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation . of course , seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism . ( for one thing , mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger . ) this is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack . those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another . it even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds mike and renders him uncertain * how * to react . it unfolds at a very slow pace , but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist . it 's a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen . 7/10
having first achieved fame with drunken master , jackie chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983 's project a , a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re-established him as a major star . by the time police story was released two years later , the extraordinary hype surrounding jackie was reaching its zenith , and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts , brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy . it broke numerous box-office records and inspired a 50 % rise in police recruits , but , viewed 20 years on - is it any good ? as an action movie police story unquestionably stands up . there are several terrific fight scenes , some stuntwork that recalls the very best of chan 's hero buster keaton , and a compelling if over-violent climactic tussle . jackie 's performance is also very strong , and whilst the frequent forays into laboured comedy dull the film 's impact just a little , his charisma carries it through . furthermore , in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose recklessness puts others in danger , jackie took a momentous gamble ... though in the event nobody seems to have noticed ! by praising police story as a simple 'good vs . evil ' battle critics belittled the film 's ambiguity of tone , and whilst it 's hardly the brothers karamazov , in depicting such uncertainty the film nevertheless represented a notable and praiseworthy shift from conventional ideas . in short , this remains a quality `` popcorn '' movie * ( though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or deposited into glass showcases in the film 's final scene ) - a potent , boisterously entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period .
this is why i so love this website ! i saw this film in the 1980 's on british television . over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life . with barely a few key words to remember it by , i traced the film here , and much information , including the fact it 's about to become an off-broadway musical ! interestingly , unlike the previous comment maker , i do not remember finding this film sad , or exploitative . on the contrary , the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength , honour and dignity . ironic you may think , considering the squalor of their lives . maybe it 's because i live in britain , where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money , where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding ; i saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit , deep and profound humour , whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect . in a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a 'cult ' . over the years , as it faded in my mind , it shone the brightest , above all others as a one off brilliant & outstanding televisual experience . it was such a deeply private expose , it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a new york musical . but perhaps somewhere , the daughter will be amused by such an outcome . it is she who will have the last laugh maybe .. ( they made a musical out of her before you jackie o ' )
this movie is not only the funniest film ever created , it 's the greatest . my hats off to mr. and mrs. zodsworth and the rest of the wacky , wacky cast . good morning satan , want a donut ? see it post haste ! go see it now !
1936 was the most prolific year for astaire and rogers . their second film for rko that year is the third film in this collection  mark sandrich 's 'follow the fleet . ' this time out astaire is painfully uncomfortable as bake baker , a seaman on leave who just happens to stumble into the seedy waterfront café where sherry martin ( rogers ) is warbling romantic sweet nothings in everyone 's ear . yep , you guessed it  they 're hot for each other once again . only this time sherry 's spinster sister , connie ( harriet hillard ) threatens the whole fine romance by falling for bake 's robust seafaring buddy , bilge smith ( randolph scott ) ; a sort of use 'em up and toss 'em out kind of guy , thus forcing sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general . irving berlin lends immeasurable class to the proceedings with his classic , classy score , including standards 'let yourself go ' , ' i 'm putting all my eggs in one basket ' and 'let 's face the music and dance ; ' the latter a divinely inspired skit about suicide that turns into another immediately recognizable and thoroughly sublime pas deux for fred and ginger . the transfer on 'follow the fleet ' is a tad weaker . the gray scale remains nicely balanced but now it 's a tad thick looking with not nearly as much tonal variation as the previous titles . grain is still present . so are age related artifacts . once you 've settled into to the slightly dense and sometimes more softly focused image quality , the overall impression is more than acceptable for a film of this vintage . the audio is mono but very nicely balanced . extras include a featurette , theatrical trailer and short subject , but oddly  no audio commentary . considering the importance of this film in the overall canon of astaire/rogers this is an uncharacteristic oversight from warner home video .
spoilers alert homeward bound : the incredible journey is an important film from my life because it 's the first film i remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4-year old scamp . the story is based on the sheila burnford novel , and is a reason why it 's not possible to write this one off as a brainless lassie clone . the basic story : two dogs and a cat happily live in the seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children , gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner san francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months . the bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong , and shadow the golden retriever and sassy the himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are , though the young and happy-go-lucky american bulldog known as chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical ( due in part to his voice-over explaining his being abandoned as a pup , picked up to an animal shelter , and being bought by the family ) , though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling . the three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness ( fantastic wilderness settings by the way ) , driven on by shadow 's instincts of direction . they meet several perils along the way , hoping to make it home , while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance . there are funny moments all the way through , great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines ( see - memorable quotes ) , and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling , punctuated by moments of sadness ( such as when sassy 's arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall , leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers ) . somehow though , i fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take . somehow , it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story . the ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg , finds it hard to get out and gives up , exhausted , followed by chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out , telling him how important he is to him and how he 's pushed them this far so he should n't throw it all away so easily . the way that this scene ( brilliantly done ) is n't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when chance and sassy return home , but shadow is nowhere to be seen . then just as all seems lost , he slowly appears , and is reunited with the family . chance 's conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey , and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there , leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown , but also how the other two have as well . hang on a second , i think i 'm going to cry ... anyway , i have n't read sheila burnford 's book , so i do n't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie . but this is a film that all the family can watch , and while the tots will love the talking animals , older viewers will understand the plot line better ( as i found when i watched the film again after several years without seeing it ) . this film is a masterpiece in cinema , and i suggest that if you have n't seen it you go out and get it ! and please avoid the sequel ( see my review for homeward bound ii ! )
a winters day , 28th december 1986 , two bored 14 year olds hire a movie . `` hmmmm , police story , looks interesting '' , `` who is this jackie chan ? `` , `` never heard of him '' . two hours later after watching the film , in a daze , we wanted to know more . 16 years later ( and severely out of pocket from collecting jc movies ! ) the film still grabs me like no other . ok , maybe i have a soft spot for it as it was my `` first '' ( cannonball run does n't count ! ! ) jc movie , but it is an excellent movie . it has all the classic jc elements , action , humour , action , heart and action ! some comments say it 's dated , it was made in 1985 , of course it 's dated ! but then so must jaws , casablanca , singin ' in the rain and the godfather ! ! ! ! ! ! without movies like police story where would hollywood action be today ? ps set standards , many a scene has been stolen for use in other movies . to really fully appreciate it you must see it in widescreen , you miss so much of the movie otherwise ( yes , he really does fall off the bus going round the corner ! ) . if you have n't already , see this movie now ! ! ! !
as a knowledgeable fan i recommend this film as faithful to the facts and well acted . as an 11 year old living in istanbul i heard some friends talking about a new music sensation that caused girls to scream . i thought hmmmm , if girls like them , they must be crap . my only records until then were haley mills , the everly brothers & ricky nelson . soon after while on vacation with the family at a military cafeteria in ismir i heard a song ( which i later learned was 'love me do ' ) and was floored by the difference between it and every song i had ever heard until then . when i heard the 'meet the beatles ' album of my older brother i was hooked for life . having read the definitive book of their beginnings ( by davis ) i was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well with the exception of leaving out most of the sex and some of the drug use ( it did touch on the use of methadrine/dexadrine ) . >
think pierce brosnan and you think suave , dapper , intelligent james bond . in this movie , brosnan plays against type - and has lots of fun doing so ( as does the audience ) . this is a film about a hired assassin who befriends a harried businessman ... and it works ! this is a fun movie , with very good scenes ( a riveting , on-the-edge brosnan and a good , compliant `` off '' -the-edge kinnear have some good lines ) . my only cavil is that hope davis , playing the oh-so-tolerant wife ( `` can i see your gun ? '' ) does n't appear more often : she could have been a marvellous foil to these men . this movie is like a matador : it plays with the audience , while `` going for a kill '' . the ending is awesome because a storyline ( with a positive moral ! ) emerges : this is a frenetic , frantic and fun movie , which does deserve a wide audience .
the 1930s . classy , elegant adele ( marvelously played with dignified resolve by debbie reynolds ) and batty , frumpy helen ( the magnificent shelley winters going full-tilt wacko with her customary histrionic panache ) are the mothers of two killers . they leave their seamy pasts in the midwest behind and move to hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring kid starlets . adele begins dating dashing millionaire lincoln palmer ( the always fine dennis weaver ) . on the other hand , religious fanatic helen soon sinks into despair and madness . director curtis ( `` night tide , '' `` ruby '' ) harrington , working from a crafty script by henry farrell ( who wrote the book `` whatever happened to baby jane ? '' was based on and co-wrote the screenplay for `` hush ... hush , sweet charlotte '' ) , adeptly concocts a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt , fear , repression and religious fervor running dangerously amok . the super cast have a ball with their colorful roles : michael macliammoir as a pompous elocution teacher , agnes moorehead as a stern fire-and-brimstone radio evangelist , yvette vickers as a snippy , overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star , logan ramsey as a snoopy detective , and timothy carey as a creepy bum . an elaborate talent recital set piece with pamelyn ferdin ( the voice of lucy in the `` peanuts '' tv cartoon specials ) serving as emcee and original `` friday the 13th '' victim robbi morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead-on mae west impression qualifies as a definite highlight . david raskin 's spooky score , a fantastic scene with reynolds performing an incredible tango at a posh restaurant , the flavorsome depression-era period atmosphere , lucien ballard 's handsome cinematography , and especially the startling macabre ending are all likewise on the money excellent and effective . mgm presents this terrific gem on a nifty dvd doublebill with `` whoever slew auntie roo ? ; '' both pictures are presented in crisp widescreen transfers along with their theatrical trailers .
when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky , and i 'll complain about anything and everything that is done wrong . while every movie has its flaws , the night listener had an exceptionally low count . if you read the last review ( it was hard , since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie ) , you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done . unfortunately , if you read more than 3 lines into that same review , you discovered the poster 's reason for disdain : he/she does not like the fact that the director is gay ( or that the production team smokes crack ... apparently ) . so , despite the fact that i have never written a review before , i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits , not the sexual orientation of its director . let 's go over a quick checklist first : 1 . great plot ? absolutely . i wo n't give a shred of it away , but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials . this is a thriller , not a horror , and it should be approached as such . the story really will amaze you , even more so because it 's true ( and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events ) . 2 . wonderful acting ? oh yes . robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type-cast , and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago . he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener , playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of ... well , i 'll let you see for yourself . 3 . excellent direction ? certainly . now , unlike the other poster to which i referred , i actually know something about direction . i 've been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years . of course i really do n't think that makes a lick of difference ( the only thing that matters is if you like the direction ) , but i thought i should simply establish once again that i 'm basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant ... for example : not the sexual orientation of the director ( or the alleged drug habits of the production team , lol ) . patrick stettner 's direction was moody and dark , and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so-sought-after feelings of `` tension and release '' rather than the messy , fast-paced camera-work and quick cuts we 're so often subjected to today . some people can truly show you a story through their camera , while other 's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera . i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized , which is as an eyeball through which we all see . 4 . lighting , cinematography , and editing ? great all around . i 've already wrote so much , and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs , so i 'll just wrap it up . in short , go see this movie . do n't listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it , especially if they 're so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1/4 of the way through their post . enjoy the show ! -ben
something about the 40 year old virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer , wedding crashers , is similar , but they are two different films in some respects . both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top , crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20 's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films . both have some sort of formula to the stories as well . but by the end of the 40 year old virgin , i think i found overall it was more satisfying than 'crashers ' . although one can guess where the relationship story with steve carrell 's character andy and catherine keener 's character trish will go to , it is n't too basic for one to figure out like with crashers , and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic , more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other . and , perhaps , it may also depend on how much you identify ( or just find the lunacy ) in both . the thing is some people may go into the 40 year old virgin not knowing steve carrell as well as owen wilson or vince vaughn , as carrell has built up his cult status on the daily show ( one of my favorite shows on now ) and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in anchorman and bruce almighty . this is his first starring role , but it 's not treated like some third rate vehicle . he and co-writer/director judd apatow treat the character of andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way , even early on as he talks to his action figures while re-painting them . it 's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the lackluster 40 days and 40 nights with josh hartnett ( also about sexual dysfunction ) . as the title suggests , andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little pee-wee herman in him ( the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious , a good sign ) . so , his friends ( among them paul rudd , romany mancoy , seth rogen , all very good comic foils ) try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over andy 's head to pop his cherry , so to speak . he almost gets with a overly drunk woman , he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl , and almost with his own boss ( jane lynch , also very funny in the mockumentaries ) as a ( explitive ) buddy . but this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with trish , who works across the street from him . as they build on a relationship not based at all on sex , one might worry that the plot gear of `` how is he going to tell her such and such '' might get in the way of the comedy . it does n't . in fact , if anything , carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree . for practically an hour and a half of the film 's two hour length , there was barely a moment i was n't laughing , whether big or small . the big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot , or one or two little stray stories ( the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well , rudd 's being the funniest ) . the big laughs come through because of carrell 's reactions , and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm , or that its with some truth . keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship ( and , un-like 'crashers ' , there is n't as much that does n't make sense character wise ) . for someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face , carrell gets very high points here . and like with a farrelly brothers movie , the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity ; the 'waxing ' scene ( which was done for real , by the way ) and the sort of aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film ( the way it comes out at first is a total , uproarious surprise ) . but if you 're willing not to get offended by it , there 's more where that came from . this is one of the funniest films of the year .
shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of , the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect , certainly much more true to the peter o'donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films . you can read the strip currently in the reprints from titan books , or in comics revue monthly . it is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time . the movie is n't great , but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got , and it holds your interest . on the dvd extras , the interview with quentin tarentino , who is obviously stoned , is a gas . some people have faulted tarentino for associating his name with the film , but without him it would never have been made . he is a modesty blaise fan , and picked a good writer and director . all things considered , worth 8 stars .
i disagree with previous comment about this movie . i think it was cute and fun and it carried a good message for young girls like my daughter . you do n't have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool . you can be smart and pretty and classy all at once . i think the cast was good and the story was fine for the target audience . all-in-all my wife , daughter ( 10 ) and i each thought it was a good movie . i certainly recommend it . it also has encouraged my daughter to start reading the original nancy drew mysteries which i am sure she will love much as i loved the hardy boys . it was a struggle to get her to sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away . i ca n't think of a better outcome for that movie than rekindling interest in that classic series .
i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession . i just wanted to check it out . i was not expecting much of anything . after all , a musician , an actor and a screenplay writer ? not possible for so much talent to reside in one person . right ? ? wrong ! ! obsession aside , it quickly became one of my favorites ! the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects . the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along . as the credits roll by , you suddenly realize you were glued until the end . at times , the acting seems a little over the top . i do , however , believe it 's done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character . otherwise , i would n't have expected the level of acting witnessed . it 's worth seeing more than once . i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two around . i completely recommend this movie . feel free to go in with your doubts , but i 'm sure it will find a place on your shelf .
anyone who does n't think bill and ted 's bogus journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked . it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no-brainer , but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time . one of those rare films that actually improves upon it predecessor , bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again . notable highlights include the duel with death and the ending , which is highly `` emotional '' . keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best , ted theodore logan in bill and ted : the return .
for muslim women in western africa , married life at the hands of abusive husbands can be very hard . the community may not explicitly endorse such behaviour , but equally , they may not yet be ready to see it as criminal , an attitude which of course enables it to continue . fortunately , the letter of the cameroonian law promises equality to all , and this documentary follows the real life exploits of various female practitioners in the cameroonian legal system as they attempt to secure justice for a number of women and children . what is notable ( apart from the uplifting central story ) is how , in spite of their informality , the courts are actually pragmatically progressive , if a case is actually bought . the program also gives a fascinating insight the whole cameroonian life-style , which ( aside from the awful crimes committed in the featured cases ) seems amazingly emotional and joyous compared with that enjoyed by inhabitants of europe or north america . and while i concede that this comment may betray naiveté on my part , this attitude appears to be captured in delightful pidgin-english they speak . overall , this is a terrific little film , and much more fun to watch than you might imagine .
citizenx ( 1995 ) is the developing world 's answer to silence of the lambs . where ` silence ' terrorized our peace of mind , ` citizen ' exhausts and saddens us instead . this dramatization of the chikatilo case translates rather well , thanks to a westernized friendship between two rostov cops who become equals . citizenx may also argue against ( ! ) the death penalty far better than kevin spacey 's the life of david gayle ( 2002 ) . humans are machiavellian mammals , under which lie limbic brains ( lizard-logic ) . why did two kids , who knew better , stone to death a toddler they kidnapped ? why do bloodthirsty women yell ` li-lilililililii ' at acts of obscene terrorism ? -my own term for this is ` limbic domination ' , the lizard-logic urge to dominate an ` enemy ' . if you have the words ` enemy'/ ` vengeance ' in your vocabulary , you 're easily capable of ` limbic domination ' . in wwii-devastated 1980s rostov ( located at the mouth of the don river near the black sea ) , nothing suppressed andrei chikatilo 's urge for ` limbic domination ' from overpowering his layers of civilization . chikatilo ( jeffrey demunn ) 's easy victims were paupers , usually children , who rode the interurban train for fun , since they could n't afford anything else . citizenx reminds us that the denials of a rampant soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such ` lambs ' . rostov 's serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years after the police arrested and let him go . the politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere . although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world , in the west , vote-grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter-agency rivalries , stymieing a more coordinated response to crime . in the soviet union of citizenx , however , viktor burakov ( stephen rea ) 's killer department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy . geoffrey demunn plays the psychosexually inadequate chikatilo with faultless but understated authority -- to the point of complete obscurity . in real life , too , chikatilo had a lifetime 's experience blending in and evading capture . his pursuer , on the other hand , sticks out as a strange bird , given to unheralded , naive outbursts . perhaps by design , stephen rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief burakov . rea 's russian accent is impenetrable ; and his burakov is humourless and sullen , at odds with everyone . so it 's donald sutherland who walks away with the picture . sutherland 's col.fetisov , burakov 's boss , and at first his only supporter , is an overly restrained , patient militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations . his reawakening as a logic-driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film 's cornerstone idealism . joss ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik , secretary of communist ideology bondarchuk , overseeing the investigation . naturally , he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect , a communist , in 1984 , a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag , supposedly going home : andrei chikatilo . soon , he replaced burakov with another moscow apparatchik , detective gorbunov ( john wood ) , insisting that the investigation now focus on ` known homosexuals ' . the funniest scene of this sad , sad film comes during bondarchuk 's & gorbunov 's institutionalized harassment : one stupid cop earnestly reports , ` as i suspected , comrade , it 's fornication . i 've made some drawings ' -- cue howling laughter . 5yrs after the bodies began piling up , in 1987 , the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles . the only cooperating soviet psychiatrist was dr aleksandr bukhanovsky ( max von sydow ) , who termed the unsub ` citizenx ' . he later also observed to fetisov & burakov that ` ... together you make a wonderful person ' . we concur . the drawn-out pace , spread over a decade , perfectly captures the institutional inertia of glasnost -- ` openness ' -- that was n't . the contrast with perestroika -- ` restructuring ' -- couldn't 've been greater for the case . although chikatilo was still prowling railway stations , police plans were about to bear fruit . in 1990 , col.fetisov was expeditiously promoted to general . his nemesis bondarchuk disappeared off the scene , allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference . staff , communications , publicity -- suddenly all were available . in just one night of telephoning around , fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the fbi 's serial murder task force at quantico , where , fetisov discovered , staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators . fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief , now ` colonel ' burakov , of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie 's powerhouse watershed scene . fetisov 's is the most tender apology i 've ever seen on film : ` privately , i offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife . i hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance ' , he almost whispers . a hbo production , citizenx is a film of the highest caliber . not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak ( shot exclusively in the most run-down parts of otherwise spectacular budapest ) , but randy edelman 's soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming -- and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality . those who speak hungarian will recognize the many hungarian accents and credits . chikatilo 's actual murders are depicted as bleak , aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world . this makes the murders seem not-entirely-out-of-place -- but of course they were . as president kennedy reminded us , ` we all cherish the futures of our children ' . citizenx communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply . serial rapists rape to dominate ; serial killers kill to dominate . so do some soldiers . such ` limbic dominators ' make poor humans . warning-spoiler : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - the real andrei chikatilo was the world 's most prolific known serial killer . convicted , he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all soviet union death sentences : one shot , in the back of the head . foolishly , such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death . conclusion : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the best outcome is always the prevention of killings , not their prosecution . executions merely guarantee society 's failure to learn from the complex reality of victims ' deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of how/why they died . nor do killers learn regret if they 're dead . vengeance does n't unkill victims . baying for the killer 's blood constitutes nothing better than counter-domination -- once it 's too late . vengeance on behalf of the grieving is n't justice for the deceased -- it 's appeasement of the living . ( 10/10 )
in this little film we have some great characters but a very shallow plot . it is actually nice to watch because singleton does a great job at presenting the esoteric conflicts and the interpersonal relationships . this makes the viewer forget the nonexistent realism that this movie supposedly is for . in fact what we have here is all the possible cliches and stereotypes put on celluloid in a rate higher than that of a soap . definitely not a deep movie ( even if it wants to be ) , but better than an average college movie .
i 'm a big fan of fan of film noir , and this film by otto preminger easily stands as one of the best that i 've seen ! preminger has reunited two of his stars from the hit 'laura ' - gene tierney and dana andrews , for an entirely different sort of crime film . laura was based around love , and this film is based around hate ; as we watch police detective mark dixon , a copper already suffering scrutiny from his superiors for his heavy handed tactics , accidentally kill a suspect and try to pin the murder on a known criminal ; a man by the name of tommy scalisi . the plot is brilliantly worked , and preminger excellently balances several plot points ; but it all comes back down to the main moral implication surrounding our main character . the fact that the film is set in the criminal underground means that the plot is given an excellent base to work from , and director otto preminger expertly captures the sleazier side of life by showing the main characters gambling , beating one another ( and their women ) , shooting and more - and this also helps to offset the film from the earlier 'laura ' , which was very much set in upper class society . the role of mark dixon gives dana andrews one of the most interesting parts of his career . here , we have a character that is difficult to like as he 's so cold - but the fact that we can understand his motives ensures that he 's easy to sympathise with , and that allows the audience the ability to plug into his plight . the character development is well timed , and as we 've follows this character and his motivations throughout the film ; everything makes sense by the end . his co-star is the beautiful gene tierney , who is n't given as much to do in this film as she was in laura ; a film that made tierney its linchpin . she does well with what she 's got , however , and the lead duo 's chemistry is excellent and tierney helps to complete every scene she 's in . i ca n't say that this is a better film than the earlier laura ; that 's a hard act to follow , but this film certainly fits into the film noir formula better than preminger 's earlier film . the film also makes a good comparison piece for laura ; as just about everything in this film is opposite to the 1944 movie , yet it 's all strangely familiar . highly recommended to all !
`` an album of songs so old everyone thinks they 're new . '' this film has the elusive combination of pace and mood that set some films apart from the opening moments . and why not ? towering talent from dame judith dench as a widow who plays saxaphone with a street musician to help him get the songs right , to olympia dukakis as the merry widow living in a scottish castle on the alimony of her many marriages , to ian holm as the drummer who loved all the members of a world war ii all girl ( more or less ) swing band . but wait , there 's more . add in leslie caron on bass , and the incomparable clio laine on lead vocal , at last , and the blonde bombshells are the hottest band in england since the beatles . well , ok , not really , but this movie is a winner . elizabeth ( dench ) spends the whole film trying to reunite the blonde bombshells to play at her granddaughter 's school dance . and before you roll your eyes , imagine how difficult and courageous it would be for a bunch of sexegenarian women to step onstage in front of the britney spears generation following an act called `` open wound . '' in an age when actresses careers are over by the time they 're 30 , most bands ' second album is a greatest hits compilation , and music more than a month old has almost no chance of airplay , it 's great to see real talent , real music and a really good movie come from , where else , the bbc . i love this movie , and i know i 'll watch it many more times , and enjoy it more each time .
italy produced a lot of really great and original horror films in the 1960 's - and this is certainly one of them ! the first thing you will notice about danse macabre is the style of the film . shot in beautiful black and white , and due to director antonio margheriti 's use of lighting ; the film almost looks like it could be a german expressionistic horror film . this , coupled with the horror-filled plot line ensures that danse macabre is a film that truly captures the essence of horror . of course , the fact that the beautiful barbara steele appears in the film does n't harm matters - and the good news continues as , in this film , she gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in the films that made her famous . the plot is very aware of the time in which this was released , and so incorporates the great edgar allen poe . we follow alan foster , a writer who accepts a bet from poe himself and lord blackwood that he ca n't spend an entire night in the latter 's creepy old castle . everyone that has spent the night there previously has died ... and our hero is about to meet the previous wager-takers ! nowadays , horror films do n't tend to focus so much on each shot and the result is that there is n't much beauty left in the genre . it is refreshing , therefore , to see this film . many of the shots here are incredibly beautiful - from the female side of the couple wearing just a see-through skirt , to my personal favourite - a shot of smoke creeping in from under a door . this my first antonio margheriti film , and even after seeing just this one ; it 's obvious that he was one of italy 's premier directors . also interesting is the fact that screenplay was co-written by another of the italian greats ; django creator sergio corbucci . the plot can meander a little too much at times , but there 's always enough atmosphere on hand to make sure that the film never becomes boring - and the fact that it is always intriguing , even when the plot slows down , ensures the same thing . the way that danse macabre utilises the 'haunted house ' theme is both well done and original , and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible . on the whole , fans of italian and/or cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem !
harvey keital 's best performance so far the new century . very nicely photographed , a beautiful snap-shot of pre-castro cuba . the story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an american with hollywood connections . it 's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger , much more complex world that he does n't yet understand.the script is strong and filled with humor , the direction is crisp . over all , a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of latin american cinema . the one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync-sound english rather than spanish - probably to improve sales in the us . unfortunately , this just makes the film a little less convincing . but if you can see beyond this , you will find a heartfelt trip to another world . recommended .
this is a sublime piece of film-making . it flows at just the right pace throughout . the accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear . the humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the largely depressingly tragic nature of the film . however , despite much comment about the inherent tragedy of the storyline it was anything but depressing for me to watch . i thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that i have n't experienced for a long time . that is to say , it is superb and yet without all the common trappings of modern films such as ; sex , violence and unnecessary special effects . 'dan in real life ' lacks nothing for being without the regular vices . it has a fully matured plot that just does n't require , and indeed would be ruined by , any further embellishment . at the same time , the theme is entirely adult . it 's a piece of art in and of itself that encapsulates you entirely and you want for nothing more than it already offers . there are some scenes that feel a bit 'waltons ' but these actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments . the rosier makes way for the tragic which then gives over to the idyllic which turns to the darker etc . this undulating landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability . the peaks and troughs are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they instill . i highly recommend watching this film regardless of what genre you normally enjoy . put aside any prejudices because this is a must see !
noll 's comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments , often with expletives , to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing . there is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues , using more language than necessary . this guy should never have been given a thesaurus . cut to noll and you know you 're in for a treat ! the way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a `` lost era '' . nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living , much less took care of issues like medical care . the use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done .
it 's been a while since i 've watched this movie , and the series , but now i 'm refreshing my memory ! this was a very funny movie based on the classic series ! johnny knoxville and seann william scott were hilarious together . bo and luke duke help uncle jesse run moonshine in the general lee . when boss hogg forces the dukes off their farm , bo and luke sneak around hogg 's local construction site and find samples of coal . they soon realize that boss hogg is gon na strip-mine hazzard county , unless the dukes can stop him , with the help of their beautiful cousin , daisy . my only two problems with the movie was that burt reynolds was n't right for the part of boss hogg , and sheriff rosco p. coltrane was way too serious . other than that , i highly recommend the dukes of hazzard ! ! !
i just saw this at the toronto film festival , and i hope it gets wide release because i want to see it again ! it is a character-driven film , and andrew and david are more than up to the task . any discussion of the plot might be considered spoilers , so i 'll just say that the storyline is clever , the acting is superb , and the effects are amazing . well-filmed and well-paced too . one of the best films i have seen in ages , and very refreshing in this summer of dreary movies . it had the audience laughing the whole time . see it if you can . ( i particularly liked the `` candy bar ! candy bar ! '' scene . )
tsui hark 's visual artistry is at its peek in this movie . unfortunately the terrible acting by ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung ( i felt the urge to strangle her while watching this , it 's that bad : ) made it difficult to watch at times . this movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department . when i first saw this , my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that i 've never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of chinese historical kung-fu novels ! without a doubt this is one of the best-looking chinese historical kung-fu epic ever made . but alas , tsui hark has n't improved much in the writing department , and the story and dialog are rather juvenile ( his apparent obsession with the silly and overly-long depiction of the evil guys did n't help either ) . to make it worse , this movie is very badly cast . they decided to use the `` hot '' popular hong kong idols as lead characters , but unfortunately both ekin cheng and especially cecilia cheung are totally unsuited for historical kung-fu dramas because they lack the nobility and mystique that such characters are supposed to embody . adam cheng siu-chow and brigitte lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better . i wish that someday zhang yi-mou and tsui hark can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and story-telling poetry of zhang ...
i loved this movie since i was 7 and i saw it on the opening day . it was so touching and beautiful . i strongly recommend seeing for all . it 's a movie to watch with your family by far . my mpaa rating : pg-13 for thematic elements , prolonged scenes of disastor , nudity/sexuality and some language .
i only saw it once . this happened in 1952 , i was seven , the movie 13 . we were so young ... but i kept in mind , forever , the strong moments of gunga 's sacrifice . i realized that time how much a people can be hardly submitted and used by a foreign nation . under these historical circumstances , in the movie , the personal relation of friendship , a kind of friendship that ignores itself , the one raised between people who share daily life , who see each other faces , who knows each other names , but belong to different worlds , can only make appears . then , in the most critical moments a troubling question emerges : `` whom are we , in first , supposed to be loyal ? `` , which people , family , motherland , the person you know close to you ? . you do not have time to give a perfect answer , urgency is there , and it is for life or death . gunga-din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself . somewhere , in a confuse manner , a problem remains unsolved , the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies , just one life , nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today , because this death , this unique vanishing life i lived it , i shared with my child unconditional friendship . it was lived by the spectator i was . that day i loose gunga-din for ever . as i left behind , later , my pretty childhood , as i left from then so many worlds i lived in . i left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit i did n't expect to do this morning when getting up .
9/10- 30 minutes of pure holiday terror . okay , so it 's not that scary . but it sure is fun . the crypt keeper ( john kassir ) tales a tale of holiday fear , giving us all christmas goose ... gossebumps that is . bwahahahahha . you should really be careful what you axe santa for . have a scary christmas and a happy new fear . okay i 'll stop . okay , so in the story , a greedy wife ( best screamer in the world , mary ellen trainor ) kills her husband ( marshall bell , the coach who gets towel whipped to death in anoes 2 ) for the money . but , her plan is ruined when a crazy killer dressed in a santa suit ( larry `` dr. giggles '' drake ) comes her way . if you look it up on youtube , you can watch it for free , but most of you have already seen this ( my third viewing ) . but if you have n't seen it , i suggest you do .
this episode from the first season slightly edges towards controversy with the whole gender bending angle.i imagine there would have been a significant amount of editing before this was finished to appease censors . the story itself is original and well written and the directing is complemented by the fine acting . ( nicholas lea makes his x-files debut though not as agent krycek but as a victim called michael ) i especially enjoyed the built up to and the ending itself . its different but enjoyable.ignore any bad reviews you may hear.watch it for yourself and make judgement then
i do n't hand out ten star ratings easily . a movie really has to impress me , and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that . furthermore , this trilogy has come together so nicely , that i believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time . though all three films could not be any more different from the ludlum novels , they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement . the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete , yet i could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours . from the moment that the opening title appeared , i knew we were in for a ride . paul greengrass has done it again . everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again : the action , the dialogue , and of course the shaky camera . however for me , that last one was never a problem . i think it adds to the suspense . i will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd , simply because it is genius . it is a perfectly satisfying conclusion , and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie , and altogether , an unforgettable trilogy .
i instantly fell in love with `` pushing daisies '' . this show manages to put a smile on my face with it 's great storytelling , witty dialog and great acting . but that 's not all : it also manages to keep you until the end . the basic idea behind the show - bringing people back to life with one touch , ending the undead status with a second - is interesting and could still be in later seasons . but the suspenseful murder cases , the unique look of the show and the highly proficient narrator add to the experience . but `` pushing daisies '' is more than it 's parts . it has a certain charm that i really enjoy and i 'm looking forward to enter the world of ned and chuck for a second season .
it is not the same as the other films about dancing . a few normal people found themselves from dancing . unlike the dancing films in hollywood , the characters in this film are not handsome or hot young people . they are someone that you may see everyday in your offices . they are some depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams from dancing . this touches me very deeply .
so i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene , with very few shows i simply will not watch . this show , however , i would recommend to anyone . quite possibly the most original series to date , it ; s got just about everything i could ask for . a side story , so to speak , about an unconditional love that will not be admitted to , a very blatant comedy , and a very well put together voice acting cast ( both japanese and american translation ) . if not for the terribly funny aspect to it , it would be , just another anime . more or less , as i have noticed , a 'love it or hate it ' , very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a distaste for it . original to the core , with everything you could ask for in an afternoon , bet the house on this series . i 'm ready to assure you that you will enjoy it .
david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with ` house of games , ' a character study fraught with psychological overtones , in which a psychiatrist is lured into the dark world of the confidence game . margaret ford ( lindsay crouse ) has a successful practice and has written a best-selling novel , 'driven . ' still , she is somewhat discontented with her own personal life ; there 's an emptiness she can neither define nor resolve , and it primes her vulnerability . when a patient , billy hahn ( steven goldstein ) , confides to her during a session that he owes big money to some gamblers , and that they 're going to kill him if he does n't pay , she decides to intervene on his behalf . this takes her to the ` house of games , ' a seedy little dive where she meets mike ( joe mantegna ) , a charismatic con-man who wastes no time before enticing her into his world . instead of the ` twenty-five large ' that billy claimed he owed , mike shows her his book , and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars . and mike agrees to wipe the slate clean , if she 'll agree to do him one simple favor , which involves a card game he has going on in the back room . in the middle of a big hand , mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes ; while he is gone , her job is to watch for the ` tell ' of one of the other players . by this time , not only margaret , but the audience , as well , is hooked . the dialogue , and mamet 's unique style and the precise cadence with which his actors deliver their lines , is mesmerizing . as mike leads margaret through his compelling , surreal realm of existence , and introduces her to the intricacies of the con game , we are swept right along with her . from that first memorable encounter , when he demonstrates what a ` tell ' is and how it works , to the lessons of the ` short con , ' to the stunning climax of this film , mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless . and nothing is what it seems . in the end , margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature , and about herself . she changes ; and whether or not it 's for the better is open to speculation . mantegna is absolutely riveting in this film ; he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows , and does . crouse also turns in an outstanding performance here ; you feel the rigid , up-tight turmoil roiling beneath that calm , self-assured exterior , and when her experiences with mike induce the change in her , she makes you feel how deeply it has penetrated . she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does , and makes you understand it , as well . the dynamic supporting cast includes mike nussbaum ( joey ) , lilia skala ( dr. littauer ) , j.t . walsh ( the businessman ) , ricky jay ( george ) and william h. macy ( sergeant moran ) . ` house of games ' is the quintessential mamet ; he 's written and directed a number of high-caliber plays and films since , and will no doubt grace us with more in the future . but this film will be the one that defines him ; and you can go to the dictionary and look it up . you 'll find it under ` perfection . ' this is one great movie you do not want to miss . i rate this one 10/10 .
should this be an american movie i 'd rate it 7 : we 've seen this before . being this an argentinean movie , and being myself argentine , i 'd like to give it a 10 , since it 's the kind of quality i 'd been hoping -rather than expecting- for . it 's superb quality is astonishing , given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd world ... i ca n't forget the scene when díaz forces silverstein 's fiancé to confess -you know what i mean if you saw the movie . i think that 's the key moment of the movie , not surprising maybe , yet original . that 's when the real action begins . before watching a movie i always try to gather some previous information . being this a mainstream , satyric , commercial one , i press `` play '' and make a suspension of reality and logic , i 'd say the best state of mind to enjoy movies like this . it 's impossible to discuss the plausibility of the whole plot , yet it 's believable in a certain way . as for me , i could n't stop laughing at every single joke and commentary - '' sos malo '' ( `` you 're mean '' ) ... put in the mouth of díaz , the greatest one . i 'm rather tired of seeing movies `` designed for '' peretti . i know he 's a superb actor , but sometimes i feel his roles unfairly opaque the rest , luis luque 's role in this case . i 'm not very fond of argentine television , so i have n't seen much work from luque , but it 's pretty obvious that he 's an excellent performer . his physical role , his stares , his content attitude in this movie made me fall in love with his performance . i think his role should need some upgrading , just to let him show us how great he can be ! i do n't know whether szifrón is planning to make a sequel or not . i know he wo n't make it if it 's to follow the rule that `` second parts were never good '' , so if he makes it , i 'll surely go see it . and i hope that , in the future , takes into account the possibility to give peretti 's counterparts the same chances to develop their roles . great movie , great performances , and lots of laughs !
i did n't know what to expect from 'ned kelly ' , but absolutely loved it . it was dark , dramatic and gripping . it also felt very authentic , i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800 's . i 've never been much of a heath ledger fan , having only seen him in teen type movies , however he is quite compelling in this role . ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity , showing us how an highly spirited boy became australia 's most notorious killer . naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kelly 's society lover . highly recommended - and that 's from an aussie !
i remember the first time i saw this movie -- i was in the office working over the weekend & the tv was on for background noise . but i gradually found myself more & more engaged in this movie i 'd never seen or heard of , until i was completely absorbed . a matter of life & death ( the british title -- stairway to heaven in the us ) is delightful , compelling , whimsical , & moving , all in one superbly-written , well-acted , perfectly-directed package . it 's a classic that really does rank right up there with casablanca , it 's a wonderful life , gone with the wind , citizen kane , & chariots of fire . why has it never received the same public notice & video-store prominence ? fortunately , some knowledgeable critics have put it on their `` top 100 of all time '' lists . there is hope -- 1940 's fantasia was n't a hit 'til the '60s , & the wizard of oz was a dud at the box office , but made a hit by tv . buy it -- rent it -- watch it -- demand it ! you wo n't be disappointed !
the menagerie parts one and two was the only 2-parter during the 3-year run of the original trek series and it was because roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot `` the cage . '' the move was made out of necessity , to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced ( such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time ) . one positive outcome back then was that audiences , unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier , were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters , as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a tv epic spanning a dozen years of starfleet history ( though they still used terms such as 'united space fleet ' in these early episodes ) . the wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot : the enterprise is diverted to starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon spock is a suspect in these shenanigans . astonishingly , though even mccoy belabors the fact that spock 's vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible , it does turn out that spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain , pike , now horribly crippled . well , spock is half human , we tend to forget . or has he simply gone mad ? it may very well be , for he 's directing enterprise to talos iv , a planet so off-limits it 's the subject of the only known death penalty on starfleet 's books . when the jig is up , there 's a great scene of spock surrendering to a flabbergasted mccoy , as uhura looks on in shock . even kirk , usually steady as a captain should be , does n't know what to make of his first officer 's illogical conduct . in the 3rd and final acts , we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the enterprise from 13 years prior , when capt . pike was commanding and spock was one of his officers . we really do n't know where all this is going and what spock hopes to accomplish - and that 's another thing that makes this a very good 2-parter - we really need to find out what it 's all about in the 2nd part . not only is spock facing severe penalties , but it looks like kirk 's career may be finished , as well . double jeopardy , folks . this is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts ( none were available in the earlier `` the enemy within '' when the crafts were really needed ) . there 's also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase - this was the only way to visualize such things back then . finally , check out kirk 's smug approach at the start of the episode - boy , do things go sideways on him as the story progresses .
`` tintin and i '' first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary . the photography and the editing are truly breath-taking ( almost anti-dogma ) . we follow the life of tintin drawer hergé through an open-hearted interview from 1971 . the tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological fights of the twentieth century . in the midst of these hergé has his own demons to fight with , and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfection . even though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from tintin albums and also some reconstructions and reading of passages from the albums , the story of hergé is told entirely through interviews and archive material , and never through reconstructions . hergé lived the turbulent life of a true , suffering artist . but the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again .
as i mentioned previously , john carpenter 's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies i can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by ( the other being the classic conan the barbarian ) . it so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was michael meyers , whom i eventually befriended ( imaginary friend ) to keep him from killing me in my sleep . now that is terror for a 10 year old . it is a horror classic and i am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves . the most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works , perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious . this all could happen . it is n't in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country ( as most modern horror is , i.e . hostel , touristas , cry wolf , saw , etc ) . at times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations . i believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head . it still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create . so we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety . carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday , middle class , suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on halloween and kills his sister . he then spends the next 15 years in an institution ( which we thankfully do not experience ) only to escape and return to his hometown , the infamous haddonfield . on his way he kills and kills . the child 's name is michael meyers , though he is not a person . john carpenter uses michael meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia . in the bastion of american safety and security , chaos can still strike . michael ceased to be a person once he killed . he is not a serial killer , human being or psychopath . he is as unstoppable force . the generic overalls , bleached-white shatner mask , and lack of any dialog other then some breathing , helps to dehumanize and complete michael 's generification . this is the source of all his power . he is faceless , speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos . this is helped by the cinematography ( post card effect ) , a lack of information/motivation/explanation and the veteran narrative experience of donald pleasence ( dr. loomis ) . his over the top performance and uneasiness sells `` the shape '' . this is also the first film performance by jamie lee curtis as laurie strode , the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds ( at least for a little bit ) . though this is n't the first movie of this new niche of horror films ( black christmas came out 4 years earlier ) , it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing . if you have n't been scared by horror movies in a long time ( like me ) , this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack . i highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of john carpenter 's career .
i recently ( may 2008 ) discovered that this childhood favorite was available as a dvd . although i 've seen a great deal of high quality movies since then ( late 70 's ( i was 10 in 1978 ) ) , this three-episode , low budget thing still stands strong . what 's fun is that i now watched it with my 10 year old daughter , and she experiences just the same as i remember from back then : the creepy music ( she had to hold my hand , even though she 's been raised with watching lotr and resident evil ) , the ever changing theories of who the culprit actually is , and also complaining about the theatrical voices from an era before norway discovered the difference between stage acting and movie acting . this is the one and only good science fiction movie ( or series ) ever made in norway . and it 's still worth watching .
what do you do with a 14-inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder , and then died of aids ? you make a movie , of course . the probable reason why it was n't made earlier is the fact that eddie nash would have been in the way of its production . so it 's no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after nash was sent to prison . the best thing about the movie is its quick pace . there is no time wasted on unnecessary crap . and why would it be ? there is too much good material here to require dull filler scenes.the cast is good . kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies , so here was finally a role quite suitable for him . bosworth is cute so it 's irrelevant how she acts ( she 's solid ) , and mcdermott , who is otherwise quite annoying , is rather good , to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that i did n't recognize him at first . ( i wish they did that to cruise in every movie so i would n't have to watch his dumb face . ) i utterly failed to recognize christina applegate , and would n't have known she was in it , had i not seen her name in the end-credits . kudrow is charming as ever , a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role . ( btw , `` friends '' is the worst tv sitcom of all time . ) the only casting choices that were questionable were an early near-cameo by carrie fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron janeane garofalo . you thought i 'd include paris hilton , too , did n't you ? no , i think hilton is the ideal choice in her 10-second appearance as a dumb whore . because the film is about decadence , among other things  and about a porn actor  she fits in perfectly .
bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie , a description of the revolutionary movement in italy , but that seems more metaphor than reality . well , almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor . the revolutionaries , of whom we see and about whom we learn very little , might as well be mafiosi . out with the old and in with the new . andrea 's papa , a psychoanalyst , seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values -- morally upright , unperturbed , clean and tidy , thoroughly ritualized . giullia , the girlfriend of a revolutionary , seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to muster up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands . ( i 'm guessing here . ) andrea , the adolescent boy , seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some unquiet way `` upatz . '' he 's respectful of his father but disobedient too . he loves giullia , or so we assume , although he 's not really old enough to have learned how to manage his reflexes optimally , but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final exams . his course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as `` media . '' he 's the man in between , who knows the meaning of gradualism , who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming . most of this is summed up during the oral part of his finals when he is asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from `` antigone , '' which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free will . that brings us -- by no particular course that i 'm aware of -- to marushka detmars . she brings to mind a new yorker cartoon of a few years ago . two hippos are neck-deep in the river , staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank , and one hippo says to the other , `` i hate her . '' she 's a good actress . ( let me get that out of the way . ) but so is everyone else in the film . she carries with her , in her speech and manner , the rich glitter of outright lunacy . and it all comes from the actress too , not from directorial aid . detmars is n't nuts the way catherine deneuve was nuts in `` repulsion . '' the walls do n't turn to rubber and grow hands . instead , we see her animated -- sometimes too animated . and she gives us shocking jolts when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a looming thunderstorm is threatening . a critic described her as sultry , but that 's probably not the word he was searching for . she 's compellingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair , her wide white ready grin , her impulsive giggles . and her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient egyptian tombs . the sexy parts are pretty erotic , not so much because one of them is explicit , but because we 've gotten to know the characters involved . ( it 's more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick . ) actually there is n't that much sex . there is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time . at least real time for an eighteen-year-old boy . the young man who plays andrea is fine too , which is a necessary thing , because the film depends almost entirely on him and giullia . they have to carry it and they do . if it were not for their performances , i 'm not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is . it could easily have been turned into a rather slow , boring romance . worth it .
i think that this film adds to diversity and is very accurate in terms of historic reconstruction . the way it shows the various communities leaving together in thailand is very interesting ... the portuguese , the japanese , and the various communities being managed by the king . the plots around the court are as usual a struggle for power with a lot of treason . the wardrobe is fine . the film is also done locally in thailand in a reasonable production . the scene with the elefant as executors is very interesting . it is fun and i think that is also usable in schools for its historic accuracy because it shows that the european in asia were subjects of the local kings in way very different from the traditional hollywood perspective .
just got through watching this version of `` samhain '' , and even though i still like it , it 's nothing like the `` rough cut '' version i have . if you check the message board , you 'll see an apology from the director for this cut down version , 79 minutes. , and he says he had nothing to do with this r-rated trimmed down edit with a completely new screwed up ending . christian really does n't need to distant himself that much , because the basic gore elements still stand up , even though highly trimmed down . this is a damn shame , because this had the potential of being one of the goriest and best gore films in years . it still has the porn stars , and the inbreds , and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen . i 'm just glad i have that `` rough cut '' , because to me , it 's a jewel for any gorehounds library . christian viel definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods , and hopefully his next project will be better produced . the idiots had a near classic in their hands , and screwed it up for everybody . `` samhain '' may be one of the most controversial and mishandled horror movies ever , and too bad gorehounds did n't get to see what the director intended . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * just so you know what you missed , this is my review based upon the `` work print '' of samhain . the movie runs a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops . there is absolutely no music soundtrack , and some of the scenes have no audio on the dialog , because i think they are meant to be looped in later . however , most of the movie does have audio with sound affects , and when an effect or scene is missing , a message appears as a cue for insertion when the movie is completed . it 's exactly as it says , a `` rough cut '' , but the only uncut version of `` samhain '' you are ever likely to see . reason , because the gore is extremely graphic , much more than even an nc-17 would allow . yes there are a few porn stars , but they are just there for the killing , and to add a little sugar and spice . the story is pretty standard , american tourists on a vacation in ireland and end up staying in a home in the middle of the woods . an area that is heavy on folklore , involving the ancient druids and the celebration of samhain , or as we call it halloween . ( spooky ) the movie starts off with a huge dose of gore , as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants . this is a great gore scene , as the guy find his girl hanging from a cliff , with her crying for help . all he sees is her head , arms , and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls her up , she has been completely sliced in two . this is what i would call extreme gore , with entrails , blood , and severed limbs all over the place . we are in herschell gordon lewis territory here folks , except the effects look much more realistic . i 'm going to just skip the story , because it 's your standard stalk and kill plot . the next gore scene is something to behold , as the boyfriend from the first killing is taken to a cave like location ( tcm-2 stuff ) , and bound to a table . this geek then cuts all of his limbs off ( off camera , with a cue to insert a scene ) , and then we see his torso on a barbecue pit , turning slowly over a fire , and the torso has a hard-on ( if you can believe that ) . yes , very bad taste , gross , gruesome , you find the right word , and it will probably fit too . then later jenna jameson , her beautiful body and all , is cut from neck to crotch , and all her entrails are pulled out in graphic glee , and her blood drains into a pot . yummy , a real turn on huh ? but the best gore scene happens inside the house , and i have to admit , this is one of the best gore scenes i have seen . this guy ( does n't matter who ) is caught from behind from a geek , and cut open at the ass hole . the geek then puts his hands in and rips out all the guys entrails , intestines , and what the hell ever else there is , right from his asshole . this goes on forever , as the guy is screaming and more and more innards are pulled out laying all over the bathroom floor . this is so extreme , so over the top , that i found myself laughing all to hell . obviously , you will never ever see this scene on a proper dvd , imo , along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes . so , what to think of all of this . well , first of all , even though i doubt this movie would ever be released in this totally uncut presentation , it makes this `` rough cut '' a rare jewel for gorehounds . yes , it 's a little difficult at first , with no soundtrack , a few scenes to still be inserted , and credits that have missing names all over the place . but that 's what makes this so unique , and i would n't trade it for anything right now . extreme gore , yes yes , extreme extreme gore . this makes `` haute tension '' look like a disney movie .
this film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life . we get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight . a very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war do n't just happen on the front . luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great-grandparents , grandparents or parents went through during a war . this film , i think , is a small thank you . peter outerbridge looks amazingly like a young peter o'toole and russell crowe is absolutely charming and as australian as he can be . it 's definitely worth listening to him recite `` high flight '' and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with shakespeare .
basically , this movie is one of those rare movies you either hate and think borders on suicide as the next best thing to do , rather than having to sit through it for two hours . or , as in my case , you see it as a kult hit , one of those movies wherein the humour , the plot , the acting , is actually very hidden but for those of us willing to go looking for it , trusting the director well , the reward is : u laugh your a .. of ! ! the fact that u have to find the things mentioned above , actually makes the movie even more funny , because u get the impression the director is n't even aware of how funny his movie is , which does n't seem likely and therein lies the intelligence at the helm of this magnificient project called : spaced invaders ! !
enormous fun for both adults and children , this film works on numerous levels : there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good ( yet subtle ) jokes for adults . glenn close is at her sublimely evil best as cruella ( ` call me ella ' ) de ville . after three years in dr. pavlov 's behaviour modification clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppy-skin fur she had so intensely desired . she even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits . but it would n't be a dalmatian ' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification . and now she needs one extra puppy ( hence 102 dalmatians ) to complete her nefarious scheme this time round . ioan gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the ` second chance ' dog shelter . though he was in ` titanic ' and in last year 's television version ( as pip ) of ` great expectations ' i did n't recognize him ; well , he was fifth officer lowe ' in ` titanic ' and i did n't see ` great expectations ' so i am not terribly surprised . gerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier-pawn of cruella . he prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well . his 'wicked witch of the west ' homage is hilarious . tim mcinnerny is superb is cruella 's not-so-evil henchman  he was also alonzo , ' cruella 's butler , in ` 101 dalmatians ' and you may also recognize him from all of the ` black adder ' brit-coms . he plays his usual bumbling , good-hearted , somewhat dim-witted character to great effect . oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film . this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed ( note her handcuffs when she is being released from the behaviour modification clinic ) and worthy of such an over-the-top character . her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nomination . animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans : it ca n't be done . suffice it to say that ` 102 dalmatians ' is even better than the film version of ` 101 dalmatians ' that came out in 1996 . there is a lot to like here : from the sight gags , the dialogue , and the costumes to the casting - it is a good film for the whole family .
let 's set one thing straight : this movie does not seek to redefine the genre , it 's not dr. strangelove o young frankenstein . it 's a silly flick , with three great female leads ( ca n't remember any other comedy with similar characteristics ) , rachel dracht and amy poehler from snl and indie queen parker posey , charming as ever . the story is basic : the three gals were `` losers '' in college , and are still after wards it . poehler is a dog trainer ( who ca n't even get a date with a blind guy ) , posey is an assistant for a senator ( who `` has n't been touched by a man since clinton was in office '' ... i catched that one several minutes later ... i 'm a little slow , ok ! ) , and dracht has a gay fiancée ( seth meyers from snl , funny ) . they have to prevent the `` uncool '' daughter of the senator ( the always cute amber tamblyn from the tv series `` joan of arcadia '' ) to embarrass her during spring break . so of course they have to go to watch over her , and some hilarity ensues . all in all , a light , simple comedy , quite short , and quite enjoyable
i agree with `` jerry . '' it 's a very underrated space movie ( of course , how many good low-budget ones are n't underrated ? ) if i remember correctly , the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation ( but not `` rip-off '' ) of 2001 , because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man , who had somehow been turned into a computer . and like hal , they tried to disconnect his `` mind '' , but not the mechanical parts of him , and as with hal , it led to disaster . there is at least one funny moment . when the christopher cary character , who ca n't find any food , finds the abandoned pet bird , there 's a kind of ominous moment , but then the obvious thing does n't happen after all .
if you love kung-fu films and you have n't seen this movie , you are cheating yourself . this movie is one of the only kung-fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film . normally , it takes a die-hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films , but this one has it all ! the story is well told , and complete . the fight scenes are great , and tend to end before you 're completely bored with them ( unlike crouching tiger ) . throw in a little mystery and torture and you 've got yourself one heck of a movie . see this one at all costs . heck , my wife even enjoyed it . wu du it ! 9 out of 10
for a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance . it is done with style and class showing modesty 's early days as a refugee and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world . i think it is a very honest/true portrayal of her character exactly as the writer peter o'donnell intended . alexandra staden as modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice . she acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of cool/intelligent/innocence . and full marks to tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role - much more believeable to have a new face creating the part . i 'm looking forward to the next film .
this stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all . james stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized winchester in a shootout , only to lose it in a robbery . the story details stewart 's pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film . the rifle changes hands time after time , as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence . the picture has plenty of action and suspense as stewart closes in on his quarry . a great cast supports stewart here , namely stephen mcnally , dan duryea , millard mitchell , john mcintire and jay c. flippen . shelley winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure . tony curtis and rock hudson , teen heartthrobs in later years , have brief but good roles .
this has to be one of the best movies to come out of hk in a long time , i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title . loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with sam lee 's impossibly believable insane behavior and edison 's portrayal of a killer machine , which totally reversed his normal idol image . i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie . however , i must warn you , this is also an equally depressing movie , as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own , and struggling to breathe . makes you think about what is life about really .
i do n't know what it is with this movies . but movies about history or religion are always criticised by their accuracy . of course it 's not 100 % accurate . it 's difficult to make 100 % accurate films nowadays when even the `` experts '' disagree with each other . therefore i rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuracies . so i start by saying that i liked this mini serie . but i do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast . the series should have been a three part story , his childhood being the first part . but if they did n't have more money to shoot more story who am i to criticise that ? ? ? there 's only one real problem i have with this movie and that 's the fact that it 's told in a history book way . especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened . i rather would have liked to see hitler more humane ( more scenes where he doubts himself etc. ) . noah taylor did that more in the movie 'max ' which seem to work better i think . nevertheless i 'm glad this was made and own it on dvd . just to remember more vividly what happened and see carlyle giving his best . 7.5/10
this was my second time watching the film ( via the french-language version as opposed to the first , which was dubbed in italian ) and i feel that it improves on subsequent viewings . a compelling if slowly built-up character study that 's beautifully shot and with the parisian settings being equally impressive . in the long run , it 's not top-grade polanski and i would rank it at number 9 in his filmography but it 's still a confident mix of subtle chills and , surprisingly , often broad comedy . it also features a fine cast , all of whom are in good form , but especially isabelle adjani , melvyn douglas and jo van fleet . even so , i 'm a bit baffled by the sudden compulsion for trelkovsky to 'change ' into the previous tenant ; apart from the owner of the café opposite the apartment building , where he is given whatever simone used to have without asking him if he wished any different , there is little to indicate ( as far as i could discern , anyway ) that this is what everybody wanted of him ! okay , so he found simone 's belongings still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove him to wear her dresses and make himself up as her ( even if he apparently started doing this unconsciously ) ? following his nightmarish visions in the bathroom , the last section of the film ( where adjani all but disappears ) is almost anti-climactic - especially the scene where the landlord and the other tenants witness his attempted suicide as if it were a night at the opera , a concept which had already been used 46 years earlier by jean cocteau in the blood of a poet ( 1930 ) ! the ending , then , is at once predictable and unresolved : just what made the two occupants of this particular apartment jump out of the window ? ! ; i remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well , and i 'm sorry to say it 's no clearer now ! mind you , the film 's first two-thirds are pretty solid but i wish that polanski had been less reliant on obscure plot points throughout .
kate beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming emma in this tv-adaptation of jane austen´s novel . when i read that novel i was sometimes quite doubtful whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story : for honestly , she is so terribly self-righteous and scheming that one is tempted to dislike her seriously . kate beckinsale´s interpretation , however , saves emma from herself so to speak : she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view , and one can´t help but give in and like ( not to say love ) her in spite of her less amiable qualities . kate beckinsale is the main , but not the only , reason why this tv-series is so delightful ; raymond coulthard is perfect as mr. frank churchill , expressing this character´s personal magnetism to the full ( which is all the more conspicuous because of this role being not very well handled by ewan mcgregor in the 1996-screen adaptation of emma ) , and mark strong , samantha morton , bernard hepton , and olivia williams are all as they should be in their respective roles . this production is , in short , a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure .
i approach films about talking animals with care . for every wonderful one like babe , you get an equally poor one like the dreadful remake of homeward bound : the incredible journey . or in the case of cats & dogs , you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential . when i heard about paulie , the premise of a wisecracking parrot did n't exactly fill me with confidence . but i found the film a pleasant surprise . and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising . a russian janitor , misha vilyenkov ( tony shaloub ) gets a job in a research laboratory . one day , he hears singing coming from the basement . and when he investigates , he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out . misha becomes fascinated with the bird , especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing , it can talk . and not a few phrases either . its a parrot you can actually make conversation with . the parrot is called paulie ( voiced by jay mohr ) , and recognises a fellow castaway in misha . wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement , misha convinces paulie to tell him his life story . which all began when he was a baby , and in the care of marie , a five year old girl with a stutter . the two of them became birds of a feather ( ok , bad pun ! ) . when marie 's parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird , they considered sending him away . and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly . desperate to be reunited with her , paulie begins a long journey across america , which includes a diverse number of new owners , flying great distances , and even ending up behind bars . of a cage that is ! paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by dreamworks in the late 90s . and although it was n't afforded the same recognition or box-office success of babe , paulie succeeds on quite a few levels , and is an occasional work of striking intelligence . jay mohr 's stand-up style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie . he never plays the part as too smug , even if he is a bit of a smart aleck . paulie 's worldly , but he is also naive in his way . because he 's lived a rather sheltered life with marie , when he 's taken away , he has to fend for himself for the first time . and when he falls into the hands of different owners , they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie , which he believes . only for those promises to be broken time and again . paulie is admittedly a little episodic . it follows the eclectic people paulie ends up with , and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie . he first winds up in a pawn shop , where he is adopted by ivy ( gena rowlands ) , a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners . she sympathises with paulie 's situation , and drives an rv across america to find marie . paulie is an occasionally very touching film . his scenes with ivy are some of the best . wonderful moments of paulie perched on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers . the way she instills in him the need for hope is great , and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought-provoking : `` there are things in life you put off , because you think you 're gon na do them later . but the real thing ivy taught me is you got ta live like there may not be a later . '' the scene where ivy passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heart-rending moment . and the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon , soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film 's over . despite the occasional sad moment , there are plenty of laughs to be had . paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a spanish outdoor restaurant . the animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number . and paulie even gets to have a romance . which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief ( played by mohr as well ) . that may be the only complaint i have . as soon as you get comfortable with one situation , the film then moves paulie on to another . the scene where paulie is taught to steal money from atm machines is funny , but a little disturbing too . i 'm amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film . and paulie 's diamond robbery is very mission impossible . he 's caught in the act , and shipped off to the lab for animal testing , where he 's remained ever since . the story finally comes full circle at the lab , where misha vows to help paulie . of course they do find marie . but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity , i was left numb for several minutes . paulie may never get the longevity babe has , but i believe its an equally brilliant film . the same laughs . the same flawless effects . and the same surprising intelligence . a minor gem .
i do n't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of delights for your heart . i enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie -- but that did not disappoint me at all . it will not only touch your heart but it 's such a good family friendly film -- we need many more like these !
rko had a reputation for making folksy , homespun pieces of americana . anne shirley ( as dawn o'day ) had been in films since she was a toddler . by 1933 she was in limbo - having played ann dvorak as a child in `` three on a match '' ( 1932 ) and a `` flower girl '' in both `` this side of heaven '' and `` the key '' both in 1934 . george nicholls jnr remembered anne 's work from a previous film and that 's how she got this part . she also adopted anne shirley as her stage name . the memorable stories are there - lady of shallot in a leaky boat , the `` stolen '' brooch , the `` red hair '' incident . anne was so right for the role of the chatty , heartwarming orphan . she was heartbreaking in her intensity , her eagerness to please and also her fiery temper . o.p . heggie was wonderful as the understanding matthew cuthbert and helen westley was fine as the firm marilla . tom brown was an excellent gilbert blythe . gertrude messinger , who had also been in films as a small child was fine as diana barry . sara haden proved she could play someone other than aunt millie in the andy hardy series , was mrs. barry .

the only part lacking in this movie is shue 's part as the daughter wanting to follow in her `` aunt 's '' footsteps as a daytime soap star . otherwise it would be a perfect 10 . it seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script - i have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing was n't taking place in parts . it was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with you . it 's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once . i 'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose . you 'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely , 'nurse nan ' has a little secret she 'd rather not have shared with you . if you love daytime soaps or despise them , this move pokes fun in all the right places .
what can i say ? this is one of the most perfect films ever made . its a throwback to the glitxy , sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s .. but with a modern touch.the screenplay bursts with wit , charm , humor and tenderness , the cinematograpy is breathtaking ( nyc never looked so beautiful ) , and of course there is the cast ! dudley moore turns in the performance of his career as loveable , drunken arthur bach . he is also wistful and real .. one of the film 's best lines is his poignant `` not everyone who drinks is a poet ... some of us drink because we 're not poets . '' the great sir john gielgud won a much deserved oscar for his splendid performance as hobson , arthur 's valet and caretaker.although he considered it a `` take the money and run role '' , he brings to the character all the talent , experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian . the supporting cast is also out of thisworld , from geraldine fitzgerald 's sassy grandma bach to stephen elliott 's bombastic mafioso . the score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly.the only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned .
i read schneebaum 's book ( same title as this film ) when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of `` otherness '' ( his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved ) to a way of living a decent life . his subsequent books were not as powerful , but showed his continuing quest . his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60 's , but his honesty and openness about it were welcome . this movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man , but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence ( which is not a morally positive term , in this case ) that occurs when `` civilized '' men intrude on traditional societies . even so , schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness .
a super comedy series from the 1990s ( two series were made in total ) that suffered in the uk ratings due to poor scheduling . when you are up against established comedies like 'minder ' , even the best new comedies are going to struggle to get noticed . luckily , i caught the series from episode one and followed it avidly . i mentioned it to friends and family at the time , but everyone seemed to have been watching something else . very , very frustrating . anyway , i loved both series and never forgot it . then i looked it up on the internet and found that an ultra-fan was trying to get both series released 'on his own ' . well , both series are now available on dvd . http : //www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_s1.htm
i am a very big jim carrey fan . i laughed my ass off during liar liar and ace ventura . i also like him in his serious movies , especially truman show . this one is a cross between his very funny side , and his serious side . he is of course very funny in this movie , but there are parts that are very serious , and he pulls it off with a lot of ease . he is truely a multi-function actor . as for the rest of the cast , i was happy with jennifer aniston 's acting . i think she is more than just a couple of nice tits and great ass . morgan freeman makes a very cool god . as for steven carell , his limited scenes are very funny , especially in the anchor scene . overall , i would have to rate this a 9 . good acting , funny script , and some very serious situations make this a very good film .
* * attention spoilers * * first of all , let me say that rob roy is one of the best films of the 90 's . it was an amazing achievement for all those involved , especially the acting of liam neeson , jessica lange , john hurt , brian cox , and tim roth . michael canton jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonor that men can represent in themselves . but alas ... it constantly , and unfairly gets compared to `` braveheart '' . these are two entirely different films , probably only similar in the fact that they are both about scots in historical scotland . yet , this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that `` braveheart '' is a better film than `` rob roy '' . i like `` braveheart '' a lot , but the idea of comparing it to `` rob roy '' is a little insulting to me . to put quite simply , i love `` braveheart '' , but it is a pale shadow to how much i love `` rob roy '' . here are my particular reasons ... - '' rob roy '' is about real people . let 's face it , the william wallace in `` braveheart '' is not a real person . he 's a legend , a martyr , a larger than life figurehead . because of this depiction , he is also a perfect person , never doing wrong , and basically showing his scot countrymen to the promised land . when he finally does fail , it is not to his fault . like jesus , he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most . he even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much . the depiction of wallace is very well done and effective . but it really does n't inspire or intrigue me . i find human ambiguity far more facinating than human perfection . that is why `` the last temptation of christ '' is a better film than `` king of kings '' , and that is also one of the reasons why i think `` rob roy '' is better than `` braveheart '' . rob roy may be heroic and brave , but he is far from perfect . he makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones . now sure , not bearing false claim against the duke of argyll was an act of nobility and courage , but it was also an act of egoism and self centeredness . let us not forget that the kinfolk that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act . but rob did the best he could , and that was all you could ask of him . rob 's wife mary , is also a normal , ambigious person . let us start though , with how she looks in this film . sure , she 's beautiful , but she does n't wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show . compare this with the two loves ( or one , depending on your point of view ) of william wallace in `` braveheart '' . now these two ladies are hot , but hardly indicitive of how women looked at the time ( especially the lay persons ) . maybe not a fair comparison , but just another example of how rob roy 's attempts for accuracy are far more effective . throughout `` rob roy '' , mary has to live with her vicious rape by the dastardly carrion , cunningham . she feels compelled to tell rob of her struggle , but does n't because she knows that rob must seek revenge for her rape . such revenge would surely mean the death of rob , and mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice . the villains in `` rob roy '' are equally as compelling . although the enemies in `` braveheart '' are well written , they are hardly original . robert the bruce , a man both brave and cowardly , is plagued by moral decisions that are all to familar in the fictional realm . should he take his claim as the king of scotland , or should he betray wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name ? bruce is the most ambigious character in `` braveheart '' , but from brutus in `` julius ceasar '' to fredo in `` the godfather part ii '' , these types of characters are hardly original . longshanks , although a compelling villain in his own right , is very one dimensional . he is the epidemy of evil , and his tyrant ways stand in direct contrast to wallace 's heroism . `` rob roy '' has three villains that are wonderful in their chicanery . first of all , let 's start with marquis of montrose . he is a man who is so obsessed with his self image , that he 's willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it . `` see to it that i am not mocked '' are his favorite words to his `` factor '' . he is a man obsessed with power , upset that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of argyll can be considered of greater providency then him . he is shamefully self obsessed and insecure . he is an evil aristocrat , but in ways that make him unique . cunningham and callarn are the conspirators in `` rob roy '' , and are also roy 's direct assailants . callarn is so cunning in his cowardace that he is almost comical . he will do anything to maintain the good will of the marquis , which includes backstabbing and trickery . cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the marquis . he needs a father , little does he know that the marquis is his real father . therefore , when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from callarn , he grabs it without even questioning it . he is very much like the evil of modern man , so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others . many have criticized tim roth 's performance in this film as overacting . hogwash i say . it is clear that cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film . in a world where a man and his stepson can go around shooting random people for amusement , is cunningham too much of an unbelievable character ? we live in a society where people seem to have decreased the value of human life . `` rob roy '' simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this decreased value has changed . it is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion . rob roy and mary give us hope that goodness will prevail , but snakes will always exist in our world . another character that i find fascinating is the duke of argyll . he is a true nobleman , and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis . he appreciates the bravery of rob roy and mary , and has a direct vexation for the marquis and his factor . he gives the world hope for the people of power . hopefully , people like the marquis are an exception and not the rule . - the final duel in `` rob roy '' is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in `` braveheart '' . one thing i get tired of is people telling me that `` braveheart '' is a better film because of the battle scenes . first of all , battle scenes are hardly original . from `` spartacus '' to `` gladiator '' , hollywood has had a long tradition of historical european battle scenes . `` braveheart '' has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film , but they suffer from one important problem . these battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom . now , do n't get me wrong , duels are hardly original either . in fact , there are probably 10 times as many films with duels as there are with battle scenes . but the context of the duel between cunningham and rob roy is a beauty to behold . it is one of the greatest scenes in film history . let me explain why ... first of all , the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly . cunningham is effette and dangerous , rob roy is strong and courageous . cunningham uses a fencing sword while rob uses a broadsword . cunningham fights with quick tricky movements , while roy 's fighting style is more obvious . the whole film , from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half , is leading up to this moment . it is powerful stuff , and it is clear that rob must exterminate this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world . when rob finally gets the upper hand ( literally and figuratively , ) it is one of the greatest moments in film history . rob wins because he has more to live for , and his honor is more powerful than 10 cunningham 's . the use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene . good prevailing against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get disemboweled just so he can yell `` freedom ! '' . but hey , maybe that 's just me . - `` rob roy '' is more realistic than `` braveheart '' i do n't know that people in the aristocracy or scotsmen talked like the people in `` rob roy '' , but i do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns . i feel that many people are bored by `` rob roy '' simply because they ca n't understand what the characters are saying . if this is the case , then read some shakesphere , or put on the close-captioning . `` rob roy '' is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90 's . many of the dialogue in this film is clever , but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it . by contrast , the dialogue in `` braveheart '' is hardly very interesting . of course , what do you expect when the main character is a scotsman played by an australian ? this is a legend , and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times . this film takes place several centuries before `` rob roy '' , and yet they talk like the people today . thus the reason that many people like it better . audiences today have become increasingly lazy , and they do n't want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex . therefore , as with many epic films , they expect to see the villians speak a recognizable english accent while the heroes speak in a vernacular not too far away from our american language . sure , it is clear that the wallace is scotish , but other than sounding like scotty from star trek and a couple of `` aye '' s for acknowledgement , the scots in this film fit into the hollywood tradition of how we believe scots should sound . so , do these descriptions prove that `` rob roy '' is a better film than `` braveheart '' ? hardly . but if it proves one thing , it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that `` braveheart '' is a better film than `` rob roy '' . to put simply , `` rob roy '' is a film that has themes that are very apropos in today 's world . `` braveheart '' is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic . you can make a decision on what you think is better ... grade - a score - 9
with the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast . nice starship cgi in places but their green screen needs some work . anyone heard of adobe after effects 7 , they should buy it get their keying better . stories are well thought out , plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context . but but the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode . im not homophobic but i cant help that i do n't find men kissing entertaining ( dont mind women ) . anyway ... for a fan series this is good stuff . with minor improvement in their green screen , brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning . anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed tng and ds9 .
prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films , and there 's a good reason for that because it 's not one of the best ... but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer , this is certainly among the best of the lesser known/smaller films . the film does have some connection to blockbusters ; for a start it 's an early directorial effort for renny harlin ; the capable director behind a number of action films including die hard 2 , cliffhanger and deep blue sea ; and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo mortensen . the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting . we focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years . this was the prison where a man named charles forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison 's governor . naturally , the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace ; and when the old execution room is reopened , the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance . the film is not exactly the shawshank redemption , but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror , the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base . this is a good job too because other than the basic premise , the film does n't really have a 'plot ' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting . the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it 's never over the top , which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered , being released in a decade of excess . the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative , however , and provide some major highlights . as the film goes on , we start to delve more into the back-story of the vengeful convict 's ghost and while it 's fairly interesting , some things about it do n't make sense and it drags the film down a little . still , everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall i have to say that prison is a film well worth tracking down .
i suppose the ultimate curse of attending the toronto film festival is your release date time table get messed up . quite frankly , i 'm just happy fido got picked up for us distribution . in any case ... ever seen shaun of the dead ? good . how about lassie ? able to reconcile the two ? well , if you can your name might be andrew currie , canadian helmer of the first ever family themed zombie comedy , or zomedy . ( seriously , that 's what the press book in toronto called it . ) though not as violent , dry , or british as shaun of the dead , fido remains true to its roots : a devotion to old 50s black and white television including both lassie and the infamous sci-fi pulp that was being pumped out during the period . fido 's talented headliners ( carrie anne moss , billy connelly , dylan baker , and tim blake nelson ) stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script . the film explores all the implications of its premise : a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident . what would you use your new undead servant for ? a butler ? manual labor ? a pet ? unspeakable acts ? fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way , with much thanks to the work of connelly ( as one of said zombies ) and young tv actor k'sun ray , who seems at times to be a better young elijah wood than the young elijah wood was . if you 're expecting another shaun of the dead , do n't waste your time . there 's not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and you 'll just leave the theater bitter and depressed . but if you 're willing to take a look at what happens to shaun of the dead when it jumps across the lake , you 're in for a treat . think of fido as the sensitive , more often beaten up little brother to shaun of the dead 's rebellious loser , and you 're starting to get the drift . if you like ( or at least tolerate ) zombies , small children , and loads of deadpan satire , fido 's the film for you . if that 's not the case .... well , you know the drill . just hit 'em square between the eyes .
kabei : our mother ( 2008 ) is a poetic and sublime beauty from japan . a real weeper ! i had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from netflix . am i glad i did ! in many ways this film reminded me of the old style of japanese classic film-making from the 1940 's and 1950 's that i 've come to love so much , such as seen in yasujiro ozu pictures -- the title credits even begin in the same way , with the japanese letters ( characters ) in red against neutral color burlap material . i immediately thought : this director loves ozu . the same style was used too : mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes . even a couple of `` pillow shots '' , as roger ebert calls them . the strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another . the story follows the lives of a japanese family before , and during , and after , world war two . the mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father ( a university professor ) is arrested for anti-war sympathies . he 's never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease . meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls . he begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls . but war starts and he 's drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell . will they ever express their love for one another ? will he ever return from the war ? there is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress , sayuri yoshinaga . she 's almost a madonna type , she 's so beautiful ! big soulful eyes and flawless skin . the actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well : his name is tadanobu asano . what a sensitive performance . there is no macho in him at all ; he 's gentle and kind . i 'd certainly love to see both of these two in other movies . i think i 'll check to see what 's available for them . the two little child actresses are wonderful too . the film is just released on ntsc dvd for american audiences , with very easy to read english subtitles . i gave it a 10 out of 10 on the imdb . i cried almost as much as with the japanese film classic twenty-four eyes ( 1954 ) . do n't miss this film !
i find this movie the best movie i have ever seen , because it reflects the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war . the movie is impressive , not least because it actually happened . it reminds me of the story of anne frank .
omigosh , this is seriously the scariest movie i have ever , ever seen . to say that i love horror movies would be an understatement , and i have seen heaps ( considering the limited availability in new zealand , that 's quite a lot ) , but never before have i had to sleep with the light on ... until i saw the grudge . some may say that it is a rip off of the ring ( both based on japanese horror movies ) , both similar ( yet different ) story lines , but the grudge holds its own as a terrifying movie - seeing at at the cinema , i even screamed at a certain point in the movie . the acting is great , particularly from the supporting characters - kadee strickland is fantastic and steals the show , she is such an enthusiastic person . jason behr is a real hottie , and william mapother looks like he is having fun . however , while i am normally a fan of clea duvall 's , she does n't really seem into this movie . of the supporting characters , hers probably got the most depth and back story , but she does n't seem like she is all there . as for sarah michelle gellar , well , she stays about the same through all her films and roles does n't she ? the ghosts were genuinely scary , the music and sound effects were chilling ( particularly the noise being made when kadee strickland 's character answered the phone in her apartment ) , the ending was cool too . super highly recommended . 9/10
not a bad word to say about this film really . i was n't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly . i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people ca n't see past the fact that it was banned in some territories , mine being one of them . the film delivers in the shock , gore and atmosphere department . the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering apparatus . it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best composers in the business . the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard , if a little wooden in some spots , and the effects are very real and gritty . all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book . i 've noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious flack having the famous killer 's p.o.v shot . and i ask : what 's wrong with that ? ? ? it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer 's identity a secret . the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist ( killer revealed ) is not handled with more care , i mean it just happens kind of quickly , though the great performances make it just about credible . aside from that pranks is a great movie ( though i prefer the original title ) and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap . its more than that , but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the haze of early 80s slasher . what a shame .... its a really good movie people ! believe me !
... and i love it . lots of special effects , and for a movie that 's not made on mega budget , this movie really does great job of creating a fantasy masterpiece . i 'm one of the guys who did n't understand the story at all , but this was still a great flick to watch . it 's definitely up there in standards surpassing bored of the rings , and on par with movies like harry potter . which is saying a lot for a movie again , made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits . one thing i really love about this movie is that it so stretches the envelope of adventure movie to come out of hong kong . the topic is exotic and original . production quality is unlike anything seen coming out of hk for fantasy action movie , and acting is great . one of the best movies to come out of hong kong , this is the infernal affairs of hong kong fantasy movie , and i hope they 'll continue working in this area , until they surpass hollywood adventure movies . just fantastic .
i was not only an extra in this movie , i got to see it in boston to a sold out cinema . over a thousand boston red sox / farrelly fans jammed themselves into a movie theater near boston common to watch a comedy .... about them .... red sox fanatics ! drew barrymore and jimmy fallon star is this cute comedy about love and lust . the love is between the two young lovers . the lust is for the red sox winning the world series . although fallon is not a great actor , he is the best actor for the role . he is funny enough and gets the most laughs . barrymore on the other hand is the same old barrymore . at times , i felt supporting actress ione skye would have been a better actor for the role . all in all , all boston red sox fans will love this movie . for the rest of the world , this is just a funny movie .
there are people claiming this is another `` bad language '' ultra violence mexican movie . they are right , but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become . the awful truth hurts , or bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal . one of the most important things of `` cero y van cuatro '' is the open invitation to profound reflexion over our current identity . is that what we all are ? is that all that we want to be ? i am abroad and i realized how spoiled is the mexican society when the tlahuac incident came to light . i still can not understand viewers witnessing a mass broadcasted murder . i nearly puked when i saw some of the images . it was not irak or rwanda , just a tiny village near mexico city when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government . the recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply . the other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption , dishonesty , betrayal and violence , but i consider `` tamales de chivo '' the best one . the movie is deeper than some `` cabrón '' and `` pendejo '' screams . those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people . with a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish . just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in our country . moreover , honesty is only rewarded miraculously .
this was my favourite film as a child , and i have been in the stage production a few times so it will always remain my favourite muscical and i doubt anybody could ever re-make the story of oliver twist on screen , any better than this one did . my all-time favourite `` bad guy '' has to be oliver reed as bill sikes . not only did he scare the life out of my when i watched it as a 6 year old , but now as a woman i can empathize more with nancys character , the bar maid/prostitute who helps oliver get the life he deserves . jack wilde as the artful dodger , was fantastic , and i do n't think anybody could ever out-do him , as the street-pocket picker , and best friend of fagin . the music is fantastic , especially fagin 's numbers , i 'm also quite thankful they did n't give bill sikes a musical number , it would n't of worked with him being such a sinister character . i think carol reed did an excellent job of nancy 's sticky ending , keeping it a g rated movie by disguising her beating , but giving enough away to show the violence of bill towards her . this movie is both charming , and charismatic as a musical sing-along , as well as being a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life .
it appears even the director does n't like this film , but for me i think he 's being a bit harsh on himself . sure it 's not perfect , but there are some atmospheric shots , and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout . it 's shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as well . if you like horror films shot in england , give it a go . i have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film 'the devil 's chair ' which looks quite amazing . there are n't enough english horror films for me , so any that come along deserve our attention , and this one is n't as bad as you may think
melissa joan hart shines ! this show is amazing ! ! there is no match . except for maybe melissa in clarissa explains it all . she was marvelous in that , too . this is so much better than buffy , the vampire slayer . this show is wonderful !
this is a film that the mainstream market will probably never be able to access as it does n't exactly give the viewer easy watching . the story about troubled spike and his friend heaton is not exactly a friday night film yet it has its own unique edge and i found that it was entertaining . there are moments of brilliance given that the film was shot on such a low budget , such as when spike inhales the aerosol . however i did not really understand the relationship between spike and heaton and to be honest it made me spend most of the film trying to work it out . and also i did not like the fact that most of the film is spent with the two friends talking and not really much `` action '' . it is a small film that is complex to watch and that is what makes it appealing .
genre : dinosaur , animation , new york , time travel , circus. ? main characters : rex the tyrannosaurus rex , elsa the pterodactyl , dweeb the parasarolophus , ooo the triceratops , a boy called louis , a girl called cecilia and captain new-eyes . ? actors : john goodman ( rex ) , yeardley smith ( cecilia ) , martin short ( stubbs the clown ) , felicity kendal ( elsa ) etc. ? what happens : four dinosaurs ( see above ) are fed some `` brain grain cereal '' and are now cuddly , friendly dinosaurs who are going to be nice to children . they go into new york , with big plans my thoughts : this is a cute animated film . the animation of the dinosaurs when they go cuddly and friendly is a bit floppy and not-so-good , but they look pleasant all the same that way . i like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly , they are nice , friendly and good . i like ( almost ) all the characters featured , especially elsa and cecilia , but of course i like the others as well . overall , i like this film a lot ! : - ) recommended to : people who like good children 's animated films , people who like dinosaurs , john goodman and people who think that circuses are n't always what they seem enjoy ! : - )
james dickey is a wonderfully descriptive author . when one reads `` deliverance '' , one is instantly transported into the lush backwoods of the deep south . when one watches john boorman 's film version of the book , one realizes just how accurately he captures the essence of the book . the camera is as descriptive as the narration . the characters are fully realized , and the portrayals are fantastic . i first saw this movie in 1992 , after my freshman year of college . i was in a phase where i was watching movies that were all released within a couple of years of my birth in 1973 . among them were `` patton '' , `` papillon '' , and `` all the president 's men '' ; fine films , all of them . this one was easily the class of the group . that says a lot .
this story was never among my favourites in christie 's works so i was pleasantly surprised to quite enjoy this adaptation . the mouse motif was effective if a little overdone , the bones of the story are there although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past ' subplot . the students were all pretty much as i imagined them although its a pity they were n't a more cosmopolitan bunch - perhaps the revised thirties setting did n't allow for that ! i thought some very daring risks were taken with the filming ; perhaps its because i 've not long re-read the book but it seemed pretty obvious to me who the murderer was from their appearance in some reveal shots quite early on . humour was much more prevalent in these early poirots . sometimes it works but i found a lot of it rather heavy handed in this episode ( though i did smile at the 'lemon sole ' throwaway line ) . altogether though , a solid entry in the series though not one of the best .
this is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word . it tells a tail that here in greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is . sure it has some extremes .. but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art.it is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them . the film has a deeper understanding of greek ways of life , stereotypes , and social structure . unlike most greek films that have a certain fast-food-mainstream audience , this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings . i am not a big fan of traditional music either but i would n't like to hear anything else when it was played during the film . if someone told me to say something against this film i 'd define the following , sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut . i guess the editing had to cut it up to fit the 2hours and a bit for the theatres .. anyway i could write more and more to express my thought over this but i guess u have to see it and discuss it with a friend . a must see
as a kid i remember being nine or ten and loving this movie . it was the all round bollywood action/comedy movie . it is a imitation of bad boys obviously ! the whole swapping identities but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colourful villains who dance and sing ! the action scenes in the film are n't revolutionary but still amazing scenes . the film is genuinely very funny and was the great comeback amitabh bachan needed . govinda is a gem like always and this is probably his best work to date , he shines as the side kick nd delivers the best comedy scenes available in indian cinema . the songs .... the songs are both funny and catchy .............. proving laughs when you least expect it ... amitabh bachan surprisingly is very funny and will make you laugh as 'bade miah ' .... his accent ... body language ..... brilliant ... 'assi chutki naab re daal ' is the best song .............. hilarious .
if you love cult 70 's sci-fi the way i do , or if you like movies such as `` repo man '' or `` buckaroo bonzai '' than you 're going to love this one . it 's a stream of consciousness 70 's sci-fi spectacular , including a 22nd century junkyard and the earth a million years from now . this movie is pure 70 's . put on steve miller 's `` fly like an eagle '' or pink floyd 's `` dark side of the moon '' and you 're ready to go !
first a quick 'shut up ! ' to those saying this movie stinks . you ca n't go to every movie expecting 'citizen kane ' . this was actually a fun movie . jason lee is good in everything he does . the only flaw in this movie is , i do n't think there was enough chemestry between lee and julia stiles . they should have dwelled more on that . other than that , the movie is good fun . selma blair needs to eat something . she 's worrying me . but she still looks beautiful . so yes , i recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun . go see . rating : * * 1/2 out of * * * *
....... playing kaddiddlehopper , col san fernando , etc . the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream . i love watching him interact w/ amanda blake , or don knotts or whomever -- he clearly was having a ball and i think he made it easier on his guests as well -- so long as they knew ahead of time it was n't a disciplined , 19 take kind of production . relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there . he reminds me of guys like milton berle , benny hill , maybe jerry lewis some too . great timing , ancient gags that kept audiences in stitches for decades , sheer enjoyment about what he was doing . his sad little clown he played was good too -- but in a touching manner . personally i think he 's great , having just bought a two dvd set of his shows from '61 or so , it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me . i can remember seeing him on tv at the end of his run when he was winding up the series in 1971 or so . check this out if you are a fan or curious . he was a riot .
i absolutely love this game to death . ever since i was 9 years old ( i am now 15 ) . it has great graphics , characters , magic , weapons , additions , and do n't forget the ultimately awesome dragoon forms ! i am still waiting for a remake , prequel , or a sequel to this spectacular video game . you play as dart , a young swordsman who has the potential to be quite the hero . on this adventure you encounter wondrous creatures and boss fights . you also encounter some friends on the way who have their own special element . such as fire , darkness , water/ice , thunder/lightning , earth , light , and wind . there are also items known as dragoon spirits , which allow you to transform into magical creatures of legend . dragons , wizards , creatures called winglies and evil creatures you 'll have to face on this adventure of action-packed thrills and excitement . one of my all time favorite games , the legend of dragoon !
the penultimate episode of star trek 's third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season . essentially , spock , mccoy and kirk beam down to sarpeidon to find the planet 's population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and mr. atoz , the librarian . all 3 trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of sarpeidon 's past . spock gives a convincing performance as an ice age vulcan who falls in love for zarabeth while kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel -- see the 'city on the edge of forever ' -- when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to sarpeidon 's present . in the end , all 3 trek characters are saved mere minutes before the beta niobe star around sarpeidon goes supernova . the enterprise warps away just as the star explodes . ironically , as william shatner notes in his book `` star trek memories , '' this show was the source of some dispute since leonard nimoy noticed that no reason was given in lisette 's script for the reason why spock was behaving in such an emotional way . nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show 's executive producer , fred freiberger , that vulcans were n't supposed to fall in love . ( p.272 ) however , freiberger reasoned , the ice age setting allowed spock to experience emotions since this was a time when vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state . this was a great example of improvisation on freiberger 's part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode . while shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in `` plato 's stepchildren , '' play music with hippies in `` the way to eden '' or sometimes display emotion , the script here was more believable . spock 's acting here was excellent as freiberger candidly admitted to shatner . ( p.272 ) the only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both spock and mccoy travelled thousands of years back in time , mccoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state , not just spock . but this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows , the brilliant spock/mccoy performance and the originality of this script . who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet 's fate by travelling into their past ? this is certainly what we came to expect from the best of 'classic trek ' -- a genuinely inspired story . shatner , in 'memories ' , named some of his best `` unusual and high quality shows '' of season 3 as the enterprise incident , day of the dove , is there in truth no beauty , the tholian web , and the children shall lead and the paradise syndrome . ( p.273 ) while my personal opinion is that 'and the children shall lead ' is a very poor episode while 'is there in truth no beauty ' is problematic , `` all our yesterdays '' certainly belongs on the list of top season three star trek tos films . i give a 9 out of 10 for 'all our yesterdays . '
great movie when i saw it . have to say one of my favorite movies of all time . i saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the dvd . as i got older and saw it again i realized that the movie is average . compared to movies that are known ad good comedys , this is nothing . i mean rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great . also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking . it 's like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch . i like the movie overall so i give it a ... still a good 7/10 for me .
`` welcome to collingwood '' offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory . watching this comedy directed by the brothers anthony and joe russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past , but since we missed the opening credits , we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of , was the 1958 italian film `` big deal on madonna street '' , directed by mario monicelli . the russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film . anything with william h. macy , luis guzman , sam rockwell , patricia clarkson , the late michael jeter , in it , ca n't be bad . since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine . the film presents us a group of inane would-be safe crackers from hell . no one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake . whatever could go wrong , and more , is what they succeed in doing . george clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi , only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of cossimo 's funeral . the best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax , and let all these small time crooks do their thing . let their funny lines make you laugh , as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end !
big splashy film of the broadway music . nathan ( frank sinatra ) loves to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games . blonde loving adelaide ( vivian blaine ) wants to marry him if he gives up craps . he decides on one last game when sky masterson ( marlon brando ! ) , who bets big , is in town . he bets sky that he ca n't get mission worker sarah brown ( jean simmons ) to go with him to havana . that may sound like a strange plot summary but so is the movie ! this is a real mixed bag -- there 's some wonderful stuff here . the songs are all good and the dancing is incredible . the real show stopper is at the crap game at the end . also brando is really quite good here -- it might seem strange to think of him singing and dancing but he pulls it off . i have to admit seeing big , bulky brando pulling off some difficult dance moves was a lot of fun ! also sinatra is pretty good and blaine is just wonderful as his long-suffering girlfriend . her song and dance numbers are definite highlights here . now for the bad parts -- jean simmons is a wonderful actress but she 's stuck with a drab colorless role and ca n't do much with it . the movie is far too long at 150 minutes -- the scenes between brando and simmons really drag and should have been shortened . also most of the characters speak in very precise english -- contractions are never used . maybe it 's trying to be amusing coming out of the mouths of gangsters but i found it jarring and it kept throwing me out of the movie . it 's worth catching for the songs and dances but the over length of it does get to you after a while . i give it a 7 .
george and kim are traveling with their young son miles to a remote cabin in upstate new york when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch.but what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey , where myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating spirit , half animal and half man wendigo , haunts a small town ... '' wendigo '' by larry fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot 's into a somber family drama.the acting is great , the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling moments.the subtle glimpses of wendigo are handled effectively and it 's never clear what is real and what is imagined , or even if the story is taking place entirely in miles ' head.overall , '' wendigo '' is my first contact with larry fessenden 's work and surely wo n't be the last.give this film a chance , if you do n't mind watching something unconventional.8 out of 10 .
joan crawford had just begun her `` working girl makes good '' phase with the dynamic `` paid '' ( 1930 ) . she had never attempted a role like that before and critics were impressed . so while other actresses were wondering why their careers were foundering ( because they were clinging to characters that had been the `` in '' thing a few years before but were now becoming passe ) joan was listening to the public and securing her longevity as an actress . the depression was here and jazz age babies who survived on an endless round of parties were frowned upon . of course , if you became rich through immoral means but suffered for it - that was alright . this film starts out with a spectacular house boat party . bonnie jordan ( joan crawford ) is the most popular girl there - especially when she suggests that everyone go swimming in their underwear ! ! ! however , when bonnie 's father has a heart attack , because of loses on the stock market , both bonnie and her brother , rodney ( william bakewell ) realise who their real friends are . after bob townsend ( lester vail - a poor man 's johnny mack brown ) offers to do the `` right thing '' and marry her - they had just spent a night together when bonnie declared ( with abandon ) that she wants love on approval - she starts to show some character by deciding to get a job . she finds a job at a newspaper and quickly impresses by her will to do well . her working buddy is bert scranton ( cliff edwards ) and together they are given an assignment to write about the inside activities of the mob . rodney also surprises her with the news that he also has a job . she is thrilled for him but soon realises it is bootlegging and he is mixed up with cold blooded killer , jake luva ( clark gable ) . rodney witnesses a mass shooting and goes to pieces , `` spilling the beans '' to the first person he sees drinking at the bar - which happens to be bert . he is then forced to kill bert and after- wards he goes into hiding . the paper pulls out all stops in an effort to find bert 's killer and sends bonnie undercover as a dancer in one of jake 's clubs . ( joan does a very lively dance to `` accordian joe '' - much to sylvie 's disgust ) . the film ends with a gun battle and as rodney lies dying , bonnie tearfully phones in her story . this is a super film with crawford and gable giving it their all . natalie moorehead , who as sylvie shared a famous `` cigarette scene '' with gable early in the film , was a stylish `` other woman '' who had her vogue in the early thirties . william bakewell had a huge career ( he had started as a teenager in a douglas fairbanks film in the mid 20s ) . a lot of his roles though were weak , spineless characters . in this film he played the weak brother and was completely over-shadowed by joan crawford and the dynamic newcomer clark gable - maybe that was why he never became a star . highly recommended .
it has been said that deanna durbin invented teenagery . this first film was one of the best . the humorous story presented a delightful 14 year old deanna , a little beauty with a gorgeous voice , as the `` miss fixit '' in a family split by divorce . for plot summary , see other imdb entries , but quickly deanna and her two older sisters plan to go to america from switzerland to prevent their father from remarrying . with an excellent supporting cast especially barbara read and nan grey as the sisters , good direction and editing , the film succeeds in captivating one even on subsequent viewings . of deanna 's three songs , only `` il bacio '' is from the classical repertoire , but when she sings it in that police station scene , the film 's place in history is assured . at least it was for this viewer who at the age of 15 was smitten for life with both deanna and classical music . one of the many nice touches that occur throughout three smart girls is the brief glimpse of the drunk stretching his neck for a final glimpse of deanna as the cops hustle him by ! one unfortunate result of the success of this film was that subsequent writers for durbin vehicles became locked into the `` miss fixit '' theme , which quickly became stale . deanna herself never did . her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma , which she certainly had . it seems to me that , like many another film personality , she substituted `` naturalness '' for the histrionic ability that she lacked . the ploy worked well for 21 feature films .
this movie captures the absurd essence of an overbearing american patriot actor -- one that believes his work ( and politics ) are as crucial to the american people as the opinions of the president himself . alan bates captures this mindset perfectly as michael baytes , and i will immortally remember bates as this character . this is a movie for canadians and americans alike . it is a valuable piece of cinema , that which is able to take its audience through the magic of making a film and reveal just how easy it is for the producer and director to lose complete control to the will of the actors and innumerable outside forces . wonderfully , `` hollywood north '' does not suffer from the subject that it portrays : peter o'brian directs with precision and complete control , and commands both the serious 'behind-the-scenes ' portion of the movie , and the movie-within-the-movie , `` flight to bogota '' with clarity and insight . if you are at all interested in the wit and strength of canadian cinema , `` hollywood north '' is a great place to start .
almost the entire film takes place in a public bathhouse in china . there are no fancy sets , explosion or glamorous people -- only fine writing , acting and direction ( hollywood , take note ! ) . an estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying . he is surprised to see that dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual . in fact , he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop ! dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and does n't really see the value of the old bathhouse . how their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable . i was happy to see that not every chinese movie is an action picture ( such as those starring jet li or crouching tiger , hidden dragon ) , as i do n't particularly care for these frenetic films . the shower as well as springtime in a small town are two wonderful examples of good chinese films about people !
leonard maltin must 've been watching some other movie . ( though i find his guide to be quite a valuable resource , please disregard his comments on this one . ) he states `` starts off well then fizzles '' when it 's really the reverse - `` starts off tepid then catches fire '' . the plot is about as simple as it gets . happy mom , happy dad and happy son take a vacation at an isolated beach , dad incapacitated in accident , mom runs off to get help , meets up with dangerous escaped convict . mom tries to trick convict into helping while dad waits and hangs on for dear life . good white-knuckler given an electric jolt by ralph meeker , appearing suddenly ( the director , john sturges , films it in a clever way that will make you gasp ) around halfway through as the cunning , desperate criminal . meeker is an unusually flippant , reckless actor ( at least here and in the classic `` kiss me deadly '' ) and he happily snatches the keys to the film 's narrative and speeds off with the top down . his character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying `` pretty neat , huh ? '' when he 's especially pleased with his misdeeds . there is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage , barbara stanwyck , `` do n't go away '' . she fires back `` where would i go ? '' ( they 're in the middle of nowhere ) and he realizes sitcom-ishly `` yeah , that 's right '' . the friction between them is a hoot . there are flaws , somewhat ridiculous ones . there 's one scene where the police , who have been chasing after meeker for some time , stop stanwyck 's car and to evade detection meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would , and pretends to be asleep as she 's being questioned . a . he looks conspicuously un-masculine in this pose and b. i think it 's safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion . still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion .
the true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether or not the characters grow from their experiences and emerge from the experience altered in some significant way ( note that this change need not be positive or beneficial ) at the end . by that measure , enchanted april is a resounding success . as a film in general , it succeeds quite well-excellent ensemble cast , well-developed characters you come to care about , wonderful script and beautiful sets and locations . in short the film is , well , enchanting . although all the performances are first-rate , three must be mentioned-josie lawrence , jim broadbent and joan plowright . it says something when miranda richardson does her usual fine work and yet is overshadowed by so many others in the cast . most highly recommended , particularly if you are a romantic at heart . further deponent saith not .
in iran , the islamic revolution has shaped all parts of life , including everyday things . but people still go on living their lives , generally just doing the things you 'd expect , like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it 's in the running to qualify for the world cup . except women are n't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game . a frequently funny little film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium . the absurdity of the situation , the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team ( nothing subversive there ) , and little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a fine comment on humanity versus the ideology . amateurish acting , good script and dialogue , a really enjoyable film . bend it like beckham , sort of - a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people .
this film does not fail to engage and move , even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern over-produced sound and computer enhanced techniques . the experience of the movie goer in 1922 who could only see this in a cinema with others on their big screen must have been truly profound and a thoroughly satisfying experience . one has to ask could a film maker today make a two hour silent movie and make it interesting and achieve the same structure tempo and balance as this movie has . silent film making was pure art , it had to hold the attention through its structure , direction and acting - there was no padding out with more words or computer generated distractions . a poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwatchable . this film needs to be put into context for those who might be disconcerted with the mention of christian themes . this is not a 'christiany ' film , it is not selling anything . these themes along with reference to current moral standards often appear in this era - also church going on sundays was a national past time , christianity was a given in most households thus the film is only depicting normal life as it was then . the themes would have rung true and deep at the time . it is most odd given the strong support to good christian thinking of this particular movie ( and it is not preaching religion to anyone , only highlighting the difference between hypocrites and the honest ) that in 1922 a pastor in an open debate with a representative from the film industry with a large crowd denounced pickford as an example of immorality , along with some other individuals he named . ny times 1922 . maybe they should have watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and , learned some lessons . the pastor complained that since the film industry had started church attendance had dropped 500,000 . the film representative in the debate however made the following observations ; that saloon attendance had also dropped , that there were far more pastors in prison than actors ( fact ) and that selecting a few examples from among the many was not representative of the whole . thus there was an ongoing battle between church and the film industry during the early days of film . this is a wonderful film about being honest and true to family friends and to be willing to make sacrifices . mary pickford , naive , honest , feisty , full of happiness and joy , faithful , humorous and silently sacrificing - though poor and uneducated she represented the perfect character . this however is not thrust down our throat but revealed bit by bit through the film . this is reminiscent of some modern chinese films where characters are slowly , languidly revealed over the course of a film and it is this tempo that creates a stronger connection with the character . it has a smooth even tempo for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section . the last 30 minutes are great film making and it has to be appreciated it was achieved without the benefit of sound , running dialog - it was achieved through deft acting and great directing . it is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film you have n't hear a word spoken , but it feels like you have heard everything . the supporting cast put in great performances especially gloria hope , jean hersholt and lloyd hughes . the final few minutes are typical pickford understated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow , a near perfect balance and ending . this is a special type of touching humor that should not be underestimated . chaplin used this device often and copied some of from pickford . another special observation to be made about silent films and especially pickford films is that the star often has to hold the camera for much of the movie without the audience becoming jaded or bored , with the actors over-exposure . that pickford is usually thoroughly the center of attention through most of her movies but the people still could n't get enough of her is a testament to her fine acting ability .
this is the magnum opus from the swedish king of crap , mats-helge olsson . seldom has a movie of this magnitude been made in sweden and it truly stands out as one of the most amazing achievements in swedish film to date . who pays for these things ? the russian nuclear scientist markov wants to defect to sweden . but his plans are ruined by the russian military who kidnap him and tell him that he has arrived in sweden . this trickery is their way of seeing to that markov continues his work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the energy supply for the whole planet . the cia however is bent on getting markov to the west and send their ninja to liberate him . the practice of having swedish actors speaking english is something that mats-helge has perfected in his later works . the cheap b-movie feeling this creates is probably unmatched for performance . but besides this ? well the action is standard direct-to-video style . machine guns firing huge clouds of smoke . thousands of russians dying . people running around in black ninja suits , trying to hide in the snow . what really stands out though is the insanely poor way the fighting scenes are choreographed . when they say `` ninja '' in the title i expect martial arts , i expect close combat . but there are maybe two or three scenes of actual martial arts in this movie . and they are hilarious . it 's so bad i lack the words to describe it . if the ninjas moved any slower their hearts would stop . and of course the whole movie ends in a bang that indicates a special-effects budget consisting of four food-stamps and a mcdonald 's voucher . so what 's the verdict ? instant classic of course . never before has a movie been made that is so obviously meant to be consumed along with huge amounts of alcohol . it 's the ultimate party movie . insert into video and laugh . one just has to realize that movies like these are not made any more . this is film history . therefore the rating is 8/10 for entertainment , 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accents .
i have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me . most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up , show off sexy models , and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window . with that said , the bourne series has been fantastic . doug liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style , showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly . this is not the sci-fi absurdity that was bond ( before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less ) . there was a lot to worry for when the bourne supremacy came out . with director paul greengrass taking over , what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair . the stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it . greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment , the bourne ultimatum . in what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy , the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised . once again , bourne is brought into the minds of the cia by false pretenses . someone has leaked information about the treadstone upgrade called blackbriar and once bourne is located trying to converse with the newswriter who broke the story , he is assumed to be the mole . only pamela landy , she who was on the case to find him in supremacy , knows that he ca n't be the one . bourne 's motive has always been to stay clear of the government and live his life in peace . it has been the cia who keeps bringing him back into the open to wreak havoc on them . what ends up transpiring is that bourne wants to know the source as well to finally find out the truth of who he is and what made him into a killer . the film , then , becomes a chase against time and each other to find the source and see if the government can close the breach and tie off all loose ends , or if bourne can get his revenge on those who took his life from him . in what is probably the simplest storyline of the series , with only one chase lasting the entirety of the story , it has possibly the biggest cast of characters and turning over of loyalties to expose the corruption that has been behind the full story progression . this is not a detriment at all , however , as it allows for more fights and car chases that work in full context to the plot . admission to this film is worth it for the apartment fight , between bourne and the cia 's second asset , alone . the chase jumping through windows in madrid is cool on its own , but when they finally meet up , we get a ten minute or so fight that is as invigorating to watch as any scene you 'll see . also , rather than using a massive car chase as a climatic set piece like in the first two films , we instead get around three small scale road races , just as intense , but staggered enough to never bog the action down into monotony . after five years of waiting , we also find out the origin of our favorite operative with heart and feeling . by the end of the film we will find out what has been the cause of all the espionage and destruction that has taken place around him . no one could have done it better than matt damon . he has the physique and attitude to be believable in the action sequences , but also the range to pull off the moments of intelligence and cat and mouse correspondence with those against him . joan allen reprises her role with the same amount of dedication to her job , but also a bit more disenchantment for what is going on around her after how brian cox 's character , from the first two films , took matters into his own hands . needing a role in that mold , we are given a nice turn from david strathairn . like cox , he is working at the top of the food chain and answers to no one when making a decision . with as much trying to cover up any connections to his bosses of the blackbriar program as he is trying to do his duty to his country , you can never quite gauge what he will be capable of doing . even the little guys do a wonderful job , like paddy considine as the reporter who starts the leak at the center of everything , albert finney as a man from bourne 's past and possibly key to his origin , and edgar ramirez as one of the cia 's operatives sent to take bourne out . ramirez is a nice addition to the role that has been successfully played by clive owen ( identity ) , karl urban , and martin csokas ( supremacy ) . he does n't talk much , if at all , but he has the look and robotic efficiency down pat and hopefully will get more roles to show what he can do post a nice turn in domino . in the end , one has to applaud paul greengrass for continuing to exceed expectations and bring this series to a conclusion that builds on the success of its predecessors rather than destroy them . his skill at the close-up hand-held look is astonishing and has the same kinetic energy as tony scott , but without quite the seizure-inducing cuts . rather than feel like over- production , his use of hand-held enhances the environment and puts you directly into the action . let 's also credit cinematographer oliver wood , who shot all three bourne films . he was able to work with both directors and work his style into a nice harmony with them .
a hot-headed cop accidentally kills a murder suspect and then covers up the crime , but must deal with a guilty conscience while he tries to solve a murder case . andrews and tierney are reunited with director preminger in a film noir that is as effective as `` laura , '' their earlier collaboration . andrews is perfectly cast as the earnest cop , a good guy caught up in unfortunate circumstances . the acting is fine all around , including malden as a tough police captain and tully as tierney 's protective father . the screenplay by hecht , a great and prolific screenwriter , is taut and suspenseful , and preminger creates a great atmosphere .
due to the invention of a `` the domestication collar '' , flesh-eating zombies are brought under control , and become productive members of society ; however , they perform menial tasks . the servile dead attend to those living in fenced us 1950s-styled small towns , while untamed zombies roam around in `` the wild zone '' . in the town of `` willard '' , pre-teen k'sun ray ( as timmy robinson ) lives with parents carrie-anne moss and dylan baker ( as helen and bill robinson ) . alas , the robinsons are the only family on their street who do not own a zombie ; their new neighbors , the bottoms , have six . so , to keep up , the robinsons obtain zombie billy connolly ( as fido ) . unfortunately , mr. connolly 's `` domestication collar '' is damaged by an old lady 's walker , and he eats her ; then , new and hungry zombies infest the town . meanwhile , young ray has grown attached to connolly ( the boy and his zombie are like tv 's `` timmy and lassie '' ) and , the robinson family find it difficult to cooperate with the controlling `` zomcom '' authorities . `` fido '' does n't go far enough into its own intriguing `` wild zone '' ; but , it is a colorful , stylish , and amusingly satirical addition to zombie film lore . ray and the cast perform well , individually ; with nubile zombie sonja bennett ( as tammy ) and owner tim blake nelson ( as theopolis ) the most memorable pair . director andrew currie and crew , including rob gray ( design ) , jan kiesser ( photography ) , don macdonald ( music ) , and james willcock ( design ) , deservedly won awards . * * * * * * * fido ( 2006 ) andrew currie ~ k'sun ray , carrie-anne moss , billy connolly , dylan baker
i really have to disagree with guy-yardley-rees who ( should he have watched the entire film ) would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery ( some of the best ever shot in skye ) and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole . this is not a big budget film . rather it is a film that has a strong community feel . i ca n't say how much 'standard ' films bore me - pushing out the same polished stuff again and again . seachd does n't seem to be about that at all . it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film . ok , so the acting is n't in the style a blockbuster . that 's because the actors are seemingly real people . i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and at times unusually beautiful . seachd really bears a second viewing , since there are many threads that become clearer second time around - that really do feed into the ending . overall , the combination of music and ( at times ) stunning visuals , plus a community approach to the acting and non-normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film . more of these please !
i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10 ! the final episode of the 10th season `` unending '' , where ( it would certainly appear that ) the asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed , unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion , left me in disbelief ! from the extremely rushed end of the series , it 's obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season . my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-dvd moves ! unless the asgard return in a future sg-1 movie ( with a very good explanation of the `` apparent '' extinction ) , i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean-up of loose-ends ! poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series .
hey guys , i have been looking every where to find these two movies and i ca n't find them anywhere in my local area . ( i am australian ) . could you please help me and tell me where i can buy it from . in general home ward bound 1 and 2 are the best movies i have ever seen and are good for people of all ages . it was my favourite movie wen i was 5 and it still is even now when i am a teenager . it is a great movie for the whole family . my entire family loves this movie except for my younger sister because i have watched it that many times that she is sick of it . i love this movie and i cant wait till i can buy it again on dvd . sally
if my expectations were n't exceeded , they were certainly met . `` nancy drew '' works both as a mystery and a comedy . it pays homage to the books it was based on and spoofs them at the same time . the movie starts with a close-up on a book shelf and an animated credit sequence resembling illustrations from the books . it then begins lampooning the books immediately . writer/director andrew fleming seems to realize the idea of a teenage girl regularly breaking up crime rings in a small town is ridiculous , so he does n't treat the idea religiously . he pokes fun at nancy drew 's ability to do anything , such as ace every class in school , know which baked treat is perfect for converting any enemy to her side , make a bird house with twelve flying buttresses , and even perform an emergency tracheotomy at a party . nancy 'd always be in perfect style , if she were living in the wholesome 1950 's instead of present day l.a. and she carries around a `` sleuth kit '' complete with fingerprinting dust , flashlight , compass , and magnifying glass . preposterous , of course , but i seem to remember the hardy boys ' access at any given moment to csi equipment being a little too convenient as well . and if the perky pipsqueak private eye is a little younger than her literary counterpart , it 's just more comedic exaggeration on the movie 's part . the mystery of the movie is handled more seriously . nancy and her lawyer father move from their small town to los angeles , where nancy digs into a cold case involving the murder of a hollywood movie star who lived in her new house decades ago . nancy searches for clues in some pretty practical ways , such as surfing websites like google and this one and watching old videotapes of the victim 's movies . when she does something more out of the ordinary , you have to admire the girl 's resourcefulness . emma roberts , an undeniably cute kid , plays the pint-sized amateur sleuth beautifully . she makes the too-perfect girl completely lovable , if not completely realistic . tate donovan is also great as the too-perfect girl 's father , carson drew . he 's an ideal father figure without being unrealistically perfect , and he shows reasonable concern for his daughter as she gets into danger . less likable is max thierot 's take on ned nickerson , nancy 's boyfriend . i much preferred george o'hanlon jr. 's portrayal in the 1970 's tv series starring pamela sue martin as nancy drew , in which ned was a gawky , awkward kid with a little crush on nancy . the character of corky ( josh flitty ) , a twelve-year old with a crush on nancy , is much less annoying than max thierot 's ned . amy bruckner and kay panabaker seem appropriately cast as nancy 's gal pals bess and george , but they only make brief cameos at the beginning of the film . speaking of cameos , chris kattan ( snl ) , eddie jemison ( `` ocean 's 13 '' ) , and bruce willis all make surprise guest appearances , which just proves you never can guess which movie bruce willis will pop up in next . the movie does fail to live up to some potential . it 's mentioned early on that the drews ' new house is heavily booby-trapped , but nancy and her father are done with tripping over booby traps a few minutes after that . also , nancy describes the cold case she 's about to investigate as a murder taking place at an extravagant party , which should yield plenty of potential murderers , but she only encounter a handful of suspects . and while there 's some moments of real suspense during nancy 's adventures , the solution to the case comes out of nowhere , and in the end all possible plot threads are tied up too conveniently and who-cares-who-done-it . ralph sall 's score adds to the movie 's suspense , but the contemporary teenybopper songs woven into the soundtrack are lame . still , i really enjoyed this film , and while the movie is aimed primarily at tween girls , people of any age and gender can enjoy it .
the movie is okay , it has it 's moments , the music scenes are the best of all ! the soundtrack is a true classic . it 's a perfect album , it starts out with let 's go crazy ( appropriate for the beginning as it 's a great party song and very up-tempo ) , take me with u ( a fun pop song ... ) , the beautiful ones ( a cheerful ballad , probably the closest thing to r & b on this whole album ) , computer blue ( a somewhat angry anthem towards appolonia ) , darling nikki ( one of the funniest songs ever , it very vaguely makes fun of appolonia ) , when doves cry ( the climax to this masterpiece ) , i would die 4 u , baby i 'm a star , and , of course , purple rain ( a true classic , a very appropriate ending for this classic album ) the movie and the album are both very good . i highly recommend them !
john waters most accessible film to date is one of his better ones , considering it cut down on all of the campiness and outright vulgarity which seem to litter most of his previous work . sure , the nudity and the sexual references are still there , at least it is presented in a fashion that can not be deemed too foul or disgusting . due to some great casting choices , this film really brought out the silliness associated with modern art and the subjective nature of your modern artist . funny and somewhat lighthearted ( if that is possible for waters ) , this is one of those films i would watch on a rainy day .
`` dance , fools , dance '' is an early crawford-gable vehicle from 1931 . crawford plays a bonnie jordan , a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties , booze , and stripping off her clothes to jump from a yacht and go swimming . this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother ( william blakewell ) penniless . bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith ; her brother goes to work for bootleggers . the head man is jake luva - portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook . later , of course , he would turn into a romantic hero , but in the early '30s , mgm used him as a bad guy . not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity , bonnie cozies up to luva . gable and crawford made a great team . her facial expressions are a little on the wild side , but that , along with her dancing , is one of the things that makes the movie fun . look for cliff edwards , the voice of jiminy cricket , as bert . it 's always interesting to see the precode movies , and `` dance , fools , dance '' is no exception .
father of the pride is a pleasant surprise : it is funny , witty and features some great voice acting . the show is about the family of a lion who is acting as the attraction of siegfried & roy shows . indeed all of them are stereotypes but that 's what makes them so funny . fotp is not a kiddie-cartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way . it is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed . i 'd say i 'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original , i 've seen most of those stereotypes many times before , even in that particular order !
although she is little known today , deanna durbin was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s , a pretty teenager with a perky personality and a much-admired operatic singing voice . this 1937 was her first major film , and it proved a box-office bonanza for beleaguered universal studios . three smart girls concerns three daughters of a divorced couple who rush to their long-unseen father when their still-faithful mother reveals he may soon remarry -- with the firm intention of undermining his gold-digger girlfriend and returning him to their mother . although the story is slight , the script is witty and the expert cast plays it with a neat screwball touch . durbin has a pleasing voice and appealing personality , and such enjoyable character actors as charles winninger , alice brady , lucile watson , and mischa auer round out the cast . a an ultra-light amusement for fans of 1930s film . gary f. taylor , aka gft , amazon reviewer
sure , 65 years have passed since thalberg 's last production was filmed . but fellow imdb members , come on , this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the 30 's ! it is a 10 . this was the first movie i saw at new york 's museum of modern art , around 1970 ( i was a teenager ) . expensive looking yet with scenes of such poverty , masterfully photographed , often thrilling , and always engaging , to me it was mgm movie-making at its best . what did audiences feel when they glimpsed a locust attack , the person by person destruction of a mansion , the horrific poverty and then the splendor of wealth . last week , those watching the academy awards had a glimpse of the `` senior '' oscar winner in attendance , luise rainer . how grand to see an actress who arguably delivered one of the most masterful , haunting performances in history electing to return for a celebration . ok , so she should not have won the year before ( great ziegfeld ) , but do n't blame luise . talkies were only a decade old when this was released , and her dialogue limited . but as olan , her use of visual and vocal is memorable . large scale and touching , what more could a movie lover want !
this series was a cut above the rest of the tv detective series of the day but somehow did n't find an audience . the idea of a blind detective may not be totally new but added so much to the story . and who could forget pax , the beautiful guide dog in the series ! whilst the stories themselves may have been no better than the average series , the settings , in new orleans , the acting and the music ( i note the comment about the music score in other comments ... i remember that clearly ) all work to make a good television series even better ! well you never know ... one day paramount might just dig into its archives and release it on dvd !
i thought it was a very funny movie . i love dog movies and comedy movies so combined they were twice as good . k-9 , k-911 , and k-9 pi are my favorite movies . jim belushi is hysterical and jerry lee is hilarious and adorable they make a great team . the only downside is that i really did n't understand how dooley 's wife died . she died before this movie but how ? if they said it i must have missed it . other than that i give it two thumbs/tails up ! those dogs ( jerry lee and zeus ) must have had a lot of training . they were so funny and all the noises jerry lee would make when dooley was talking to him was so funny . my favorite was when jerry lee sang and when he would bite peoples privates to get information very very funny lol
this is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made . amitabh as a country bumpkin , arjun singh , is hilarious . the best thing is the laughter never stops . the plot is a same-old same-old story where child is separated from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end . there are villains ( ranjit ) and there are brothers ( sashi kapoor ) and there are vixens ( parveen babhi ) and there are lovers ( smita patil ) and there is a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in for good measure . but this movie is about amitabh and thats all you remember at then end . amitabh comes to the city to make a decent living and his dialogue delivery and mannerisms are hilarious . later in the movie he turns into the angry young man he is famous for but the humour stays . memorable parts include his walking , talking and speaking english , the song ( pad gungaroo re bhand , meera nachi thi ) and everything with his dadoo . all in all i was rolling with laughter throughout the movie . if you want 3 hours of entertainment with amitabh at his absolute best - this is it . it will easily give it a 10/10 .
i had seen marion davies in a couple of movies and really could n't understand her appeal . she could n't dance for peanuts , she did n't attempt to sing and as for her acting - she seemed in a trance . but i had n't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful . rather than kidding her own image , as has been suggested here , to me it seems a satire on gloria swanson , who did start off in slapstick comedies , went on to highly emotional women 's pictures and did end up marrying a count . marion , a top mimic , also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand , that was gloria swanson spot on ! ! ! colonel pepper ( dell henderson ) has motored all the way from georgia to hollywood , determined to prove that his daughter , peggy , ( marion davies ) will be the greatest star ever . their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet billy boone ( william haines ) who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get peggy a job . peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic . they convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success . charlie chaplin asks for her autograph but she does n't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely . `` who was that short little guy '' - when she finds out she faints ! ! ! peggy and billy get a call from high art studio but only peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way . there is a funny scene where she sees a star she does n't think much of - it 's marion davies ! ! ! she finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress - but she ca n't cry ! ! ! it is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds , she ca n't stop ! ! ! her new leading man , andre ( paul ralli ) convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated - she even adopts a new name - patricia pepoire ! ! ! she also seems to have forgotten billy and her dad - she has developed a `` star '' personality ! ! ! when the slapstick studio picks the same location as `` patricia 's '' movie , billy is thrilled to see her but quite unprepared for her snobby attitude . when she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew . after a studio luncheon ( a magnificent panning shot of some of the greatest stars of the day ) `` patricia '' gets a call from the boss . it seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them - the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old peggy back . she and andre decide to get married , she dreams of being a countess ( even though billy says that andre used to serve him spaghetti in a little cafe downtown and is no more a count than he is ) . on her wedding day , billy visits and after a hilarious custard pie fight she realises that billy is the one for her . it was amazing to see all the guest stars - john gilbert is seen going through the mgm gates , lew cody is talking to elinor glynn , who not only wrote `` it '' but several racy romances that were made into mgm movies . william haines , another actor whose movies i had always wanted to see , was great - especially in the cafeteria scene , he had wonderful comic timing . harry gribbon was hilarious as the comedy director - there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and marion was at the top of them all - i 'm giving this film 10 out of 10 . highly , highly recommended .
the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarah 's own stand up ; it 's so over the top with prejudice that you ca n't possibly take it to heart . the fact is , though , that while most all people will `` get it , '' it does n't mean they will all appreciate it . it 's a very polarizing and one dimensional show , so if you do n't like it after 10 minutes , you may as well give up there . if you do like it after 10 minutes , stay tuned , because every episode thus far has been as good as the last . like all shows , though , it is not perfect . personally i love the program , but there are some huge faults with it . racist songs are funny , but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realize -- a problem that i had with `` jesus is magic '' as well . it seems as if silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that does n't need to exist . not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good , the music , well , is n't . another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python , upright citizens brigade , etc. , it is nothing like those shows . i can watch monty python all day , but , as much as i like this show , i ca n't watch more than the half hour limit at a time . it gets flat very fast . the repeat value for this show is low too -- the second time around an episode is fairly funny , and by the third time , in my opinion , it 's boring . still , that first time around is very , very funny . give it a shot .
finally ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i 've been waiting for this film to come out for almost a year , and finally saw it at the premiere in sb . i met a few of the actors , who were really nice and who were great in the movie . i watched the trailer so many times that i did n't know what to expect but got totally sucked in . the film was really beautiful to look at it and the music was good too . i recommend it to anyone who 's a ryan donowho fan , and dominique swain was good in it too . the other actors were good also great . i hope it comes out on dvd soon ! ! ! ! ! i first got into ryan from watching the oc and then saw him in a bunch of good indies like imaginary heroes . he is great in this film , and everything that he does that 's indie . i also like dominique but have n't seen her in as much . hope to see them both in more soon ! ! !
first off , i did n't know what to expect when i started the video . anytime someone brings back a cult type movie genre and adapts it into the present , something gets inexplicably lost in the translation . that 's not the case here . this movie just starts off on the right track . it 's part familiar territory but manages to take it over the top as well . crockzilla scene anyone ? that has to be seen , and just try and keep a straight face . this movie takes some of the old fun cult movie classics and manages to blend it seamlessly into a modern production . it 's good to see someone is filling the need in this market . very well done .
i 'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing , acting and cinematography of jake 's closet . the emotions were very real and intense showing , through a child 's eyes , the harsh impact of divorce . a definite see ! i 'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing , acting and cinematography of jake 's closet . the emotions were very real and intense showing , through a child 's eyes , the harsh impact of divorce . a definite see !
back to the roots with `` like it is in heaven '' - what are the real values of life ? these swedes carve out a message that appeals to every heart . we 've seen it twice now in a cinema packed to the last seat : love pure and joy within the music of a choir that 's simple , yet full of power once everyone finds his or her inner tone . from the glitter of fame to the school of of his youth , now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after collapsing on stage , daniel wants to start listening and is drawn into the lives of the simple , warm and rough people of the north . he wins the hearts with music and gains the capacity to love and be loved unconditionally . do n't go see it if you 've been normed to hollywood . this stuff contains no extras , just your laughter , your compassion , your tears !
there 's some very clever humour in this film , which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors . however , after a while it just seems an exercise in style ( notwithstanding great gags such as balasko continuing the part of dussolier , and very good acting by all involved ) and i was wondering why blier made this film . all is revealed in the ending , when blier , directing claude brasseur , gets a phone call from his dad ( bernard blier ) - from heaven , and gets the chance to say how much he misses him . an effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt . but there is n't really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it 's entire running time . some really nice scenes and sequences , however , and anyone who likes these 'mosntres sacrés ' of the french cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film .
as a community theater actor who works hard at it but does n't take acting too seriously , i 'm always amused by those who treat it as great art . this movie skewers the `` actor 's craft '' mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughs . a ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator . when the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food , the actor is kidnapped and forced to play `` the part of a lifetime '' by the neo-nazi head of the secret service . he plays it to the hilt , gets the dictator 's girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa , and turns the tables on his captors beautifully . lots of great shtick by the leads , lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors , particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard , and fun little cameos abound . sammy davis jr. makes light of himself , jonathan winters plays a semi-retired american businessman with something else going on , and raul julia , sonia braga , and above all richard dreyfuss are exceptional . this is a dumb movie , but it has lots of beautiful locations ( in brazil ) , a humorous script , and good actors doing their thing and looking like they 're actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only play-acting !
diego armando maradona had been sixteen years of age in 1978 when argentina won the world cup at home . he was already the biggest star , and the greatest player in a country obsessed with football . everybody had begged cesar luis menotti to play the boy genius , but the manager thought that he was not yet ready . history records that argentina won the 1978 world cup fairly convincingly - they had n't really needed maradona . the same was not true in 1982 . spain was a catalogue of disaster for argentina . menotti - still chain smoking - played diego this time , but the occasion was too much for such a temperamental boy . maradona had signed for barcelona on june 4 1982 for around $ 7 million - nine days later he played his first game at the camp nou and belgium beat argentina one-nil . it was not an auspicious debut , and even though he scored twice against hungary in the next match , maradona will remember the mundial as the site of his nadir - a crude , petulant foul on brazil 's batista in the second round that abruptly ended his tournament and argentina 's reign as world champions . but now that was all behind him . maradona had muddled his way through some crazy times at barca , and left in 1984 to join napoli . it was as if he was finally home . the neapolitan tifosi had done everything to entice maradona to poor , underachieving napoli . gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys nestled uncomfortably with the camorra 's millions as part of the transfer fee , and the city was determined to make him feel at home . so , for the time being at least , maradona was el rey - he brought his argentine side to mexico as one of the favourites , and with a new manager - carlos bilardo replacing menotti . maradona is the hero of this story , a one-man world cup winning machine . in 1982 , hundreds of young men had died in a pointless battle for the falkland isles ; now the british press yearned for a rematch ( with the same result ) in mexico city . maradona was still regarded with distinction in england , remembered more for a superb performance in britain during a 1980 tour than for spain . but he was still an argie : the enemy . england actually started well , and lineker could have scored after only twelve minutes . a key event happened on 8 minutes . fenwick , the big and limited english defender , was booked - he was now terrified of making any challenges around the penalty area . after a tense first 45 minutes , the second half started with a bang . maradona danced forward after 50 minutes , but could find no way through . similarly valdano 's attempt hit only white shirts . then the moment of infamy that serves as diego 's epitaph . hodge bizarrely hooked the ball back into his own penalty area , shilton hurriedly jumped to claim - but there was maradona , somehow rising above the english goalkeeper to thrust the ball into the net . how had he done it ? simple : handball . the most famous foul in football history passed in near slow motion . every spectator waited for mr al-sharif of syria to blow for the foul ( he did n't ) . shilton looked and appealed to the linesman - he ran back to the centre circle . unless he assassinates the pope , or becomes the first man to step foot on mars , when the great man dies this moment will be shown first - in long , lingering , slow motion , followed by the look of glee on his face . the next image will be his next gift to the world - the world cup 's finest goal . burruchaga stroked the ball to maradona who was ambling around on the right hand side of his own half . he span , and accelerated away from beardsley and reid . this was the real diego - he burst through butcher and attacked fenwick . fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack . normally , he would have aimed his boot somewhere near maradona 's thigh - sure he would have picked up a red card , but who cares ? then fenwick had a brainwave - he hesitated , and decided to run at maradona waving his arms - perhaps he was trying to put him off ? diego shot into the box as fenwick fell over . butcher had been running alongside the genius as if he was offering encouragement . shilton charged out in panic , and maradona twisted around him and prepared to score . now butcher remembered his role and tried to cripple the argentinean - instead he gave extra impetus to the shot , which smashed into the goal . england were coming home . during this magical mexican summer , the world had found a successor for pele . in fact the greatest ever footballer had been surpassed - pele had been superb in 1958 and 1970 , but had had great players all around him . maradona did not . 1986 was his world cup .
i was lucky enough to see zero day last night . it 's an amazing movie . a very disturbing one at that . in a way , zero day is very comparable to `` the blair witch project '' . it 's shot completley with handheld camcorders . it 's about 2 kids . just your average kids . andre and calvin . they start a campaign against there high school entitled `` army of 2 '' . the whole story is told in video diary form , from the 2 kids . it shows there relationships with there parents , amongst other people , showing that these are just normal kids , just like people we know or who have bumped into . we find out the army of 2 's last mission will be entitles zero day . they plan to shoot up there high school . you see how they get access to there guns , how they plan it out , everything . they stress that the media has not affected them at all , and there is no reason for doing this . like i said , this is all told in video diary form , and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after zero day . the actual shooting is shown through survillence cameras throughout the school . chilling indeed . the movie is very chilling . some of the things they say , how they plan it out , you 'd just have to see it for yourself . one quote that i remember is the only time calvin is byhimself . he says `` andre thinks were just gon na leave in some getaway car , doing this to numerous schools across the country . i do n't know what he 's thinking , but the only way i 'm coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag '' . i 'm probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film . you really need to see it yourself . it 's going around festivals right now . a+ .
a wonderful and gritty war film that focuses on the inner torment of blinded marine al schmid . although it is tough and unpleasant it is in the end heroic - schmid 's triumph over disability and depression . the battle scene was superb . but one bone to pick . no matter how many .50 bullets they fired i never saw any water or dirt being kicked up by the impacts ! it hurt the realism , but i can live with it . fine performance by eleanor parker , again , as his girl friend .
the cast was good , and i thought it was a good performance from christopher lloyd , whom i like from previous movies . the movie was a great family movie , nothing that would make you worry to show it to younger kids , a good story line , lots of laughs , lighthearted and enjoyable . if you want to entertain children without being bored to tears this fits the bill . kid pleasing , and not difficult for a parent to watch , either .
first of all , when people hear 'guy ritchie ' , they immediately think of snatch . yes , snatch was a good movie , but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch . they do n't expect him to explore new frontiers . this movie revolver is different than snatch ; it 's much darker and is very complex . the reason i gave a rating of 10 is because i 've had to watch revolver 3 times to understand everything . so this movie toys with your head . it 's very cleverly written . this movie is different than snatch . it was done wonderfully , the cinematography is beautiful , and you can recognize guy ritchie 's personal touch ( style of directing ) in it . what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers .
robert duvall is a direct descendent of confederate general robert e. lee , according the imdb.com movie database . after seeing this film , you may think duvall 's appearance is reincarnation at it 's best . one of my most favorite films . i wish the composer , peter rodgers melnick had a cd or there was a soundtrack available . wonderful scenery and music and `` all too-true-to-life , '' especially for those of us that live in , or have moved to , the south . this is a `` real moment in time . '' life moves on , slowly , but `` strangers we do not remain . ''
michelle rodriguez is the defining actress who could be the charging force for other actresses to look out for . she has the audacity to place herself in a rarely seen tough-girl role very early in her career ( and pull it off ) , which is a feat that should be recognized . although her later films pigeonhole her to that same role , this film was made for her ruggedness . her character is a romanticized student/fighter/lover , struggling to overcome her disenchanted existence in the projects , which is a little overdone in film ... but not by a girl . that aspect of this film is n't very original , but the story goes in depth when the heated relationships that this girl has to deal with come to a boil and her primal rage takes over . i have n't seen an actress take such an aggressive stance in movie-making yet , and i 'm glad that she 's getting that original twist out there in hollywood . this film got a 7 from me because of the average story of ghetto youth , but it has such a great actress portraying a rarely-seen role in a minimal budget movie . great work .
one of the best records of israel 's response to the murder of rabin.extremely true and natural , it captured the spirit of the nation.especially important was the response of young people to the trauma of israel 's loss and the feeling that we shall overcome .
this film was just brilliant , casting , location scenery , story , direction , everyone 's really suited the part they played , and you could just imagine being there , robert redford 's is an amazing actor and now the same being director , norman 's father came from the same scottish island as myself , so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film , the witty remarks throughout the film were great , it was just brilliant , so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch , and the fly-fishing was amazing , really cried at the end it was so sad , and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good , and this definitely was , also congratulations to the two little boy 's that played the part 's of norman and paul they were just brilliant , children are often left out of the praising list i think , because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film , but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done , do n't you think ? the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone 's life after all that was shared with us all .
a unique film ... one of the best of all time . acting , script , quincy jones ' score , cinematography , editing , etc . -- just fantastic . as most viewers know , this movie is based on truman capote 's book about the famous murder of a kansas farm family ( the clutters ) by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery . i 've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film . the actors are solid across the board , but the focus is on the killers , dick and perry , and the law enforcement team pursuing them . scott wilson , as dick hickock is amazing . cocky , twitchy , and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming , oily and plausible . robert blake as perry smith is extraordinary as well -- lonely , and at once empathetic and cold-blooded . who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it ? he does , and it 's brilliant ! a key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime , and these two actors make it work beautifully . both had moments in their subsequent careers , but these performances are high water marks , and that stands for acting period . the cops are wonderful too . leading the investigation is john forsythe , but the other three detectives are great as well . unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles , these are just genuine flatfeet , working the case with determination and competence . they seem so real . i 've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity ; and i 've seen most of the crime classics going way back . really one of a kind in this respect . partial spoiler coming ( this movie 's unique in that you already know what 's happened , but i 'm warning for the record ) . of course , the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations -- the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks , mano a mano . this movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you 'll ever see on film . watch dick and perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel , unaware the cops have the goods on them . but the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions . this is some of the best acting you 'll ever see . think glengarry glen ross without the showboating . to help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story , icb was filmed at the actual clutter house , and i 've heard the clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel . it works . these seem like decent , simple folk . it makes the crime so palpable and sad . i 'll stop here . it 's not a feel-good movie , but it is one of the best movies ever made , and so unique , it 's mandatory viewing for every film buff .
what a great movie ! this is so reminiscent of the wonderful disney classic family movies of the 60 's and the 70 's . i was so pleasantly surprised , after the past 20 years of absolute detritus disney 's live productions crews have churned out . this movie is an absolute joy . the child stars were just that ; professional , quality actors . i am most impressed with the quality of this movie . sigourney weaver was a total sycophantic * insert hyperbole here * running a prison camp for wayward boys . siobhan fallon was wonderful as the star 's mother . i wo n't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again , but the story is wonderful , the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was superb ! this work reminds you what it 's like to be a child , without going all sugary or being too grim . the deleted scenes featured on the dvd version were truly best left deleted . they were too harsh for this movie and would have taken so much from it . while the abuse was hinted in the finished product , it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent . it was best that way . this was an absolutely delightful movie to watch . it gets a 9/10 from ... the fiend : .
now i love american pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for seann william scott 's performance as stifler but after that the quality has dropped . band camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but naked mile was the same joke and plot- lines recycled ( erik stifler 's sex problem is like jim 's ) . it had some amusing moments like the football game against the midgets and the 'punishment ' of coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'mile ' was just stupid and moronic . not to mention the irritating girlfriend who does n't want to have sex . anyway enough about the naked mile . i watched beta house with apprehension as i thought it could take the series to a new low but i was pleasantly surprised . to be honest there is no real plot but it 's filled with hot girls ( ashley is incredible ) and sex jokes aplenty . yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but dwight stifler ( steve talley ) raises the bar with an exuberant performance . the greek olympiad is entertaining especially the penultimate and final events while christopher mcdonald 's cameo is hilarious . there are weak points though . coozeman is as irritating as he was in the first , i 'm still baffled to as how he ever got a part . while coozeman is bad erik stifler is worse . john white made naked mile a pain to watch but in beta house he takes his performance to a whole new low . first and foremost he lacks charisma , a stifler prerequisite . you really ca n't care less about him . the only reason i was bothered about his relationship was so ashley could be on screen ! she shines above him as does the rest of the cast . seriously john white is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish . saying that the film does entertain and coozeman 's fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny . overall this film is worth renting , get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit-fest event and vent your anger at erik 'loser ' stifler .
the gang of roses . `` every rose has its thorns . '' a mix of old western and hip hop , blended perfectly together . the clothing styles , the scenery , and the plot are all suited to what the director wanted . plot - in five years , they robbed twenty-seven banks and then vanished without a trace . now , a small western town is under siege , and one of the first victims is rachel 's sister . the rose gang is ready to ride again . and this time it 's personal . rachel ( michael calhoun ) , chastity ( lil ' kim ) , maria ( lisaraye ) , zang li ( marie matiko ) and kim ( stacey dash ) , five gunslinging women who split up after five years of riding together . when rachel 's sister is killed , she ends up rounding up her friends once again and riding on a trail of vengeance . a good , muck around version of western . ( if you 've seen bad girls , well this is a little bit better in the ways of the female characters ) . i gave it 10/10 because the characters , plot and scenery made it for me .
family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about . love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about . one man , daddy , has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity . the kids grow up , one all be it , in the hard way , to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is , the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall . all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances . yes , i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent . this true to life is one which every young adult , and parent , would do well to see , although some will not realize it until they too are parents . a must see for those who care about their families .
a frolics of youth short subject . a teenager , embarrassed by his fear of dogs , runs away from home . the abandoned spaniel he finds helps to change his mind . pardon my pups is an enjoyable little film , with shirley temple stealing all her scenes as the hero 's lively kid sister . the opening gag - dealing with bedwetting - is in poor taste , but is quickly forgotten . highlight : the climactic fisticuffs , which look impressively realistic . often overlooked or neglected today , the one and two-reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents , both in front & behind the camera . the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film , something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel . economical to produce in terms of both budget & schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material , short subjects were the perfect complement to the studios ' feature films .
kenneth branagh shows off his excellent skill in both acting and writing in this deep and thought provoking interpretation of shakespeare 's most classic and well-written tragedy . kenneth plays the role of hamlet with such a distinct emotion that provokes tears . kate winslet 's performance is also of great note .
that 70s show is the best tv show ever , period . it 's up there with the andy griffen show , saturday night live , and the simpsons in my book . that 70s show continued on for 8 seasons , all of which focus around a group of teenagers/young adults dealing with relationships , separating from their parents , and their overall futures . the two main characters , eric and donna , are two teenagers living next door to each other . they have been living next door to each other for most of their lives , and just begin to feel more feelings for each other at the beginning of the first season . a large amount of the show revolves around how their relationship is working . two other characters , red and kitty , are eric 's parents . red was in the service , so he really pushes eric around . kitty is just the opposite . even though she drinks heavily , she treats eric and his friends with a lot of care . bob , their neighbor , is obviously donna 's dad . bob giggles around with several different women throughout the coarse of the show 's story . bob also annoys red to his full extent . the remaining character , hyde , kelso , fez , and jackie , are eric 's friends . they also play a major role in the show 's story . well , the first season is great . this is when the characters are beginning to feel new things for each other . the first season is original , funny , and enjoyable . the second season is good , although it is n't as good as the first . it is a basic continuation of the first . eric and donna are together , and everything is working out great . the third season is my favorite . it went back and captured the first season feel and humor . i also think that the character chemistry improved a bunch , making the show all that more fun to watch . the fourth season is n't near as good . eric and donna arne't together in this one , making the show slightly less pleasurable . it is still funny , although i did n't enjoy it as much as the previous seasons . the fifth season is the last season i enjoyed all the way through . it is the gang 's senior year , so that really helps with the story . the fifth season also had the best ending out of all the seasons . the sixth season is good for the most part . it is extremely funny , although it does n't capture the feel that the other seasons did . the gang is out of high school , so i believe that it did n't hit the teen feel that the previous seasons did . i also did n't like the last three or four episodes considering that they had a major drama feel to them . the seventh season captures the same feel that the 5th season had in a way , although it did n't do it all the way . i enjoyed the seventh season as i did all the others , and the ending is great . the last season flat out sucked . eric was n't in it , which ruined it . kelso was n't in it for the most part either , which did n't help . i hated the eighth season up until the last episode . i thought that the last episode was really good , and a fitting ending to the series . so overall , if you enjoy comedy , give that 70s show a try . they stopped making new episodes , but it is still on tv a bunch . i also recommend buying seasons 1-7 . it is up to you if you want to buy season 8 .
i think the team behind this film did a very good job with the limitations they had . only £300,000 and 7 weeks to write , film and edit the whole thing which i think is an achievement in itself . although this film is not for the masses ( as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is homo-eroticism involved in the story ) i think that this film is a heart wrenching tragedy and the more deeply involved you get in the story , the more sadness you feel . more so towards heaton because of the love he feels but is not returned . this is one of my favourite british films that i enjoyed very much and would watch again . i think that it 's a shame that is film is not very well heard of at all .
i loved dedee pfeiffer ( is that spelled right ? ) in cybil . have n't seen her for awhile and forgot how much i missed her . i thought she did a great job in this . the supporting cast was pretty good too . in some angles , the daughter even looked like a young nicole kidman . the abductor was pretty creepy and the story generally had some good twists . the young boyfriend was a hottie . i thought the husband definitely had something to do with it for sure . just got the lifetime movie network for christmas and am loving these movies . kept my interest and i 'll watch it again when they rerun it . can anyone else recommend any similar movies to this ? you can post on the board or send me a private email if you want . thanks in advance . aboutagirly .
several features of this film immediately date it . the sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years . the language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques . bette davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career . i do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression . i think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me . somerset maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie-goers . as in so many of her character roles , bette davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred . leslie howard is well cast as the withdrawn english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress . towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street . they cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them . this scene is possibly meant to be funny , but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film . it is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face . and after all as far as we can see ( and hope for ) it is a happy ending .
the often misunderstood zabriskie point is antonioni 's political film , antonioni 's american film . stylistically , it follows suit after `` blow-up '' , meaning that the pace is faster than the previous epics , though certainly no less idiosyncratic . basically the common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation . not so . the two protagonists come from vastly different environments . mark from the `` rebel '' youths , daria from an estate agency corporation . but in true antonioni fashion , they are both alienated , both trying to escape their surroundings . mark leaves a meeting of rebel students and black panthers disappointed with the verbose empty rhetoric , while daria keeps uneasily being on the move with her car . antionioni , the master director , after portraying the rebelling youth as confused and shallow , then moves to the city . an environment saturated by corporatism , billboard advertisements , meaninglessness , that has to keep expanding to accommodate the similar expansion of the population , generating a profit at the same time . it is this environment that the two protagonists escape from , though it seems mostly out of coincidence . indeed , when daria stops by a small village in the outskirts of the desert , the environment is just as suffocating , and the people just as lost cases , best exemplified by an old boxing champion , now reduced to a shadow of himself , sitting around drinking and smoking and talking nonsense . a stunning melancholy sequence , made even more powerful with the inclusion of some half wild children living around , brought in by some `` benefactor '' but `` destroying a genuine piece of american history '' . in a not-so-obscure symbolism , there is antonioni 's opinion on the hippies . just a half-positive glimpse in the canvas of human alienation . and then there is the desert , the landscape used to devastating effect , by turns pure and terrifying , primeval , wild and dead . the sequence where the two protagonists make love , `` joined '' in fantasy by the `` flower '' generation reflects the similar sequence in `` red desert '' , where giuliana tells her son a story . it is a colourful intermission in a colourless landscape . a vivid half-fantasy in a suffocating reality . the ending probably belongs to the pantheon of great endings in cinema , the western civilization blown to pieces . a catharsis , an exorcism . antionioni 's two `` international '' films ( the british `` blow-up '' and the american `` zabriskie point '' ) are lesser efforts than the previous masterpieces , but that is largely because of the faster pace and the inevitably contrived settings ( swinging london , flower-power america ) . but when it comes down to it , it 's clear he has n't lost the edge .
a movie you start watching as a late night cable porn ..... it is hot in that department but it has even a lot more .... it has a sense of humor ... some action in and out of the `` bed '' and it has reasonable acting as well as a story worth watching ... a definite adult only movie but well worth watching ...
wow ... what ... a whirlwind . the 30 's is a decade with plenty of movies of every type i can imagine , especially during the early talkies phase . there were movies which are painfully static and dull , like `` dracula '' with bella lugosi , and there were those that just do n't give it a rest , sometimes in a good way and other times not . this is one of the films that do n't stop for a minute , and that is both a wonder and a pity . lloyd bacon , who also directed `` 42nd street '' , must have been the king of the depression era musicals and he was probably excited with the possibilities sound brought to the world of cinema , for he filled this picture with it . there must n't be a full minute or two without music or someone speaking . it 's completely crazy ! i was thinking the movie deserved a 5 ( or a 6 , tops ) because the pacing was very poor , since it was insanely fast and i sometimes did n't know what was happening and what to think . the characters seemed to just running to and fro places , talking about things which did n't interest me and probably no one else . i thought i was just going to be rewarded with a small headache . i noticed lloyd bacon also cast the female lead in `` 42nd street '' , ruby keeler , and `` 42nd street '' was a movie whose ending was the best part of it . and you know what ? it happened the same thing with `` footlight parade '' ! the ending is absolutely incredible ! it has become , hands down , the most impressive musical i have ever seen . the final part presents us some musical numbers and those are , believe me , something that make seeing the other rest of the movie worth . the numbers are flawless ! there are three big bits and the most impressive is surely the second one . suddenly the screen was filled with gorgeous and inventive camera work , beautiful people and plain entertainment that made me forget my small headache .
i chose to see the this film on the day it opened nationally in france , as a personal way for myself to reflect on what had happened a year previous ; the collection works as intended : it provokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions , working as an intellectual hommage , never stooping to cheap sentimentality nor knee-jerk reactionism . there have been many allegations made that the film is anti-american : while i can not speak for everyone in this regard , i am one american who found such statements to be completely untrue . people make much noise about the egyptian segment , by chahine , because it voices perspectives of palestinian suicide bombers asserting that civilians in a democracy are `` fair targets '' for they elect the governments the bombers are seeking to attack , but this ignores much else in the piece : several perspectives are discussed , no one being held up as the truth , and critics -- if they even saw the piece -- seem to forget the fondness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the american dialogue , and the director 's intense sadness upon hearing of the tragedy . pretty much all of the films are beautiful , thoughtful & inspiring , in particular the brilliant work by mahkmalbaf , tanovic , loach & inarritu . nair , good as usual , effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of anti-islam hysteria that swept -- and still sweeps -- the states . i did find gitai 's piece a bit vulgarly loud and simple in it 's critic of media hysteria in the face of terrorism , and penn 's piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes , though i had expected to like it . borgnine is very good and brave in it . spoiler warning : one reviewer below incorrectly read the falling of the towers as being a happy moment for the character ; my read is rather that the falling of the towers is what , because light floods his room , keys him into the loss in his life that he refused to recognize . again this is a sort of impressionistic piece , for we know that if the towers were really blocking the light to this man 's flat , then there would have been nothing but smoke and ash , not light , flooding through his window .
this movie is to halloween what the hilarious `` christmas story '' is to christmas : both are relatively low-budget , no-big-name-stars type films ... and both are two of the absolute greatest and funniest movies available , both seasonal classics ! ! ! `` spaced invaders '' comes galloping out right from the start with warmth and humor and a superb cast of characters ... all five goofy martians , klembecker the realtor , russell the deputy , vern at the `` fuel dispensing depot '' and so many more ! you just have to see this movie to believe it , and , like `` christmas story '' , it just keeps getting better and better with each viewing , and you pick up on fun little things each time ! ! most definitely a ten ! ! !
perhaps the funniest 'backstage at hollywood ' movie ever , especially for a look at comedy short factories like keystone . marion davies should get a medal for bravery for taking a part where acting poorly in front of a camera is part of the role . plenty of cameos for film buffs .
it takes a little while to get used to nick nolte 's nebraskan locutions before we can easily accept him as a famous intercontinental playwright . once you get past the bar , it turns into a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good . nolte , an american , moves to germany , marries a famous actress , and is a satisfied success in every respect until war is about to break out . he 's visited by a jovial american , john goodman , who persuades him to accept a post as an anti-semitic radio broadcaster for the nazis . nolte has no politics but thinks it 's a challenge to write a role that 's almost impossible and then play it himself . another american secret agent will modify nolte 's radio scripts -- inserting a cough here , a sneeze there -- that will serve as a code for the transmission of intelligence to the allies . there 's a catch , though . nobody will know about nolte 's real role as an american agent except goodman , donovan , and roosevelt himself . if he 's ever uncovered , he 'll be refused recognition by the americans . nolte plunges ahead and his vicious broadcasts are wildly popular in germany . his adored wife , sheryl lee , knows nothing of what 's going on , nor does she care . nolte and lee live in what he repeatedly refers to as `` a nation of two . '' the war ends and the trouble begins . he 's captured by americans who are bitter because of his betrayal . they beat him and leave him in the mud . he 's rescued by goodman , his `` fairy godmother '' , who sends him to an anonymous existence in greenwich village and sends him a little cash now and then . by 1960 , he manages to cultivate a friendship with his neighbor , the painter alan arkin , who has also lost his family and claims the two now belong to a secret brotherhood . but his location and his identity somehow leak out and he is more or less adopted by a group of ancient aryan racists -- led by a dentist and a priest . his house front and mailbox are painted with swastikas and accusations . he 's beaten senseless by an ex-gi . but -- miraculously -- his beloved wife is returned to him by the ancient aryans . another catch : it turns out later that it 's not his wife , but rather her younger sister who has loved him since adolescence . the ending has him typing his memoirs in an israeli jail in 1967 before his trial for crimes against humanity . it 's not a happy ending . nolte can talk with , but not see , the occupant of the cell above his in jail . it 's adolf eichmann . eichmann seems pleasant enough . he advises nolte that it 's a bad habit to type for fifteen straight hours . `` it 's important to relax . you must learn to relax . '' nolte laughs out loud and shouts , `` that 's how i got here . '' the film is filled with such ironies . at one point in their relaxed conversations , arkin tells him that `` in spite of everything i still think people are good at heart . '' i do n't know if the movie was a commercial success but if it was n't , that 's the sort of thing that might have torpedoed it for a younger audience of theater-goers who may never have heard of anne frank let alone that supposedly final statement in her diary . the fact is that it 's a movie for adults , and patient adults at that . the story moves slowly , there 's very little violence , no car chases , no shootings , and people do n't seem subject to manic speech pressure . a lot of it will probably slip past viewers who do n't open themselves to its deliberate approach . nolte refers to the war-time relationship between him and his wife as `` a nation of two . '' this is a pretty compact phrase . no doubt anyone could come up with a glib definition but it takes a little concentration to grasp its emotional import . it 's a story of a man who loses everything -- his ability to write , his identity , his wife ( twice ) , his sole friend , his country , his self respect . at one point he stops walking along a crowded new york street and simply stands there until after dark , when he is moved along by a curious cop . the reason he stopped is that he simply has no place to go . what vonnegut is describing is far more than depression . i do n't mean to sound condescending but it 's the sort of feeling that 's hard to understand in your youth . adolescents might like to think they know what 's holding nolte in that one spot , but it really requires maturity and the quickened sense of finiteness that only maturity can bring . remember robert frost 's line about home being the place that when you go there they have to take you in ? well no place will take nolte in .
now , many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title . if you do not have the stomach for gory movies , then what are you doing reading this review ? anyhow , i borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately . this movie is chock full of wonderful gore , plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b-movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience ! if you 're a lover of good quality experiences , then by all means , watch this great flick !
lovely piece of good cinema . this is one of those films that you see smiling and you do not know why . well , one of the reasons could be that we are before one of the most surprising directors today , and he is able to film emotions . when you are watching the film you can feel what mr. straight was feeling when he took the decision to go to visit his brother with his `` marvellous '' john deere . what changed in his mind ? , what changed in your mind when you watched this film ? a beautiful fraternal love story .
i really enjoyed this movie . the acting by the adult actors was great , although i did find the main kid a little stiff . but he carried himself very well for being a new talent . the humor is very sublime and not in your face like most hollywood comedy junk . i.e . the nutty professor . if you have a short attention span and are used to the typical hollywood stuff you probably would n't like this as it is a bit slower paced . i picked it up on blu-ray and i have to say the image quality is top notch . probably one of the better looking blu-rays i 've seen so far . the extras were cool too . they deleted quite a bit , but that 's probably a good thing as most of the deleted scenes did n't really add anything .
this video rocked ! eddie is one of the funniest comics i have ever seen . not only does he have class , he makes some of the funniest observations on history and culture that i have ever seen . eddie is the most original and most intelligent comic i 've seen in a very long time . tell all those other stand-ups to get off the stage and let this `` executive '' reign !
an utterly beautiful film , one of a handful of i saw when young that entranced me then and still do , in thief 's case the impression actually seems to get better with the passing of time . by the '90 's my daughter and i had seen it many times on tv but still went to the pictures when it came to the local art-house cinema  when it had finished we came out starry eyed with heads full of poetry and miklos rozsa 's stirring music wishing it could have lasted a couple of hours longer and thinking what a beautiful world it suddenly was again . idealistic prince ahmad wants to slum it amongst his people for a while to check things out , but evil vizier jaffar takes his chance to imprison him and seize the throne . after escaping with a little thief played by sabu , ahmad spots a princess and they fall blindingly in love  along the way they have many adventures ( although apparently not enough for sabu ! ) and love not only conquers but annihilates everything . the special effects must have been mesmerising in 1940 , but time has taken its toll and lessened their impact especially since digital cartoonery has taken over even live action  but they still hold up well compared against films like superman from 40 years later . anyway , if i 'm requested to suspend disbelief in gargantuan guffawing genies , flying horses and carpets i also suspend disbelief in perfect special effects ! favourite bits : the dreamy scene in the sunlit garden when ahmad reveals himself and adelaide hall 's suitably romantic song ; the stunning colours in the tent in the land of legend  in fact , the stunning colours throughout ; sabu and rozsa 's triumphant but still wistful finale . conrad veidt played the baddie in two of the most incredible movie romances ever , this and casablanca , and then died . john justin and june duprez were great in the leading roles of lovers , both of them slightly and refreshingly stilted , but the parts did n't call for a huge range of emotions : only pure love mattered . there 's a couple of mildly violent images in it , but rest assured this is a glorious feelgood experience with a 100 % positive message , it 's only a pity that nowadays little kids do n't watch this instead of the porn they prefer . one of my top 10 film favourites , i ca n't recommend this too much  may it be shown to the end of time .
`` 8 simple rules ... for dating my teenage daughter , '' is my opinion , is an absolute abc classic ! i 'm not sure i have n't seen every episode , but i still enjoyed it . it 's hard to say which episode was my favorite . however , i think it was always funny when a mishap occurred . i always laughed at that . despite the fact that james garner and david spade were good , i liked the show more when john ritter was the leading man . if you ask me , his sudden passing was very tragic . everyone always gave a good performance , the production design was spectacular , the costumes were well-designed , and the writing was always very strong . in conclusion , i hope some network brings it back on the air for fans of the show to see .
ok , basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie , but from the outset its obvious that it has been directed with a great deal of intelligence . you can count about 10 clichés that the film is building up to , but it only delivers on about three of them , and a couple of them have a twist to them that lets you know once again that the director has n't assumed that you are an idiot . kurt russell 's acting is truely superb and brings a depth from the character that is suprising and rewarding . recommended if you 've just seen something really stupid , and want to rebuild your faith !
there is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where homer watches the attempt of december 6 , 1957 ( at least that was the video used on the tv he was watching ) which showed the vangard launch attempt , which failed . he is next shown reading or dictating a letter to dr . von braun offering condolences about the failure . von braun was at marshall space flight center in huntsville working for the army . the vanguard project was by the early nasa team which was at what soon became goddard space flight center . the army rushed the jupiter-c , which was essentially a us made v2 technology , but worked to launch a satellite in response to russia 's success with sputnik . this error may have actually been made by homer , because of the notoriety of von braun , but his team did n't have their attempt fail . in fact the underlying redstone was flying from 52 and was the first us man rated booster , used for shepard 's sub orbital flight , as well as grissom 's . this is why this sort of movie is so good , as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia , and in the process see what has been done , and be inspired to do more .
one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers , an observation which mystifies me . not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee , it had many young actors who were to become major stars , e.g. , tobey maguire ( before spiderman ) , skeet ulrich ( before jericho ) , jonathan rhys meyers ( before tudors ) , james caviezel , simon baker , mark ruffalo , jeffrey wright , tom wilkinson , and jewel . all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances , especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing . when the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award ) and the actors are listed , this film is usually omitted from their past performances . i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films . however , it is seldom every seen on cable . i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known .
got to this show late - believe it was the 3rd , and final episode , when first watched it - and was blown away by a social commentary that has n't been seen on american tv since 'all in the family ' . was very surprised cbs would even run this in the first place . which is merely to say the last time cbs 'had a set ' - if you know what i mean - was back in the day of 'all in the family ' . the most controversial decision they 're willing to tackle today is how much eye make-up to put on katie couric . if you want to make a bunch of folks really , really mad - let them discover the truth about themselves . and if you want them willing to pull strings , make calls , and get a work of art removed - let them discover that truth by hearing their own words spoken from their own mouths . the aardman folks have always been way ahead of the curve . and this show is no different . somehow it snuck under the cbs 'corporate/social/political/censor radar ' to get it onto the schedule ( perhaps the 'big brass ' never really watched it till it finally aired ? ) , but once good 'ol middle 'merika heard and saw themselves being themselves - well , can bet the farm that message , or the messenger , wo n't last long . now , if only the 'missing episodes ' can find their way onto usenet or bit-torrent ; - ) thank you bc kelly tallahassee fla
ok , first of all , ignore the last person ' review . they admit to falling asleep through it so it 's no wonder they did n't understand what was going on ! ! ! as thriller/horrors go , this film ai n't too bad , it is certainly very watchable . right from the opening scenes you get a general idea exactly what is going to be the cause of all the craziness that follows , and come the end you are proved right with everything being made clear . i enjoyed this movie , it was quite eerie at times and as old films go it was passable . great to watch late at night ! i give it a generous 7 out of 10 .
the nearest i ever came to seeing this was a clip shown at a gerard philippe exposition in paris about two years ago . i had no interest in the remake and having just caught up with the original just over half a century after it was made i can only conclude that the inept fencing was intentional , aimed at a long obsolete target . hollywood had been doing realistic sword fights since the 30s when the greatest of them all , basil rathbone , crossed foils with errol flynn and others so the technique was available and so that leaves only satire . after a while you do n't notice and revel in the henri jeanson dialogue reminiscent of the prisoner of zenda , both versions . gerard philippe certainly had the presence to bring off a role like this and gina lollabrigida was probably a tad better than martine carol , the other obvious candidate at the time . the print i saw was particularly bad and at one point broke down completely so maybe a dvd version would enhance it .
before sunrise is romance for the slacker generation . richard linklater 's romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people . the film depicts romance in all it 's glory , but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples ; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that 's as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem , the problem of time . while most relationships wind down with time , this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out . before sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental 'hollywood romance ' , which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders . the story follows two people , jesse ; an american and celine ; a french girl that meet on a train into vienna . they instantly connect , and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train , jesse asks celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of vienna ... before sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life . this allows the characters to be free , and it 's easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script . this also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are , and not merely because they 're the protagonists . this kind of realism is hard to capture as , at the end of the day , we as the audience know that they 're watching a film and not observing real life ; but before sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen . a truly great script can not work on it 's own , and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice , and although i 'm not a fan of either julie deply or ethan hawke ; on viewing this film , there is nothing you can do but give them both respect . i do n't know whether they were in character or just playing themselves , but when a film is this good ; it hardly matters . in a film like this , it is the writing that 's the most important thing , and contained within the script are several observations about life , most of which i personally could relate to . this represents what richard linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters , but it also manages to expose what true love is , along with several other aspects of life . the fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing . everyone is different , and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people . there could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates ; and that 's the case with the musings in this script . adding to the beauty of the film is the city of vienna . the city itself is n't really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat , energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location . before sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating . richard linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema ; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental . before sunrise is what it is . and what it is , is pure cinematic brilliance .
i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me.i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero 's every week.you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt.we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure.oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies.so any ole way i believe i 've got what i wan na say.would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt.if my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit , or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit , if this is so then i must go so lets do it .
early hollywood at it 's best ! ! a classic kipling poem is transformed into an epic adventure featuring memorable performances by a stellar cast . i think the measure of a good film is how many times you can watch it and still genuinely enjoy it . i 've seen it a dozen times and still cry at the end and , admit it , you do too ! !
i was watching this movie at one of my usual time , which is real real late at night . usually if a movie does n't interest me , i start falling asleep and have to raid the fridge to stay awake . at first i thought that 's what i had to do since this movie 's pacing started off slow , along with the fact that its shots tended to linger with the character for a long time . but after a bit , i start getting more into the movie , as more is revealed about the main character through his story telling . by the end , you feel like you 've known him your whole life . the movie kept my interest so much that i did n't even know the sun was about to rise . not much of lynch 's bizzare style , but there is enough of quirky characters to make the film amusing .
this anime is a must-see for fans of evangelion . it 's an earlier work of anno hideaki , but his unrestrained , dramatic style is quite in place . also , those who did n't like evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable . gunbuster is rather unique to sci-fi anime in that it 's actually based on real science . in fact , the show has several little `` science lesson '' interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie . one of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light . the series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an earth where ten years have passed . the main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably . be warned , this show is heavy on the sap at times . it also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that i have ever seen . i found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo-hoo scenes , because the series is otherwise very good , but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one . on an interesting note , gainax , as always , managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes . however , they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway . the ending is a bit silly , but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut i could n't help but love it . gunbuster is , in my opinion , one of the finest pieces of anime around .
this movie kept me constantly entertained . in comparing this to serial mom , mr . waters has gone back to his grittier side . this is not nearly as polished . there is a dark side here . a message about how success and fame changes a person -- but more importantly how it changes the people around you . there is not a false moment in this film . the characters are somewhat cartoonish ... but i want to believe that is what mr . waters is trying to achieve . it is fascinating to watch how mr . waters has evolved ... this is truly his finest work .
after the unexpected accident that killed an inexperienced climber ( michelle joyner ) . eight months has passed ... the rocky mountain rescue receive a distress call set by a brilliant terrorist mastermind eric quaien ( john lithgow ) . quaien has lost three large cases that has millions of dollars inside . two experienced climbers walker ( sylvester stallone ) and tucker ( micheal rooker ) and a helicopter pilot ( janine turner ) are to the rescue but they are set by a trap by quaien and his men . now the two climbers and pilot are forced to play a deadly game of hide and seek . while quaien is trying to find the millions of dollars and he kidnapped tucker to find the money . once tucker finds the money , tucker will be dead . against explosive firepower , bitter cold and dizzying heights . walker must outwit quaien for survival . directed by renny harlin ( driven , mindhunters , a nightmare on elm street 4 : the dream master ) made an entertaining non-stop action picture . this film is a spectacular , exciting , visually exciting action picture with plenty of dark humour as well . this was one of the biggest hits of 1993 . this is one of harlin 's best film . lithgow is a terrific entertaining villain . stallone certainly made an short comeback of this sharp thriller . this is probably harlin 's best work as a filmmaker . dvd has an sharp anamorphic widescreen ( 2.35:1 ) transfer and an terrific-dolby digital 5.1 surround sound . dvd has an running commentary track by the director with comments by stallone . dvd also has technical crew commentary as well . dvd has behind the scenes featurette , two deleted scenes with introduction by the director and more . do not miss this great action film . screenplay by micheal france ( fantastic four ) and actor : stallone ( the rocky series ) . based on a premise by john long . excellent cinematography by alex thomson , b.s.c . ( alien³ , demolition man , legend ) . oscar nominated for best sound , best sound editing and best visual effects . panavision . ( * * * * / * * * * * ) .
it may have not been up for academy awards and admittedly , it 's pretty cheesy , but it 's just so much fun ! nothing makes me smile like bill and ted . lovable , optimistic , and hilarious , bill and ted are a great way to unwind . although i love excellent adventure , bogus journey is funnier to me . death is flippin hilarious and bill and ted are even more endearing . people give me grief about loving this movie , but only really pretentious movie-watchers will say it 's not even a bit entertaining . if you like this , you 'll probably also be a fan of wayne 's world , dude where 's my car , and dumb and dumber . admit it , though foolish , they make you grin and turn your tickle box over . so watch them just for kicks and giggles ! !
in the mid-1930s hollywood was regaining its confidence after the difficulties of the talkie transition . although all the technical problems of sound had been solved very quickly , it took longer to resolve the questions of how talking pictures should look , how they should be structured and how they should be acted . the informer is a key picture in that it shows the extent to which wordless moments can convey story , asserting the power images without ignoring the necessities of sound and dialogue . this is not to say the informer is truly a throwback to the golden days of the silents . for one thing , many silent pictures were not so purely visual in their narrative , and were overburdened with title cards . but what the informer has is the self-assuredness to extend moments between dialogues , to focus on reactions more than speeches , and to let shots play out simply for atmosphere . director john ford , for all his capability , was a filmmaker who appears to have put in effort in proportion to how interested he was in the material . if he thought a story was silly , he just did it half-arsed . luckily the informer , with its depiction of community , honour , working class life and most importantly irish setting , was everything ford loved , and the result is one of his finest works . in it , ford only really employs too kinds of shot . the first is of places  the dublin streets shrouded in mist and darkness so their furthest depths can not be seen ; dingy interiors where the walls and ceilings seem to press in on us . the second is of faces , striking close-ups against plain backgrounds , usually without dialogue , focusing us upon the inner conflicts of these people . lead man victor mclaglen fits perfectly within this character and this manner of filming him . mclaglen 's performance does not look like much , being as it is about 90 % drunk act . but the other 10 % is heartfelt emoting , as here and there his gypo nolan has what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity . with such performances are oscars won . mclaglen is backed by a spot-on supporting cast , among whom there are no weak links . in particular it is nice to have donald meek and una o'connor , usually only seen in comic relief roles , playing straight dramatic parts for once ( although meek 's appearance does contain one or two jokes , the tone of the scene and much of his manner is serious ) . not only do these two deliver incredibly deep performances , their familiarity to most viewers as comedy players gives an added note of poignancy to their part in this tragedy . rko , who produced the informer , were perhaps the most adventurous and willing to take risks of all the major studios . thanks to this , we are able to see a dismal story with a despicable anti-hero at its centre , which could easily have been a clunky , over-earnest mess , instead filled with a moody atmosphere and depth of character which keeps us watching and draws us into its world .
wow ! so much fun ! probably a bit much for normal american kids , and really it 's a stretch to call this a kid 's film , this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits - very terry gilliam all the way through . while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward , miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moments . the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero , with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein . and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike 's work , the layers of meaning and metaphor , particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly , is pretty damn poignant . as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films , only instead of over the top torture and gore , he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure . f'n rad , and one of miike 's best !
this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail . there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which have n't come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one . this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by reg rogers and ally sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film . at first , the action seems rather off-the-wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves , even if grudgingly , through each other . rogers ' heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and sheedy 's angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them . you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it 's in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread . hopefully audiences will get to see more of reg rogers and ally sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt .
never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the walt disney studios and great animation creations . angela lansbury , ( eglantine price ) played an outstanding role as a woman who had taken a course in witch craft and was an apprentice who was beginning to fly on a broomstick and had quite a few difficulties taking off . eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world . however , eglantine missed her final exams to becoming an accomplished witch . mr. emerlius browne , ( david tomlinson ) was the person who sold eglantine this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution . eglantine has a purpose to her madness and that is to stop the nazi 's from evading england . great family entertainment and we need more films like this today .
although too young to remember the first showing of the series ( being just a baby ) i later caught repeats of it on television in the late 80 's , just when i was getting interested in the war and all of its aspects . it was my grandfather who first showed me the series and also gave me my first interests , relating tales of his time in the royal navy at malta and later in the pacific . since then i have devoured many books and seen many television series about the world war two era , with mixed opinions . the british television stations are generally very good at producing these , as the world at war can easily attest , with many gems made by both the bbc and independent companies . i strongly recommend such titles as `` the nazis - a warning from history '' , `` blitz '' and the bbc series about dunkirk . `` britain at war in colour '' , with its companion series `` japan '' , `` germany '' and `` america '' are of a very high standard . the world at war is by far the best and , despite its age , never fails to deliver . there will always be new revelations about the war that will keep cropping up that obviously are n't included in the series and of course world war two took place over such a large canvas that to produce a series with every detail would take more time and money then any other , even if such an undertaking was even possible . what i feel i must say to those who decry that it does not include everything is that the world at war ca n't physically do that as a series but it sure as heck can prompt you to do further research - and make it enjoyable . that certainly worked for me : i now have a very comprehensive library of books , videos , dvds and tapes and cds . recommend to anyone with even a passing interest . the series was so well made that they 'd find it hard not to agree that it is quality programming and highly informative .
i 've bought certain films on disc even though the second rate presentation was n't an option . a certain company i wo n't identify here has put out several pan and scan dvds ( `` clean and sober '' , `` star 80 '' , and this one , to name just three ! ) of films i do n't think anyone wants to see in this compromised format . some discs give the viewer a choice of 16x9 or full screen and others are just in their theatrical release 1.66:1 ratio . that off my chest , i 'll say `` deathtrap '' was a spooky and oddly enough , amusing picture . my only complaints are the tinny score ( what is that f____g instrument that is usually dragged out for films set in 18th century france ? ) and dyan cannon screaming at regular intervals . could n't her character have been an asthmatic who grabbed for an inhaler when she was stressed ? minor complaints , both . the benefits of discs include being able to fast forward to get beyond those things which you do n't like . i never saw a staged version of `` deathtrap '' , so having these folks in the roles sets a great impression of their careers at the time . before broadway tickets cost an arm and a leg , the theatre was more affordable to average people . now , anyone paying less than a king 's ransom to get live entertainment probably is n't going to a hit show on the great hyped way . michael caine and christopher reeve were both large , virile specimens in the early 80s and that 's integral to how we 'll react to their profession and overall image here . they 're definitely not bookish men who ca n't fight or will back down from an obstacle . the two are equally great as their criminal stubbornness becomes their ultimate `` deathtrap '' .
.... after 16 years tim burton finally disappoints me ! ! ! ! whatever happened to the old burton who read `` the dark knight returns '' by frank miller as research for his preparation to direct batman back in 1988-89 ? by the looks of it burton did n't research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong ! this movie sucks ! it 's not as good as the original and it does n't deal with the same subject as the original . if you want a good ape movie watch the original . * * out of * * * * stars
the matador is better upon reflection because at the time one is watching it , it seems so light . the humor is always medium-gauge , never unfunny but never gut-busting . the story is a very simple thread . the characteristics of the plot are often recycled features , namely the unscrupulous bad guy in need of a pal and the straight-laced glass-wearing good guy in need of security in life team up and learn from each other and somehow complement each other 's lifestyles . i also find the bullfighting parallel to the story unnecessary , as it is a simply cruel thing and the symbolism is hardly potent enough to carry itself . however , it really is a good film , because though it seemed so thin and unaffecting at the time , it was n't . it has a subtle way of connecting with the audience . i believe the reason it slowly but surely gives the audience something to take with them is because though it 's a formula that is nothing new , even most of the humor , both main characters , virtually the only characters in it , are somehow met and gotten to know . forget calling them real . that 's not at all what i mean . what i mean is that though pierce brosnan 's filthy , womanizing , boozing hit man is a detached comical character , he 's grasped firmly by the writer and definitely by brosnan , who is aggressively communicating how much he enjoys his breath of fresh james bondless air . greg kinnear 's character seems quite the same in his detached scriptedness , but he 's given certain very unexpected footnotes that for a moment due to the film 's lightfootedness pass us by but then hit us only a moment later . we then realize the film is not simply analyze this or planes , trains and automobiles told stalely over again . its truly saying something . the film 's climax is of a sort that wants to partially be a thriller with twists . but with its lightness , how can that possibly be the focus of the film , though the plot has been leading up to it ? no , the focus is what brosnan and kinnear get out of their unlikely relationship to each other . strangely , the matador is a film about regret and loneliness . brosnan deals with loneliness and regret every day , and though we do n't understand why kinnear is so lenient and accepting with brosnan continually interrupting his life , it 's slowly understood that brosnan is salvaging kinnear from a more down-to-earth version of his own feelings as a means of redemption . the very last scene of the movie stays with me . it , i think , is where the film 's subtle side-stepping impact finally begins to seep .
rated r for strong language , violent content and some nudity . quebec rating:13+ canadian home video rating:14a fear of a black hat is one of the funniest , most original comedies i have ever seen.its basically a gangsta rap version of the film this is spinal tap.its a shame not many people have heard of this gem of a film.if you manage to find this film anywhere do n't hesitate to buy it even if you do n't like rap music.there are not too many comedy films that i give a perfect 10/10 to.the only ones i can think of at the moment are this film , clerks , the world according to garp , the 40 year old virgin and chasing amy.this film is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta rap culture.the movie is about a woman named nina blackburn who is making a documentary about the fictional rap group n.w.h ( n * * * * z with hats ) .they are basically the stereotype of a rap group making many controversial rap songs about killing and being a gangsta.fear of a black hat is an excellent comedic film and i recommend it even if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene.its a shame this film is not in the top 250 . runtime:88min 10/10
the legendary boris karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in mexico . this is the token moody period gothic horror entry from the bunch . karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as matthias morteval , an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty , greedy and backbiting no-count relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will . pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal life-sized toy people who populate the place . onetime mexican sex symbol andres garcia of `` tintorera '' infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character . the clunky , plodding ( non ) direction , trite by-the-numbers script , ugly , washed-out cinematography , ridiculous murder set pieces ( a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon ! ) , overwrought string score , morbid gloom-doom atmosphere , largely lousy acting ( karloff notably excepted ) , cheesy mild gore , poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm . a real campy hoot .
contrary to some people 's summaries , the women depicted in the film are not geisha . they are oiran ( prostitutes ) living outside the most famous pleasure districts , and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women . i ca n't say the stories were particularly enlightening , but their charm lies in just how typical they are . the themes are universal and everyday : love , friendship , and sacrifice . i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting . i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse . the actors , especially the 4 women who played the main oiran , were a thrill to watch . i 'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture , or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories . it 's a great example of both .
first off , i must say that i made the mistake of watching the election films out of sequence . i say unfortunately , because after seeing election 2 first , election seems a bit of a disappointment . both films are gangster epics that are similar in form . and while election is an enjoyable piece of cinema ... it 's just not nearly as good as it 's sequel . in the first election installment , we are shown the two competitors for chairman ; big d and lok . after a few scenes of discussion amongst the `` uncle 's '' as to who should have the chairman title , they ( almost unanimously ) decide that lok ( simon yam ) will helm the triads . suffice to say this does n't go over very well with competitor big d ( tony leung ka fai ) and in a bid to influence the takeover , big d kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side . this has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war . lok is determined to become chairman but wo n't become official until he can recover the `` dragon head baton '' , a material representation of the chairman 's power . the current chairman , whistle ( chung wang ) has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland china and the race is on to see who can recover it first . much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the baton . as both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides , which leads into one of the stand out scenes in election , which involves an underling named jet ( nick cheung ) , a machete , and lots of bad guys . nick cheung 's presence is attention grabbing to say the least ... i wonder if this influenced director johhnie to in any way while making the second election , as he does deliver more of jet 's character in the sequel . while nick cheung gives a scene stealing performance , i must not fail to give due to the rest of the film 's actors . election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting . simon yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight hk actors like louis koo , tony leung ka fai , and the under-appreciated suet lam . there really are n't any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they 're watching real gangsters . although the performances are great , one of the most impressive things about election is johnnie to 's eye for the camera . there are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that to definitely knows how to frame his shots , as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles . all of which makes election , above all , a great looking film . my issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in election . it gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that are n't integral to the plot . while the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates , the first election offers the election process as a whole with tons of uncles , underlings , and police officers crowding the storyline . maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the triad , or if director johnnie to would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more . bottom line- all in all , this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast , excellent direction , and leisurely pacing that packs a punch . it 's just a little more complicated than it needed to be .
this movie maybe really bad , but it is alot of fun . the bad acting and poor direction enhance the film 's hystericalness . the twins are very funny in their conanesque roles . if you go into this film expecting the first conan or excalibur , than you will hate it . if you watch it while in a good mood and accept it as good , dumb fun you will have a good time . watch for the scene where they try to hang the brothers , its funniest scene in the film . i wish mystery science theatre 3000 would have done this ! !
it appears that there 's no middle ground on this movie ! most of it takes place in a dream and , like most dreams , it 's often foolish and illogical . it 's also a gorgeous production with some great songs and fine performances , especially by our angel . jeanette 's deadpan , unknowing insults and various other faux pas at the dream reception are hilarious , and her jitterbug with binnie barnes is a surprise and a delight . at one point , she gets to sing a snippet from carmen , followed by the final trio of faust ( holding a lapdog , for some strange reason ) , then `` aloha oe '' on the beach ! it 's a surreal comedy -- tremendously entertaining if you can get into the groove .
this has to be one of the most beautiful , moving , thought provoking films around . it 's good family entertainment and at the same time makes you think very hard about the issues involved . every time i see the `` ghost of zac riding the bike through the puddle at the end i ca n't help but cry my eyes out . john thaw 's performance is so touching and it is a shame he is no longer with us . gone but not forgotten . a outstanding film . full marks .
when i first heard that hal hartley was doing a sequel to henry fool , i was excited ( it 's been a personal favorite for years now ) , and then wary when i heard it had something to do with terrorism . having just seen it though , i was surprised to find that it worked , while still being an entirely different sort of movie than henry fool . the writing and direction were both dead on and the acting was superb ... especial kudos go to hartley for reassembling virtually the whole cast , right down to henry 's son , who was only four in the original . like i said though , this movie is quite different from the first , but it works : i reconciled myself with the change in tone and subject matter to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would have found themselves in very different situations since the first film ended . in this case , an unexpected adventure ensues ... and that 's about all i 'll give away ... not to mention the fact that i 'll need to see it again to really understand what 's going on and who 's double crossing who . while it was certainly one of the better movies i 've seen in some time , it suffers like many sequels with its ending , as it appears that hartley is planning a third now and the film leaves you hanging . i 'll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ( 'henry grim ' ? ) in 2017 .
what can i say . oh yeah those freaking fingers are so weird . they scare the heck out of me . but it is such a funny film , jim carrey works the grinch . if you havent already seen it then what you waiting for an invitation . go , go and get watch it . you dont know what your missing .
possibly the best movie ever created in the history of jeffrey combs career , and one that should be looked upon by all talent in hollywood for his versatility , charisma , and uniqueness he brings through his characters and his knowledge of acting .
let me first state that while i have viewed every episode of startrek at least twice , i do not consider myself a trekker or trekkie . those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears . i gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors . the acting was better than average , but the plot held no surprises . they tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation . now as to the historical errors , if you call them that , the first capitan to pilot the enterprise was commander april , then capt . pike , jim kirk , etc .. according to a statement made by both riker and kirk we dicovered the klingons and educated them and gave them the technology ( that 's the reason a prime directive was created ) but like i said these are no reason to discredit this fine series . i hope the plots will get deeper , and then special effects can take a backseat .
mother night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this i was expecting a huge disappointment . instead i got a film that perfectly portrays the irony , humor , elequence , and above all else the crushing sadness of vonnegut 's novel . this is certainly nolte 's best preformance to date . he captures the defeat and selfloathing of howard cambell jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes . alan arkin is absolutly hilarious as george kraft . sherryl lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as cambell 's young lover . john goodman is understated and more than effective as cambell 's `` blue fairy godmother . '' this pinnocioesque story of cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people . and aside from that , it is one of the most deeply romantic films i have ever come across . cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love . and at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion , he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his blue fairy godmother grants him his wish . and he realizes that ... well , watch the movie and you 'll see . mother night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made . it is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author .
this is quite a dull movie . well-shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and art-house connotations all over , it fails because the director takes no position , stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates . one of france 's revered and regular working partner on films with depardieu - i believe they made 7 together - pialat fails to engage . it seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around . isabelle hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like `` i do n't know '' ; `` i like his arms '' ; `` i like the way he makes love '' to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because ... i assume he loves her . so he accepts and hope for what ? that she will one day wake up and come to her senses . things like this are not answered in pialat 's condescending docu-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that do n't add up . i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand . jules et jim , this is not . the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving .
this collection of eleven short stories in one movie is a great idea , and presents some great segments , but also some disappointing surprises . based on the tragic event of the september 11th 2001 in the united states of america , eleven directors were invited to give their approach to the american tragedy . the result of most of them is not only an individual sympathy to the american people , but mainly to the intolerance in the world with different cultures and people . ken loach ( uk ) presents the best segment , about the september 11th 1973 in chile , when the democratic government of salvador alliende was destroyed by the dictator augusto pinochet with the support of the usa . the other excellent segments are the one of youssef chahine ( egypt ) , showing the intolerance in the world , and the number of victims made by usa governments in different countries along the contemporary history ; and the one of mira nair ( india ) , showing a true story of injustice and prejudice against a pakistanis family , whose son was wrongly accused of terrorism in usa , when he was indeed a hero . some segments are beautiful : samira makhmalbaf ( iran ) shows the innocent afghans refugee children preparing an inoffensive shelter against bombs , while their teacher tries to explain to them what happened on the other side of the world ; the romantic claude lelouch ( france ) shows the life of a couple in new york nearby the wtc ; danis tanovic ( bosnia-herzegovina ) shows the effects of their war in a small location and the lonely protest of widows ; sean penn is very poetic , showing that life goes on ; and shohei imamura 's story is probably the most impressive , showing that there is no holy war but sadness and disgrace . the segment of idrissa quedraogo ( birkina faso ) is very naive , but pictures the terrible poor conditions of this african nation . the segment of amos gital ( israel ) is very boring and manipulative , showing more violence and terrorism . the segment of alejandro gonzález iñárritu is very disappointing , horrible , without any inspiration and certainly the worst one . my vote is seven . title ( brazil ) : `` 11 de setembro '' ( `` september 11 '' )
the original vampires ( 1998 ) is one of my favorites . i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters . i was quite surprised at how this played out . as a rule , sequels are never as good as the original , with a few exceptions . though this one was not a great movie , the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact . jon bon jovi was a drawback initially , but he proved to be a half-way decent slayer . i doubt anyone could top james wood 's performance in the first one , though ... unless you bring in buffy ! all in all , this was a decent watch & i would watch it again . i was left with two questions , though ... what happened to jack crow & how did derek bliss come to be a slayer ? guess we 'll just have to leave that to imagination .
another example of the unique talents of cary grant . a performance worthy of oscar consideration , yet once again shunned by the academy . mr. grant runs the gamut from silly to tender in this marvelous comedy about a man who decides to move out of the big city . the pitfalls of building a home are well chronicled and became the basis ( loosely ) for the more modern tom hanks vehicle , `` the money pit '' . if you like good old fashioned comedy without the cursing and the gratuitous sex , this movie is a must see .
if you 're at all interested in pirates , pirate movies , new orleans/early 19th century american history , or yul brynner , see this film for yourself and make up your own mind about it . do n't be put off by various lacklustre reviews . my reaction to it was that it is entertaining , well acted ( for the most part ) , has some very witty dialogue , and that it does an excellent job of portraying the charm , appeal and legendary fascination of the privateer jean lafitte . while not all the events in the film are historically accurate ( can you show me any historical film that succeeds in this ? ) , i feel the film is accurate in its treatment of the role lafitte played in new orleans ' history , and the love-hate relationship between the `` respectable '' citizens of new orleans and this outlaw who was one of the city 's favorite sons . do n't worry about what the film does n't do , but watch it for what it does do , i.e. , for its study of one of new orleans ' , and america 's , most intriguing historical figures .
i thought this was a splendid showcase for mandy 's bodacious bod . if you do n't expect anything else , such as clever plot twists and believable character development , you wo n't be disappointed . consider this a sports illustrated shoot whose character goes around killing people , especially those who threaten to come between her and her 'mommy ' ( suzanna arquette , who obviously does n't want to play the sex kitten - she leaves that up to her daughter ) . mandy 's face is a little too perfect , but her body is a complete 5-alarm fire , up there in the ranks of sophia loren when it comes to natural bustiness , a perfect 7-to-10 ratio of waist to hips , and splendidly configured legs , right down to her feet . ( there has to be some ideal configuration of thighs to knees to calves to ankles that is altogether pleasing to the eye ; mandy certainly is the model for this idealized ratio ) . and no flat butt to boot , which seems to be the undoing of many a busty babe with curves everywhere except in the 'nether hemispheres ' . mandy might have used a body double in the rear shot of her losing her towel as she descended into the candle-lit hot tub with her blindfolded german-guy victim no . 2 , but from all i could see from her bikini shots , she had the butt for it and did n't need a double to prove it . mandy 's acting abilities had little to do with her impression of a psychotic 'mommy 's girl ' , with the obvious erotic lesbian overtones . her bisexual nature ( allowing herself to be boinked in the hot tub after a long flirtation with german guy no . 2 , who also happened to be her mother 's lover ) added an additional dimension to an otherwise one-dimensional caricature of adolescent female horniness conflicted with pathological murderous impulses ( always by water with the men - the ultimate fate of the latina housekeeper was edited out in the televised version for some obscure reason ) . mandy 's uber-nordic facial features coupled with her uber-voluptuous body could either be a blessing or a curse . if mandy really wants to further her career as an actress , i 'd advise her to immerse herself fully in the romance languages , especially italian and spanish - and maybe french , although i do n't know if they would go for her type . but this would enable her to reconcile her bo derek face with her vida guerra body - but maybe her face is just a little too nordic , and she has shown off too much of her extraordinary body in a cheesy movie to enable her to advance to any more fame that was enjoyed by michelle johnson of the 1980 's whose early fame in blame it on rio was followed by a series of skin flicks that failed to make it off the ground . vambo drule .
this is the story of australian commandos who are captured out of uniform after a raid . since they are out of uniform , they are , justly , treated as spies . as such , they are tried , convicted , and sentenced to death . the japanese court-martial , out of admiration for their heroism , authorizes that they be given a warrior 's death . of course , under the code of bushido , this means that they are to be beheaded . a fate for which , as westerners , they are unprepared .
the feel of this movie was amazing . adam sandler 's performance was very inspiring . as he played a very rattled and fragile character , he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role . his character was really interesting . i can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as sandler made me . for someone who plays primarily comedy roles , he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input . i especially loved the scene in which adam and don 's characters rode the motorized scooter around the city . i familiarized with the moment , because it seemed like don was witnessing one thing adam does to get away from it all . with his video games , music , and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past , riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts . this movie is definitely worth the watch .
this is a great movie for all ages . its the story about three animals how have to find their way home . there is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie . you never know what is going to happen next . this movie makes you cry and makes you laugh . you just do n't know what going to happen next . the trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes . they producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too . the animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors/actress themselves . everything about this movie is great ! 10 out of 10 the whole way ! rent or buy it today i can guarantee you will love it the whole family will !
definitely needed a little work in season 2 . such as the virus between max and logan , and ames white along with his ancient , super cult . during season two , however , the only thing that kept me watching was to see if max and logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus infecting max . very good drama in season two . but of course like all tv shows , if there 's something a little wrong with it , the broadcasting company takes it off the air . i was seriously hoping for a third and final season . season 2 leaves you hanging , unless you read the books by max allan collins , then you will know what happens . dark angel should be put back on the air for one more season even though it might cost a lot just to get all the original actors again . since jessica alba 's carrier sky rocketed after the show . if that would be the case , then there should be a movie to complete it . just like the show firefly , which of course fox canceled as well .
i grew up watching this movie , and i still love it just as much today as when i was a kid . do n't listen to the critic reviews . they are not accurate on this film.eddie murphy really shines in his roll.you can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it.i recommend this movie to everybody to see . it is a comedy with a touch of fantasy.with demons , dragons , and a little bald kid with god like powers.this movie takes you from l.a. to tibet , of into the amazing view of the wondrous temples of the mountains in tibet.just a beautiful view ! so go do your self a favor and snatch this one up ! you wont regret it !
let us begin by saying that this film 's english title `` the power of kangwon province '' is an absolute misnomer.it is because in hong sang soo 's film , there are no actual shots of wars , troubles and conflicts.so the idea of establishing power of a province is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film.if we were to judge this film by its korean language title , '' kangwon-do ui him '' is going to appear as a cryptic statement about emotional turmoils of its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest.hong sang soo has also directed a highly prolific visual document about erratic choices made by people in their lives.the people in question are a couple of young girls who are constantly in the process of displaying their moods , whims and fancies . if making a film out of nothingness can be claimed as a film maker 's meritorious virtue then hong sang soo has to be saluted as a courageous film maker whose films speak volumes about ubiquitous nothingness of human relationships , sentiments and lives.whether one likes it or not , this is the only fair conclusion that be deduced from this particular film .
this movie is probably for you . it had an overall meditative quality from the music , to the beautiful photography , and listening to the often cliché things about life that andy goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots . if you 're familiar with buddhism- that is the sort of the sense i got out of this film . the impermanence of life , the beauty of nature , the interconnectedness of all things , etc . however , what i did not understand , confused , and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing ( i saw over an hour of it ) was the redundancy of the whole thing . you only find out bits and pieces of why he 's commissioned , and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work . the art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends .
tripping over . i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes , but having faith in the show , and abe forsythe 's unquestionable talent , i continued to watch . i can safely say i 'm now glad that i did . the story did develop quite well , and all the characters have a strong base , and most do n't have any information missing . the only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character lizzie . some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line . here 's to hoping for another season !
the unflappable william powell . he is a joy to watch on the screen as he makes his way through situations without a care in the world . he always seems on top of his game and shows little care for anyone who doubts him . the murders are projects , barely human beings . i have noticed this is a staple of the whodunnit . other than an occasional weeping widow , the victims fulfill the function of being the reason the movie exists . nothing more . there are enough twists and turns to keep things interesting along the way and powell is a master at this . there is a lot of political incorrectness , especially as it relates to the asian performers . this is a little hard to take . the cast is great , and curtiz 's direction is also a consistent asset .
i love this movie because i grew up around harness racing . pat boone behind the sulky reminds me of my father who was drawn to the trotters because , unlike thoroughbred jockeys , men of normal height and weight can be drivers . yes , the 1944 home in indiana is a better movie , but it 's also a very different movie . april love is light and easy to watch , a feel good movie . ( disappointing though that pat boone 's religious/moral views prohibited him from ever kissing the girl ! quite a change from today 's standard fare . ) home in indiana with walter brennan ( filmed in black and white with no hint that anyone will ever burst into song ) captures the stress and struggle better thereby making the ultimate accomplishment more satisfying but it requires a bigger emotional investment .
aside from the great movie metropolis , this is about the oldest pure sci-fi movie . while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad , it is a great film for two reasons . first , it is extremely original in both style and content . even in the 21st century , there are no films i can think of that are anything like it . second , for its time , the special effects were absolutely incredible -- using matte paintings , models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow . sure , you could sit back and knock the film because , by today 's standards , the effects are only so-so . but , you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences . in many ways , the sets look highly reminiscent of the `` modern cities '' featured at the 1939 world 's fair . i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question `` are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness ? '' the end result seems to be a little of both ! how true ! a final note : i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video . all three times the sound and print quality stank -- particularly the sound . if this is available on a dvd , hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning . as the sound on the video kept cutting out , i really would have appreciated this !
i watched the pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is `` original . '' it is a word not used much in tv as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows , unfunny comedies , and reality crap . the first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of jim dale . those not familiar with the british `` carry on ... '' series or those who have not listened to a harry potter book , may not be familiar with dale . i am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distracts . i will have to tune in more , but it does give the show a `` harry potter '' atmosphere . maybe that 's a good thing . lee pace ( infamous , the white countess ) has a gift . it never explains where he got it , but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute . he teams with chi mcbride ( `` boston public , '' roll bounce ) to solve murders using this talent . everything is fine and funny until he comes across a childhood love , anna friel ( goal ! the dream begins , timeline ) and things really get complicated . he ca n't send her back and he can never touch her . boy , would that make a relationship difficult . i will be tuning in to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to entertain .
elmer fudd is laughing while lounging in his easy chair and reading his comic book , his dog comfortably nearby sleeping in front of the fireplace . all is peaceful until a flea comes bouncing by . ( the flea is dressed in a farmer's-type outfit with a big sombrero and is carrying a satchel with the name `` a. flea '' on it . ) he gets out his telescope and spots the dog . ( we see a big shot of the dog 's butt and the flea whistles in excitement , screaming `` t- bone ! '' he then sings , `` there 's food around the corner ; there 's food around the corner ! '' ) that sets up the storyline of this cute-but-obnoxious flea tormenting the poor dog . the mutt is hilarious as he reacts to the flea . the drawings of his huge teeth chomping right next to the fleeing flea are clever and the dog 's dialog made me laugh out loud a few times . this might be the funniest canine i have ever seen in a cartoon ! the poor pooch , under a threat of having to take a bath , as to not react when the stupid flea causes him pain . it 's almost painful to watch as the flea uses pickaxes , jackhammers and the like on the dog . he puts firecrackers in the dog 's behind . it 's brutal !
okay , so the plot is on shaky ground . yeah , all right , so there are some randomly inserted song and/or dance sequences ( for example : adam 's concert and henri 's stage act ) . and leslie caron ca n't really , um , you know ... act . but somehow , 'an american in paris ' manages to come through it all as a polished , first-rate musical -- largely on the basis of gene kelly 's incredible dancing talent and choreography , and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with caron . ( he needs to , because she seems to have a ... problem with emoting . ) the most accomplished and technically awe-inspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16-minute ballet towards the end of the film . it 's stunningly filmed , and kelly and caron dance beautifully . but my favourite number would have to be kelly 's character singing ' i got rhythm ' with a bunch of french school-children , then breaking into an array of american dances . it just goes to prove how you do n't need special effects when you 've got some real * talent * . not on the 'classics ' level with 'singin ' in the rain ' , but pretty high up there nonetheless . worth the watch !
being the first feature film with robert de niro ( although not released for years later ) , this is worth the watch . de niro 's role is n't huge , yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it . any die hard de niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today .
being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb . it 's your basic 'who done it ? ' thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end . i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standard . to me it was worth watching more than once so i 'll give it an 8 on imdb .
when i was a kid i watched this many times over , and i remember whistling the `` happy cat '' song quite often . all the songs are great , and actually memorable , unlike many children 's musicals , where the songs are just stuck in for no real reason . the scenes and costumes are lavish , and the acting is very well-done , which is n't surprising , considering the cast . christopher walken is very catlike , and does n't need stupid make-up , or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he 's a cat transformed to a human . and jason connery 's so cute , as the shy and awkward miller 's son , corin , who falls in love with beautiful and the bold princess vera . this is a really fun , enjoyable , feature-length movie , where unlike most fairytales , the characters are given personalities . some of my favourite parts are when puss makes corin pretend he 's drowning ; at the ball when everybody starts dancing a country dance , as it 's `` all the rage abroad '' ; when walken is in the kitchen , dancing on the table ( he 's a pretty good dancer , too ! ) ; and when vera tells corin all the things she used to do when she was young , like pretending she was a miller 's daughter . i 'd recommend this film to children and parents alike , who love magic and fairytales . and it actually is a movie you can watch together , as it wo n't drive adults up the wall .
after his classic film noir homage chinatown roman polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror which , like repulsion and rosemary 's baby , deals with the paranoia and claustrophobia generated by apartment living . claustrophobic environments are the ones which polanski is best at creating , and this has to be the most suffocating and confined picture he ever created . the emphasis on side walls and distant vanishing points is greater than ever , and even in the small number of exterior scenes the sky is rarely glimpsed . but the tenant is not just confined spatially , but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist . trelkovsky , played by polanski himself is not only in every scene , he is in virtually every shot . when he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes trelkovsky 's point of view . and of course almost everywhere he looks he sees his own reflection staring back at him in a mirror . i ca n't think of any film that is more about the internalisation and solitude of one character . some psychological thrillers , like m or peeping tom , manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist . others , like psycho , attempt in-depth scientific analysis of his mental condition . the tenant fits into neither of these categories  it simply immerses us completely inside trelkovsky 's experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head . we feel his paranoia and obsession even though it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrational . polanski was also a master of the slowly unfolding horror film . often in his horrors there is an ambiguity as to whether there is actually anything sinister going on , but they are among the most effective at frightening audiences . why ? precisely because they unfold so slowly and invest so much time in painstakingly setting up situations that they immerse the viewer in paranoia . a much later polanski horror , the ninth gate is a bit of a mess plot-wise but at least it still manages to achieve that creeping sense of dread . this is a rare chance to see polanski himself in a major role . his talent in front of the camera was as good as behind it , and he is absolutely perfect as the meek trelkovsky . another standout performance is that of the all-too-often overlooked shelley winters as the concierge . in actual fact it is rather a stellar cast , although many of the familiar faces look out of place in this strange , gothic european movie . also sadly many of the french actors in supporting roles are atrociously dubbed in the english language version . the tenant is more polished and less pretentious than repulsion , but it lacks the suspense and the character that make rosemary 's baby so engrossing and entertaining . the tenant is good , with no major flaws , and polanski was really on top form as a director , but it 's not among his most gripping works .
robert standish 's novel is about a triangular romantic situation on a ceylonese tea plantation ... so the events of the ceylon backgrounds and pictorial beauty are rewarding points to william dieterle 's film ... the story is about a rich powerful planter ( peter finch ) , who brings a charming and tender beauty ( elizabeth taylor ) , into the jungle as his bride ... the plantation , of course , is endangered by some kind of wild life ... for this reason taylor  elegant as never in dazzling costumes  finds herself in a strange atmosphere ... the echo determination of a ghost , the bad temper of a husband obsessed by the memory of his autocratic father , a highly dangerous disease , and the fury of wild animals ... in her confusion , boredom and annoyance elizabeth taylor looks to a friendly face , a pretentious foreman ( dana andrews ) , who admires her beauty but tries to conquer her love ... with echoes of `` jane eyre , '' the mysterious yorkshire mansion with a brooding master , and `` rebecca , '' the innocent young second wife hunted by the image of the glamorous first wife , `` elephant walk '' is a menace melodrama with a wide view of a huge tropical bungalow , exotic dances with rage excessively colorful , stampeding big bull elephants , amazing mansion set on fire , all in the company of an exquisite creature with an unquestioned beauty and talent ... the movie gave liz a change of scenery , and allowed her more creative energy and self-respect than most of her other willful debutante-rebels the wife here has a sharp tongue and a strong will , and so taylor plays her movie star heroine with more spirit than she was given credit for
although this movie has some weaknesses , it is worth seeing . i chose it because of the cast , and applaud bonham carter and branagh for choosing roles different from those they have taken in the past . both portray very troubled people , complete with warts , but make them likeable because of their humanity . the story is touching , but it is the performances that soar . bonham carter 's `` jane '' is a remarkable achievement , whose quest for romance opened my eyes to aspects of being disabled that i had not thought of before , but was interesting as well for other reasons . i felt the movie ended too abruptly , but better that than a drawn out emotionally manipulative ending ( see `` stepmom . '' ) the very real english setting added to my enjoyment - it was england in the 90 's , both urban and rural , without being depressing .
bertrand blier is indeed l'enfant terrible of french cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public . filmed with his fave duo ( depardieu and dewaere ) and the usual dose of sex ( miou-miou plays her typical role , at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best french actress ever ) . in first `` les valseuses '' is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals . those who only are satisfied with family life , or simply know nothing more , the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that , it just let you think of all the usual things in life ( working for the car , being bounded at work etc. ) . it 's a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we 're living in . great job and it just makes you wish two things : dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course depardieu , he 'd better should have stuck with french movies as he proves here that no one can beat him . timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some ...
an interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger , a sloth , and a mammoth , who saved a baby , who was close to be killed by a group of tigers during the ice age . the morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end . one of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby , who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community . the baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth , but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby . they went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger , and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth . at the end the group of tigers tried to capture the baby but the mammoth helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs .
i ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a sunday afternoon . though it was obviously a cheesy tv movie from the 70s , the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention , and indeed i was hooked and had to watch it through to the end . i recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign dvd of this film ( oops , did n't notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior ) , and was very pleased to be able to watch it again ( and in its entirety ) . i do n't wholly understand the phenomenon , but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary . the decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons , but are they actually scary ? no , not very . likewise in the years since the 70s we 've gotten horror movies that are cooler , more exciting , have much better production values and sophisticated special effects , are more fun , funnier , have effective `` jump '' moments , and some very creative uses of gore , but again ... they are n't really scary ! there 's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films . the grainy film quality . the spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high-tech lighting rigs . the `` edge of dreamland '' muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently eq 'd scores . the odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything . everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s , in the case of horror , works in its favor . specifically , in this film , the quiet , intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving . so much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling , slavering , and overtly hostile ( `` cujo '' ? ) . the filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full-on supernatural form . the effects when that occurs , while unsophisticated by today 's standards , literally gave me chills . the bizarre , vaguely-defined , `` i 'm not quite sure what i 'm looking at '' look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be , rather than the hyper-real , crystal clear optical printer / digital compositor confections of latter-day horror films . while the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit , the actors all do a decent job . the pairing of the brother and sister from the `` witch mountain '' movies as , yes , brother and sister , is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting , but they do fine . yvette mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular . richard crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses . his self-doubt as he wonders whether his family 's alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he 's merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled , though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he 's been experiencing is absurd in its naïveté . the movie 's the-end-question-mark type ending is one of the only ones i 've seen that does n't feel like a cheap gimmick , and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they 'd be likely to do and how they 'd feel about it . detractors of this film may say it 's merely a feature-length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots , but hey , you could say the same thing about `` blade runner '' . : - )
the great and underrated marion davies shows her stuff in this late ( 1928 ) silent comedy that also showcases the wonderful william haines . davies plays a hick from georgia who crashes hollywood with help from haines . they appear in cheap comedies until marion is `` discovered '' and becomes a big dramatic star . a great lampoon on hollywood and its pretentions . davies & haines are a wonderful team ( too bad they never made a talkie together ) and the guest shots from the likes of charlie chaplin , douglas fairbanks , william s. hart , john gilbert , elinor glynn , and marion davies ( you have to see it ) are a hoot . a must for any serious film buff or for anyone interested in the still-maligned marion davies !
this is such a fantastic movie , a western about a self-concerned man ( jimmy stewart ) going up to the klondike for gold . on the way , he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska ( john mcintire , giving a wonderfully evil performance ) , whom he hassles back . mcintire threatens that he 'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town , which is , unfortunately , the only way back to the states . the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintire 's town . ruth roman , for instance , who has come with stewart and his two companions ( jay c. flippen and walter brennen , who plays stewart 's best friend ) , builds a saloon ( a hollywood front for a whorehouse ) and tries to run the town 's restaurant and hang-out place out of business . she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up , too . in 1953 , jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre , the naked spur . the far country is just the tiniest bit less , and it contains 99.9 % of what made that film so special without , of course , feeling like a cheap copy . like the naked spur , the far country boasts beautiful , on-location cinematography . the landscape is gorgeous . stewart gives one of his best performances ( nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954 , rear window ) . i suppose it could be considered cliche , as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end . still , stewart plays it so damn well , he makes this character very human . and the supporting performances are universally fantastic . in addition to those i 've mentioned , the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good . and i ought to single out walter brennen , as well . he seems to have specialized in playing best friends . his relationship with stewart is very touching , since he is , at first , the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man . the screenplay is very well written , and mann 's direction is impeccable . a masterpiece . 10/10 .
when i started watching the show i said `` oh , no ! it 's as corny as elfen lied and not even that bloody ! '' . and indeed , the setup is almost identical , with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself , then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him . but this is where the resemblance stops . the love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in inuiyasha , while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few . the magical setup is a bit corny , because it 's about seven people , with seven servants , fighting for the holy grail , all servants being someone famous , half of all masters being from the same school , rules of engagement , etc . however , this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script . i actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and , without comparing it with animes that i liked more , but were from other genres , i have to say that i was very pleased .
the italian is an astonishingly accomplished film for its time . stunningly shot , with lighting effects that are truly sublime , this is an early gem that clearly reveals reginald barker to be a pioneer director of equal standing to d.w. griffith and maurice tourneur . how much control thomas ince exerted over the production is hard to know , but this film still has extraordinary power . the simple story of an italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in new york , is very moving . the themes of social injustice , revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today . the use of close-ups is outstanding and the powerhouse performance of george beban is electrifying . what we need now is a really good print transferred to dvd so we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema .
there is no denying that ealing comedies are good , but for me this film stands out as one of the best . the basic premise of the film is that a small part of pimlico in london is discovered to be part of burgundy , not the uk . we then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes , and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from uk law , rationing does not exist . when they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system . they are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right . in fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started , that 's where the moral comes in . it 's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender , only to have the whole of london respond to their plight by sending food , lot 's of it . thus enabling them to continue their struggle . this film hit 's the right note throughout , the acting is superb , with stanley holloway , margaret rutherford , hermione baddeley and betty warren standing out . it 's pitched just right , not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat . well worth a viewing
beautifully done . a lot of angst . friendship may not endure all , but in the end it 's all that matters , or so a group of friends learn . i have watched it over and over again . the music is also amazing . when kei loses the one friend he has he gives up until he meets sho , an orphan boy who is not repelled by his true nature . in the lawless streets of mallepa they struggle for their own place among a melting pot of asian races , and learn that sometimes being on top can cost you more than you are ever ready to pay . a surprise ending that grips as much as the whole movie does . i could n't get enough of it . gackt and hyde do a wonderful job of acting , proving they are more than pretty boys who sing .
laurence olivier , merle oberon , ralph richardson , and binnie barnes star in `` the divorce of lady x , '' a 1938 comedy based on a play . olivier plays a young barrister , everard logan who allows oberon to spend the night in his hotel room , when the london fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home . the next day , a friend of his , lord mere ( richardson ) , announces that his wife ( barnes ) spent the night with another man at the same hotel , and he wants to divorce her . believing the woman to be oberon , olivier panics . oberon , who is single and the granddaughter of a judge , pretends that she 's the lady in question , lady mere , when she 's really leslie steele . we 've seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time . with this cast , it 's delightful . i mean , richardson and olivier ? olivier and oberon , that great team in wuthering heights ? pretty special . olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight , nervous barrister . oberon gives her role the right light touch . she looks extremely young here , fuller in the face , with jean harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her . she wears some beautiful street clothes , though her first gown looks like a birthday cake , and in one gown she tries on , with that hair-do , she 's ready to play snow white . binnie barnes is delightful as the real lady mere . the color in this is a mess , and as others have mentioned , it could really use a restoration . definitely worth seeing .
a remarkable piece of documentary , giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself ( for further evidence , check out some of the comments on imdb ... ! ) . compares extremely favourably with oliver stone 's `` comandante '' ( which is mainly an in-depth examination of fidel castro 's nostril hairs ) . i do n't know whether chavez is everything he presents himself as being , or yet another in the long line of populist latin-american `` caudillos '' . nor do i know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of venezuelans . it 's hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but i 've certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of what 's at stake , and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup . someone says in the film `` we 're making history '' , and that 's exactly what the film feels like it 's capturing . outstanding stuff .
cinematography -- compared to 'the wrestler , ' a degree of verite and cinematic skill that disarms the viewer , and then hypnotizes as well . acting -- the dialogue is minimal , but the pauses and silence poignant . story -- the conflict in a 'balkanized ' denmark is volatile , as we saw recently jihad murders in the netherlands and riots in france . while i harbor no love for islam , the departure from the west from christian values holds no cause for celebration . the director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither , emphasizing the development of aicha as an individual who became a champion , not so much in the ring , but to all those around her . even her worst . . . i will stop here to avoid the spoiler .
how does an usual day start in point place , wisconsin ... first of all , red , the tyrannical father of the forman family and a wwii veteran , sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife kitty serves breakfast . then comes their skinny son , eric , he sits at the table as well , and his father starts his daily yelling , usually involving placing his foot in eric 's behind if ( insert reason here ) . if his promiscuous angel-faced sister laurie is at home , she comes along , then red stops yelling and kindly talks to her , making eric feel left out of the family . once this daily ( painful ) ritual is over , eric rushes down to his basement , where all his friends are already hanging out . and when we get to see them , it becomes obvious eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend , next-door neighbor and childhood friend donna pinciotti are the sanest people around . meet steven hyde , the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and does n't really care about what 's around as long as it 's not funny to watch ; michael kelso , the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through his life only by his looks and that carrots grow in trees ; jackie burkhardt , the one who thinks of herself as the prettiest girl around , spoiled kid of a rich father , and , of course , cheerleader ; and fez , a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and ca n't keep a secret . at first they simply hang out , gossiping and making fun of kelso , but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin ... before going out doing something they 'll regret later . meanwhile red goes out and meets donna 's weirdo parents , bob and midge . he 's rude , but they do n't mind , as they think he 's joking . somewhere around is leo , an aging hippie , who 's constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing . did you imagine that seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters ? of course , most seem `` clichéd '' , but the show takes the cliché to a new level . now throw in some of the most wicked story lines a sitcom can offer , sit down and enjoy one of the best tv shows ever . the one that never does two times the same thing and which is , compared to most sitcoms that are `` cute funny '' , purely hysterical . if you get hooked , do n't let this show let you go . bite on the hook over and over and , man , you will see the sitcom genre from a whole new prospective .
i thought this was a very good movie . it would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off . i 'm sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending , that 's why this made this move such a good movie . it shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it 's 2 sisters dealing with a boy , ( the same boy ) that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them . it 's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone 's life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over . i really enjoyed watching this movie , and i still do now when it comes on . i seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on . it would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie , maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby , this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died , this way it would keep him alive even though he 's dead .
the movie is far more sophisticated and intelligent is its exploration of sexual tension than such american attempts as 9 and a half weeks ... the courtroom scene itself ... with the couple copulating in the cage while the heroine pleads for their orgasm ... is amazing ... i have not seen this movie in 20 years ... but it made indelible pictures in my mind ... it is rich in texture and successful in creating a world where sex is the engine for all activity , and at its bottom is the yawning angst that lives in us all .... the plot is european , and it meanders a bit , but so does life ... especially when you are 17 and have a constant hard on ....
so many educational films are nothing more than mind-numbing drudgery , saved only by the fact that `` mst3k '' mocks them ( `` why study industrial arts ? '' comes to mind ) . `` hemo the magnificent '' is actually quite well done . it 's all about blood , the heart , and the circulatory system . i admit that i do n't remember everything from it , but it does a good job explaining everything , keeping it serious but entertaining . i guess that you can always count on june foray ( most famously the voice of rocky the squirrel , she plays a deer here ) . since `` hemo the magnificent '' itself may be hard to find , probably the best place to see it is in `` gremlins '' : a class is watching it while a gremlin is forming .
the plot of this film might not be extraordinary , but what makes the film really special , are its characters ( and the actors who play them  of course ! ) . i wo n't go into the details of the plot of the movie , but i would certainly like to say this  this film is not just for everyone ! the film is really witty and you need to be equally clever to get all the satire . if you 're not alert even for a second , you 'll probably end up missing one of the subtle points . the movie is full of such seemingly trivial but witty stuff - like the announcements going on in the background at turaqistan , the advertisements on the tankers ( which i almost missed ) and it are these that make the movie hilarious throughout . coming to the actors , john cusack has played his multi-faceted role very efficiently ( what with him being the co-writer and the producer too ) and he plays his character  hauser , the killer with a heart  exquisitely . cusack 's done a similar kind of role before in grosse pointe blank , but his comic disposition in the movie is simply superb . however the actress who steals all the show is hilary duff ! i have always been a huge fan of ms. duff . but to be honest i was a bit disappointed when i heard about the kind of role she 's playing in the movie . but after watching the movie the disappointment gave way to great respect for her as an actor . let 's face it ! the kid 's growing , but yes , so is her talent ! all those critics , who shouted hoarse that hilary can not act , will be silent for a while . hilary had to play a really complex character  tough on the outside , yet a sweet child on the inside  and she 's done complete justice to it . she makes you laugh , and she makes you cry  to cut the long story short ( 'cause i could go on raving about her for ever ) she 's brilliant ! marisa tomei and joan cusack have done a good job too . especially , joan 's hysterics are uproarious ! however , i was rather disappointed with ben kingsley being wasted in such a small role and his performance seemed lackluster . in general war , inc. keeps you on your toes throughout with its intelligent humor , and ends with just the right amount of twists in the plot . i would highly recommend this movie to all ( and more so to hilary duff fans ) ! ! ! p.s . - i am really glad to hear the movie is going to break free of its limited release and release at other places soon ! ! !
( there is n't much in the way of spoilers , since there is n't a plot to reveal , but still , i guess i describe some of what happens so ... ) this is it . this is the most nonsensical film i 've ever seen . there are simply no words to describe this movie , although `` bizarre '' `` ridiculous '' and `` ego trip '' are pretty close . the opening half hour or so are really , really weird music videos , with absolutely no plot or continuity , apart from that mj falls into some from the previous . one of the highlights of this part of the `` film '' in the section where mj is flying a merry-go-round aeroplane through what seem to be half-arsed bond intro rejects and sections cut from yellow submarine ( dear lord you could not make this up ) . then , with a little over an hour remaining , the `` film '' begins , with a lot of claymation ( some of it really creepy ) spotting our `` hero '' and chasing him looking for an autograph . obviously , this leaves our as of yet mute ( discounting songs ) lead somewhat worried , and he manages to temporarily lose them . fortunate for him , because it means he can witness a falling star and , and again , i 'm not making this up , turn into a claymation rabbit . he uses this cunning disguise to try and sneak past them , but , for reasons i ca n't recall right now , they see through it ( oh no ! ) and the creepy chase begins again . cue another song ( big shock there ) . shortly after the end of the chase , mj somehow brings the rabbit to life , until he is busted by a policeman ( in the middle of the desert ) because it is , apparently , illegal to dance there . the rest of the film is equally as strange , highlights including mj cleaning up a bar to the tune of smooth criminal , including shooting a man with his finger , not only killing the guy , but burning his shadow into the wall , a la nuclear fission weapons . another good moment is when mj , seeing , mr big ( joe `` what the hell happened to his career at this point ? '' peschi ) kidnap one of the children he was friends with , magically creates a tommy gun , and in another moment of violence that pepper this film seemingly at random , opens fire at everything that moves . a final moment i shall mention is when mj , surrounded by mr big and his private army . seriously , this guy has dozens of people working for him , and they 're decked out more like commando units rather than mobsters , which i guess they are . how does he get out ? why , he turns into a robot , complete with weapons and shield . this is the third of four transformations he makes , almost always when backed into a corner and/or on the run . this film is quite , quite surreal , with little in the way of plot , and virtually no continuity .
many of the american people would say ... what ? ? ? to my opening comment . yes i know that my comparison is without doubts an insult for the fans of the master akira kurosawa , but if you analyze this movie , my comment is right . we have the peasant who goes to the town searching for help against a band of grasshoppers who wants to steal the harvest of the village . the great difference is the way that the story takes . our samurais , a band of circus performers as in the original are a very complex mixture of personalities but at the end are what the village needs , heroes . please watch again this incredible movie ( the seven samurai , obviously ) and find another movies who has stolen the story and tried to get the same magic effect than the masterpiece of akira kurosawa . a tip is the 13th warrior with antonio banderas , michael crichton copied the story to wrote his best seller 's , but he did n't found the third foot of the cat .
when i first saw this film on cable , it instantly became one of my favorite movies . i 'm a big fan of james earl jones and robert duvall . the movie paints an accurate picture of the south and the racist attitudes . most of the attitudes came from soll , an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor . soll is what makes the move , his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way the south was back then . i suppose that if soll lived today he would be diagnosed with alzheimer 's disease . none the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex . while he has racist views , he 's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black . the two convicts he trusts most are jackson ( mel winkler ) and ben ( james earl jones ) . the conversations between ben and soll are the best in the movie , they have real chemistry . james earl jones and mel winkler both but in great performances as well as hass . this movie should have gotten more notoriety . however it 's on dvd and worth the money . rayvyn
this is probably my favorite movie of all time . it is perfection in its storytelling . it will break your heart not because it 's over sentimental but because you will truly feel every emotion these characters go through . you feel for doggie because of the hopeless situation that existed for young girls in china at that time .
this is the neil simon piece of work that got a lot of praises ! `` the odd couple '' is a one of a kind gem that lingers within . you got felix ungar ( jack lemmon ) ; a hypochondriac , fussy neat-freak , and a big thorn in the side of his roommate , oscar madison ( walter matthau ) ; a total slob . these men have great jobs though . felix is a news writer , and oscar is a sports writer . both of these men are divorced , felix 's wife is nearby , while oscar 's is on the other side of the u.s. ( the west coast ) . well , what can you say ? two men living in one roof together without driving each other crazy , is impossible as well as improbable . it 's a whole lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun . i liked the part where when those two british neighbors that speak to both gentlemen , and after oscar kicked out felix , he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier . it 's about time that felix needed to lighten up . i guess all neat-freaks neat to lighten up . they can be fussy , yet they should be patient as well . a very fun movie , and a nuevo classic . neil simon 's `` the odd couple '' is a must see classic movie . 5 stars !
the original title means `` the birth of the octopuses '' . i must confess that i do not quite understand this title . the english title is `` water lilies '' . but after having written this , i read the comment by another user : `` the title in french is also suggestive : `` prieuve '' , or octopus , suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously . '' thanks for your explanation . the basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls , when it is not clear if they are directed toward the same or the other sex . it is no different for boys . i think that both floriane and marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any admixtures . much of the movie is water ballet . sometimes the girls will have their heads downwards , and nothing above the water except their feet and lowers legs , with which they will wave and kick in the air . to people like me who had never seen such things before , it was fascinating . - floriane is the leader of one team of `` water lilies '' . marie tells her that she would like to see when floriane is training . this seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary . soon they will walk together . floriane takes marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her , and then goes away with him for an hour , while marie is waiting for her to return . i took for granted that the couple slept with each other . but we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that . i can supply some information which few users will find elsewhere . there is a scene in which marie secretly steals floriane 's garbage bag . in it she finds an apple , mostly eaten . and marie proceeds to eat the rest .  there is a parallel scene in another movie , `` kazetachi no gogo '' ( afternoon breezes ) by hitoshi yazaki ( japan , 1980 ) . this is about adult young females , and a clearly lesbian woman is vainly in love with a heterosexual woman . she also steals a garbage bag of the beloved , and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest . later floriane tells marie that she would like to have her first orgasm from her . marie says she can not do this . but still later marie says that she is indeed willing to do it . and she masturbates on floriane . there is no nudity in this scene . probably only a female director could have made such a fine psychological show or study of  i would like to quote baudelaire , `` les amours enfantines '' . floriane is played by adèle haenel , who made the excellent performance as the autistic girl in `` the little devils '' by christophe ruggia ( 2002 )  a very underrated movie .
tears of kali is an original yet flawed horror film that delves into the doings of a cult group in india comprised of german psychologists who have learned how to control their wills and their bodies to the point that they can cause others to be `` healed '' through radical techniques ( that can trigger nightmarish hallucinations and physical pain and torture ) to release the pent-up demons inside them . the film is shown as a series of vignettes about the taylor-eriksson group -- the above-mentioned cult group . the first segment is somewhat slower than the rest but serves fine to set up the premise for the rest of the film . the rest of it plays out like a mindf @ ck film with some of the key staples thrown in the mix ( full-frontal nudity , some gore ) to keep you happy . i say check this out . may not be spectacular , but it 's concept is pretty neato and it delivers in the right spots . 8/10 .
a woman left alone after the death of her husband finds herself attracted to her son 's friend and handy man . in a slightly twisted story , the woman begins sleeping with the handy man in an effort to revive herself . the twisted part ? the handy man is also her daughter 's on and off love interest . as if this was n't strange enough , the mother manages to fall for this man and when her daughter finds out , she blames not only her dysfunctional relationship but also her messed up life on her poor mother . though you may think badly of this woman , the truth is movie manages to portray her in a positive light . beautifully played by anne reid , this character has dimension and portrays great emotion . a truly brilliant performance and an enjoyable film . 8/10
'they all laughed ' is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves , and why ? their are many reasons the fact that it 's set in new york which truly sets the tone , the fantastic soundtrack , the appealing star turns from ben gazzara , and the late john ritter who is superb . and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn . the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties , film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak ( the films co-producer ) and john ritter , basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate 's wife ( hepburn ) and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production , 'they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans .
i 'm biased towards any movie that paints a luxuriant picture of italy - in my opinion the most romantic country in the world . unfortunately the movie was rather short , unusually so for a period piece , and a little sparse on the cinematography aspect . however , the excellent story makes up for it . the four ladies embark on a much-needed relaxing vacation with problems on their minds . over the course of the movie , they realize their problems and begin fixing them . they believe san salvatore , the castle they stay in , has an enchanting effect on people . `` it 's a tub of love , '' says lottie wilkins . you can watch their gradual change from dissatisfied to exuberant as the italian seaside works its magic on them . all their problems and their solutions are plausible . the actresses were great . the background music seemed very appropriate for an romantic italian locale . all in all , a 10/10 movie for me .
i went into deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller ; and while that 's something like what this film is ; i also ca n't help but think that it 's just a poor man 's sleuth . the classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film ; not particularly in terms of the plot , but certainly it 's the case with the execution . the casting of michael caine in the central role just confirms it . the film is based on a play by ira levin ( who previously wrote rosemary 's baby and the stepford wives ) and focuses on sidney bruhl ; a playwright whose best days are behind him . after his latest play bombs , sidney finds himself at a low ; and this is not helped when a play named deathtrap ; written by an amateur he taught , arrives on his doorstep . deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success , and sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own ; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe , killing him , and then passing deathtrap off as his own work . despite all of its clever twists and turns ; deathtrap falls down on one primary element , and that 's the characters . the film fails to provide a single likable character , and it 's very hard to care about the story when you 're not rooting for any of the players . this is not helped by the acting . michael caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect , but nobody else does themselves proud . christopher reeve is awkward in his role , while dyan cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance . it 's lucky then that the story is good ; and it is just about good enough to save the film . the plot features plenty of twists and turns ; some work better than others , but there 's always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting . director sidney lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus . the central location is interesting in its own right , and the cinematography fits the film well . overall , i have to admit that i did enjoy this film ; but it could have been much , much better .
fascinating look at fascist italy and the people who carved out a life under mussolini . street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching . combine this with a masterful plot and premier acting and you get a film that you will want to watch again . .. and maybe again .
this movie is one i strongly recommend . it 's about a boy , stanley yelnats ( shia lebeouf ) who is wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to camp green lake , a boys ' detention center . there , he is forced to dig holes 5 feet deep and 5 feet in diamiter . while there , he meets the other boys of the camp ( zero , magnet , armpit , squid , x-ray , and zigzag ) . all of them are digging , not to 'build charactor ' , but to find outlaw kate barlow 's treasure . throughout the movie ( and book ) stanley learns more about the past , more about himself , and more about digging holes . i give this movie a 9.5 , because , i am very picky when it comes to books to movies , ( i want the movie to follow the book exactly ) . but , still it did real well .
uk newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know toby young , the journalist on whose real-life experiences this movie is based . the key word here is `` based '' . how to lose friends is a fictitious romcom . sidney young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in new york , where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally getting it right and making it . this involves him selling out , and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity . however , they are not overdone : the main substance remains a comedy which centres around sidney 's misadventures . the script has its cake and eats it in that sidney is a stupid , well-meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart , moderately obnoxious skilled writer . this contradiction is never that much of an issue , because simon pegg ( as sidney ) projects likability too well . jeff bridges underplays sidney 's editor a little too effectively , and kirsten dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of sidney 's affections and , with regard to megan fox ( who plays an airhead bimbo starlet ) , i can say only this : just say the word , miss fox , and i will leave my wife , sell all my belongings , and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort . of course , given that i 'm a fat 56-year-old english accountant , you might not find my offer too enticing , but it 's there on the table anyway . given how short her career has been so far , one might think it is a little too soon for megan fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become : however , she does it sweetly , with some skill , and extremely sexily . this girl will go far . there is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers - miriam margolyes and bill paterson from the uk , gillian anderson and danny huston from the us . there are several laugh-out-loud moments , and i smiled most of the way through . as ever , the f-word makes appearances when it really does n't need to , although at least a couple of these are very funny .
intriguing . exciting . dramatic . explosive . complex . epic . words that only touch the tip of the iceberg in terms of the grand story that is lost being told . from the acting down to the rare visual effects , lost is the essential show on television for fans of science-fiction , fantasy , action , adventure , and lots and lots of mystery . each cast member is so well chosen , and so good in their roles , that you either love them , or hate them , or downright wish them dead . the visual effects , when used ( which is rare ) are actually quite well done considering the usual production of shows . be it the `` smoke monster '' , to the polar bears , lost is believable in terms of eye-candy . as far as story goes , nothing can compare to the vast complexity this show has made viewers like me endure . beginning to end , continuity is virtually perfect , characters are developed , and the ever-evolving story slowly gives the answers to its questions so many crave . overall , there is practically no flaw in lost . it does for dramatic/sci-fi television what arrested development did for comedy : it has set the bar . i highly recommend lost to those that are patient , intellectual , and love every moment of the ride , no matter how long it takes to reach the end . see this show .
i went and saw rivers and tides again today . it 's the second time in two days and yes , i do see movies i like as many times as is necessary . yesterday i was struck by the brilliance of the images and goldsworthy 's works . this morning when i threw the coins i received # 29 the abysmal ( water ) . goldsworthy has an affinity with water , hence the title . i received the 5th line changing which moved to # 7 the army . to blake art was a war . anyway , i knew i had to see the film again . i read one of the few reviews extant online from the sf examiner . the critic loved the film but said goldsworthy 's comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film . he 'd rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack . so i was aware of that as i watched this second time . yesterday i thought that i 'd vote for andy goldsworthy as king of the world . well today i could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say . could i enjoy the film without his comments ? what he is doing , what he is saying goes way beyond `` art '' . his understanding of water , time , stone , change , and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of lao tsu or some avatar . some of his work/words are zen like . his knowledge ... anyway , the film is only ( apparently ) being shown here in the bay area . be a trend setter . go to your local cinema and tell them , no insist that they have to book a film you 've heard about from the hinter lands . it 's called rivers and tides .
i enjoyed this film very much . many korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them have tutors when they go to school . cinematography was average . the movie would have been better if the angel or the movement of the camera was more irregular . editing , however , was very neat and unusual . the acting was also very good . kim ha neul usually played an innocent , weak girl in the korean soap-opaeras . but this time , she plays a cute tomboy very well . kwon sang woo also plays his role very believable . what i like the most about this film is , the emotion of the characters are not too exaggerated . there are many korean romance films that the characters cry river before the audience and i always thought it was very stale . there was no such crap in this movie . very funny and well-done .
a first time director ( bromell ) has assembled a small but powerful cast to look at the world of a middle aged , middle class , depressed hit-man and his struggle with his relationship with his father . this film in less than 90 minutes presents an incredibly interesting contrast in human nature . david dorfman as the 6 year old son of william h. macy is the most refreshing little actor i 've seen in awhile . macy is brilliant in a part that almost seems written for him as a self tortured sole struggling to break the reins of his father and his business . it 's always great to see donald sutherland and here he 's wonderful as the callous father of macy . the films alternate audio track is well worth it to hear the director explain how he picked the cast , locations , and filmed the movie . the basic dolby 2 channel sound is adequate for this film and well recorded . the cinematography creates the mood along with a very subtle musical background . any film buff or observer of human nature will enjoy this one especially if he 's a fan of contradiction .
producer joel schumacher who also directed `` phone booth '' , '02 , and many other great films showed in great detail how no one person can really be trained to be a killing machine with out destroying their own personalities and the real fears that a person has to face when going into combat ! ! colin farrell ( roland bozz ) , '' intermission '' , '03 , gave one of his best performances and actually carried this entire picture on his back . matthew davis ( jim paxton ) , '' blue crush '' , '02 , gave a great supporting role and shea whigham ( pvt.wilson ) , '' all the real girls '' , '03 , showed his true acting skills in the role that he played . there was two brief scenes where the soldiers were able to find some hot romance on a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires . one army veteran instructor from viet nam told the soldiers how to really torture the enemy by using electrical wires in all the wrong places on a human male body . enjoyable and entertaining film to view .
three scumbags get their just deserts after wasting their lives in greed , drugs , ego , and bad attitudes . interesting and well done ; this style of film always makes me wonder where reality leaves off and imagination takes over . even though these folks were the scum of the earth i still found myself pitying them . they never really stood much of a chance .
1933 seemed to be a great year for satires ( `` duck soup '' for instance ) and this one fits in well even though it is about the obsession with contract bridge . the tone is like a humorous piece from the new yorker , appropriate , since the film begins with the `` goings on about town '' page of that magazine . the only thing odd is the casting . made a few years later william powell and myrna loy would have been perfect . however , after 1934 , you would n't have had adultery handled in such a sophisticated fashion , the young and beautiful loretta young in some shear and slinky outfits , or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge contest on radio . even if you know nothing about bridge , you may still want to check out a rare example of hollywood satire .
wonderland is the fascinating film chronicling the x-rated film star john c. holmes involvement in the brutal wonderland murders . the movie 's promotion misleads one into thinking this a romanticized portrayal of the porn industry in the vein of boogie nights and that is not the case here.in fact , except for a few references made by newscasters that john holmes is a porn star and a brief montage of real-life footage of john holmes this film is strictly drama about a fallen celebrity 's involvement with murder and how it happened . despite being mislead the film is actually engaging.the acting from all the cast is excellent and i 'd like to say that val kilmer is amazing in his ability to get down all the mannerisms of john holmes.i was completely convinced that i was watching what john c. holmes probably looked and acted like in real life . if you are a john c. holmes fan or like stories about hollywood then i think you will enjoy watching wonderland .
this movie will tell you why amitabh bacchan is a one man industry . this movie will also tell you why indian movie-goers are astute buyers . amitabh was at the peak of his domination of bollywood when his one-time godfather prakash mehra decided to use his image yet again . prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it , adding liberal doses of bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it . zanzeer saw the making of angry young man . lawaris was about being a bastard and namak halal was about the master-servant loyalties . but then , the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song , dance and drama . what comprised of the movie is a caricature of a haryanavi who goes to mumbai and turns into a regulation hero . amitabh 's vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks , thanks to his flawless stock haryanvi accent . to me , this alone is the biggest pull in the movie . the rest all is typical bollywood screen writing . amitabh , by now , had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies . thanks to manmohan desai . this movie had a good dose of them . the shoe caper in the party , the monologue over vijay merchant and vijay hazare 's considerations , the mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard amitabh fare . shashi kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody , finicky character ( remember him asking ranjeet to `` shaaadaaaap '' after the poisoned cake incident '' ) . his was the all important role of the master while amitabh was his loyal servant . but prakash mehra knew the indian mind ... and so shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie . it was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie . but this is a caper , remember ? and as long as it stayed that way , the people came and saw amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy . the end is always predictable , and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol , the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well . so what is it that makes this movie a near classic ? amitabh bacchan as the haryanvi . prakash mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story . chuck the story , the characters and the plot . my marks are for amitabh alone .
be careful with this one . once you get yer mitts on it , it 'll change the way you look at kung-fu flicks . you will be yearning a plot from all of the kung-fu films now , you will be wanting character depth and development , you will be craving mystery and unpredictability , you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops . sadly , you wo n't find all of these aspects together in one kung-fu movie , except for five deadly venoms ! easily the best kung-fu movie of all-time , venoms blends a rich plot , full of twists and turns , with colourful ( and developed ) characters , along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the 70s . the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which , and who specializes in what venom . one is the centipede , two is the snake , three is the scorpion , four is the lizard , and five is the toad . each character has different traits , characteristics , strengths , and weaknesses . therein lies the hook , we learn along with the student character , finding out who these different men turn out to be . we are in his shoes ( so to speak ) , and we have to pick who we trust , and who we do n't , just like he does . we learn along with him . not only is the plot , the characters , and the camerawork great , it 's also fun to watch , which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it 's kind . it 's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that 's going on . venoms is a lesson on what kung-fu can really do ... just do n't expect many other kung-fu films to live up to it 's gauntlet .
this movie is one of my all time favorites . cary grant , victor mclaglen , and douglas fairbanks jr ... what a cast . not to mention sam jaffe as gunga din . drama , action , adventure and comedy all rolled up into one . the final battle scene still to this day gives me chills and the ending always leaves me in tears . if you have n't seen it , i 'd strongly recommend it .
`` gandhi as a husband and father ? '' has always been discussed by people in india . 'gandhi ... my father ' is a story that only a few would have known to such details . surely an insight into gandhi 's personal life . overall , i liked the movie for story and cinematography . jariwala , akshay khanna , and shefali shah have all done a good job . most scenes of the movie would be nice desktop wallpapers ... commendable job . traditional indian folk music as background score during certain parts of the movie gives a good feel of the happenings . however , what i did n't quite like was the narration style . at several points , i found the tone over-dramatized . overall , good work by anil kapoor productions . i would recommend it as `` must-watch-once '' . 8/10
i remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and i was floored by parker posey 's performance . and the movie was pretty good also . for anyone who 's spent a little too much time in the nightclub/after-hours scene , this movie will have a special charm for you . not too serious , mostly funny , and parker posey definitely blazes her talented way through this indie gem . i especially liked the diaz character ( reminded me of every single struggling dj i 've ever known ) . and many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to preach the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about it . babaganoosh !
i have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about- this was a wonderful movie , and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel . the characters are truly young , mary is a strong match for byron , claire is juvenile and a tad annoying , polidori is a convincing beaten-down sycophant ... all are beautiful , curious , and decadent ... not the frightening wrecks they are in gothic . gothic works as an independent piece of shock film , and i loved it for different reasons , but this works like a merchant and ivory film , and was from my readings the best capture of what the summer must have felt like . romantic , yes , but completely rekindles my interest in the lives of shelley and byron every time i think about the film . one of my all-time favorites .
`` secret of the lens '' is perhaps a pretty campy all-time favorite of mine . the best and funniest from kajawari yoshiaki , who is known for splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime . i wish he did more campiness like this . my favorite scenes are the psychedelic cg sequence , the parts where lord helumis blows up his failing henchmen , the party riots that bill causes ( one of the funniest scenes ) and whenever my favorite character , worsle appears . check this out . warning : this is not for serious sophisticated anime fans !
a quiet , sweet and beutifully nostalgic movie on how it is to be confronted with old friends and surroundings from your youth with all that memories and the problems and sorrows of the present with you . a movie that makes you feel good . all the ingredients are here : old jelousy , rivalry , friendship and loyalty . mischief , nightly fridge-raids and all the other fun stuff that we all remember from our summer camps . all the characters get the opportunity for a week to experience this again as the old camp-leader now is retiring and want to meet the children from the golden years of the camp . all of them are now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers .
in new york , the family man dentist alan johnson ( don cheadle ) meets his former roommate and friend charlie fineman ( adam sandler ) by chance on the street . charlie became a lonely and deranged man after the loss of his wife and three daughters in the tragic september 11th while alan has problems to discuss his innermost feelings with his wife . alan reties his friendship with charlie and they become close to each other . alan tries to fix charlie 's life , sending him to the psychologist angela oakhurst ( liv tyler ) , but charlie has an aggressive reaction to the treatment and is send to court . `` reign over me '' is a good drama about loss , friendship , family and loneliness . the september 11th is irrelevant to the plot ; it could be a car accident , a fire or any other tragedy , as well as the sexual harassment of donna remar , played by the gorgeous saffron burrows , to alan . but the family drama works , supported by the great performances of adam sandler and don cheadle . liv tyler is quite impossible to be recognized , i do not know whether she is using excessive make-up to look older , but her face is weird . my vote is seven . title ( brazil ) : `` reine sobre mim '' ( `` reign over me '' )
this film is definitely an odd love story . though this film may not be much to shout about , nicole kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten , though ben chaplin does do quite a good job of hertfordshire life with shots of st albans & hemel hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area . what starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular british tv series '' heartbeat '' soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick.nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends-up as fairly decent weekend entertainment . a good one to watch , and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character .
first off , i 'm a huge fan of 80s movies , and of jennifer conelly as well . so yesterday , i wandered into a local used book/movie store and found a vhs copy . i read the back and it sounded good and for $ 3.99 , it was a good deal . so i took it home and popped it in the vcr . what a sweet movie ! at my age now , i relate more to movies like about last night or st. elmo 's fire , but still i remember what it was like to be 15/16 and in love with an older guy , etc . we all have those little crushes when we 're younger . and if it does n't work out , we 're heartbroken and we think that we 'll never get over it . but of course we do . many times . it 's that sort of sweet quality that i really got from this movie . the feeling of `` oooh ! i remember when something like that happened to me ... '' is all through it . the characters are interesting and well-developed . i recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies , teen films in particular , or to anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives .
slow but beautifully-mounted story of the american revolution . griffith 's story-telling seems a lot less heavy-handed than in his earlier historical epics and his tableaux work is fully integrated into the action . lionel barrymore is an utter swine , neil hamilton is poor but dashing and carol dempster is .... well , carol dempster is most of what is wrong with griffith in this period , but she does n't show up often enough to slow the pace and drama . note that the trivia for this movie says it came in originally at slightly more than 2 hours when first released , but that no cut exists that runs longer than 90 minutes . however , the dvd release has been presented at a slower fps rate that increases the tension and brings it back to a bit over two hours . far better in terms of story-telling than sound versions , such as the patriot . while not quite in the league of griffith 's best , such as way down east and broken blossoms , an excellent way to spend a couple of hours .
like many people here , i started out finding my patience being tried by this film . by the end , i actually shed a few tears . it seems to be in the nature of most old films to drag for 7/8th length and then catch fire right at the end . older film-goers learned to bide their time patiently through the slow parts , calm in the knowledge that the big payoff is on the way . but that is n't quite accurate . you see , to earlier audiences , what are to us the `` slow parts '' were the main body of the story . they watched and found anecdotal and thematic interest there . modern audiences , post-spielberg , are in a constant state of waiting to be hit with a small climax every two minutes when they see older films . it 's the inflation problem of modern movies . well , that is n't going to happen . it is not necessary to apologize for these films ; it is simply that you have to adjust your expectations and personal rhythm when you watch them . at this point , the difference between avatar and the informer is like the difference between euripides and a traveling production of rent . think about it for a minute or two . not to strain at the obvious , but euripides still deserves a hearing . the `` exciting part '' , for most modern viewers , begins with the ira tribunal scene and escalates to the final couple of minutes , which , if you are at all on board or even paying attention by that time , will tear your heart out . it 's not some high-tone universal abstract plea for forgiveness ; it 's a plea from one dimwit , and those who feel sorry for the big lummox , for a little mercy . it 's that personal , and that embarrassingly naked an appeal . for after being mad at gypo , irritated at him , thinking this is the dumbest character of all time , you finally find yourself won over by the scene of gypo 's erstwhile girlfriend pleading to another woman to talk her man into going easy him . the film may be sentimental , but the sentimentality is not cheap as some here have charged . there 's a matter of life and death that plays out here , and as long as you take the proposition of one life to a customer seriously , it 's sentimentality wrung out of the most serious stuff . 8 of 10 . and the fault for it not being 10 of 10 is my own and in some measure yours , if you are reading this . we have all asked for more , ever more , faster , ever faster until we can not put ourselves in 1935 -- just yesterday , really -- as easily as we should be able .
i also just got back from an advanced screening of redeye and i must say i have n't had so much fun at a movie in a long time . wes craven is at his best ever . he brings us an amazing end of summer thriller i was so desperately craving . this is the thriller of the year .. no doubt . all the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun . the f/x were great . it steadily built suspense . i was on the edge of my seat most of the movie . it 's been a while since i heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater . if your looking for thrills , action and a good plot this summer , redeye delivers . go see it !
1928 is in many ways a `` lost year '' in motion pictures . just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre , sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology . `` show people '' is one of the great silent era comedies . the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him , learns his lesson , and then redeems himself by winning the football game , the polo game , etc . this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane . she had excellent comic instincts and timing . this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies-like adventure of peggy pepper ( marion davies ) and her father , general marmaduke oldfish pepper , fresh from the old south . general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress . while at the studio commissary , the peppers run into billy boone ( william haines ) , a slapstick comedian . he gets peggy an acting job . she 's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick , but she perseveres . eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles . soon the new-found fame goes to her head , and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man , whom she does n't really love , unless fate somehow intervenes . one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at mgm circa 1930 . this film is one of those , as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy 's autograph , an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself , and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot . peggy grimaces and mentions that she does n't care for her . truly a delight from start to finish , this is a silent that is definitely worth your while . this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible .
this movie maked me cry at the end ! i watch at least 3-4 movies a week . i seen loads of great movies , even more crap - ones . but when ending scene - catharsic at it 's core - came i cried ! and if you did n't - you have serious problems ! the story is archetypal - nothing new or original . but it 's real - because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist . glam is n't my sort of music but i really admire all that they went through in early 70 's ... at some point this directed me toward velvet goldmine ! docudramas never really work very good . but this movie really meked us believe it all ... because they do n't try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts , present musicians that are superheroes , groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb , they do n't glorify drugs and alcohol , they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even 20 years late ... once again great movie . since `` leaving las vegas '' i was never so moved by a movie .
those french and those germans sure have a long history of not liking each other . it is interesting to note that kamerdaschaft or comradeship in translation takes place in 1931 . only a few years later , hitler would siege germany and begin his plans to take over the world , france being a casualty of his ambitions . but these are times of sereneness compared to the future . a group of miners at the border try to cross over to france to get work . they are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their french neighbors . then a disaster happens in the mines of the french and a well-crafted and written scene , a troupe of german miners decide to come to the rescue . a simple story is it not ? pabst was a poet of silent cinema and i am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not , but his poetry is there to be discovered . he is n't fussy but brings a rugged realism to the ordeal . ther is even a flashback to a wwii event that beckons the point of this story . supposedly based on a real event , the movie does the events proudly with directness and terseness . smetimes , that 's what a movie needs to be .
normally , i do n't watch action movies because of the fact that they are usually all pretty similar . this movie did have many stereotypical action movie scenes , but the characters and the originality of the film 's premise made it much easier to watch . david duchovny bended his normal acting approach , which was great to see . angelina jolie , of course , was beautiful and did great acting . great cast all together . a must see for people bored with the same old action movie .
without a doubt , 12 monkeys is one of the best films of the sci-fi genre and director terry gilliam is no stranger at pulling off such cinematic originality . an apocalyptic film that holds you completely spellbound , 12 monkeys never lets up and has you guessing all the way throughout . excellent use of philadelphia locales and netherworld sets create a gothic sense of tragedy and two people caught in time at the wrong place . bruce willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony who happens to be right about all that will happen . he is actually sane , but the people of the future ( or present if you will ) distort this guy 's head so bad through time travel , no wonder he unravels . he gets sent to world war i just after beng sent to the wrong year to find out how the army of the twelve monkeys pulls off the annihilation of civilization as we know it . they finally get it right and in what is truly a remarkable screenplay to match the performance , we get to see willis , madeleine stowe and an ominous brad pitt cross-referenced over the course of 6 years . stowe is sensual and solid as the risk-taking shrink who slowly starts to realize that willis may not be as cracked up as he seems . a captivating element of the relationship between her and willis is their sense of `` seeing '' each other before , in another place or time . 12 monkeys is essentially about time and the madness the futuristic people immerse into it and the times of the present , when killers and a psychotic genius can alter the world . the brooding city of philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for willis ' plight to complete his mission which is , against all usual hollywood stereotype , not to save the world . he is gathering information . the film plays tricks on the viewer as well , placing willis in a new setting at the drop of a pin . this must have been an extremely difficult picture to make but gilliam seems to be the master of hard-boiled movie making . he even drops in some humor reminiscent of other great works like time bandits , and brazil . the screen is this man 's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes terrifying picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big-budget films . if you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy , see 12 monkeys . rating : 9 of 10
new york , i love you finally makes it to our shores , but its 10 short stories on love somehow did n't find reason enough to be released over valentine 's , probably due to the fact that this year 's festival also falls on lunar new year , and with that comes the usual lny blockbuster films from the likes of jackie chan ( no , not the spy next door ) and local filmmaker jack neo who has traditionally released his latest film over that period to resounding success . so why fix a formula that has n't been broken ? continuing in concept where paris , je t'aime had begun in spawning the city of love franchise ( shanghai will be next , so says the end of the closing credits here ) , the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme , although someone probably forgot to tell scarlett johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules , and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else ( well , it was shot in black and white ) , but here 's hoping that it would make it to the dvd at least . structurally , this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor , which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created . here a little more leeway is given , where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together , and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes , in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers , though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise , though already seen in paris . one of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one , is definitely the creative forces behind the stories , from writers , directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city , coming together for a concept film . and what more the star-studded cast too , with big names amongst the lesser known ones all upping the ante through picture perfect performances , be it for the entire length of the short , or as a support to build upon . you ca n't deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables , from irrfan khan to natalie portman ( who also had writing and directing duties ) , rachel bilson ( looking quite like bardot ) to spielberg 's blue eye boy shia labeouf , who surprisingly can act , and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to date . story wise , like any anthology , you 'll find some which will automatically appeal to you , and with others that do n't . some are straightforward in nature , while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked . but these 10 stories plus 1 ( because randall balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks ) somehow lacked the more `` anything goes '' spirit from its predecessor , with stories more rooted in reality , compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film ( elijah wood 's dalliance with a vampire anyone ? ) , or even less adventurous with its narrative style ( christopher doyle 's , and tom tykwer 's starring natalie portman ) . here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe , with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment . minor quibbles aside , i still enjoyed almost all the shorts here , contrary to what many others have felt about it . the short film format is still very much alive , and having them strung together into a feature under the city of love banner works fine , and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its lineup . i am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here . we surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a singapore , i love you , so here 's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road . otherwise there 's always the sawasdee bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules .
this is a feel good film , about one person 's dreams and the drive or push to realize them . it is a beautiful and inspirational film . why do some people have to try and find fault with every film that comes out , especially the good ones . dennis quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of jim morris , a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take one more shot at a professional baseball career . with excellent supporting cast , including brian cox , as the crusty old ex navy officer who has let so much of his son 's achievements go by without his support . it was good to see him as something other than a villain in a film . if i have one complaint with this film it is this : do n't ever let royce applegate sign the national anthem again . seriously , this film belongs to that handful of great baseball films like `` field of dreams '' and `` the natural . '' it rates two thumbs up and a big `` well done . ''
barbara stanwyck plays lily powers . she 's a waitress for her father 's speakeasy in a little crummy mining town . he also sells her to men . she escapes to new york and literally sleeps her way to the top . originally i had only seen the 71 minute version but it 's pretty extreme -- for its time . nowadays it 's pretty tame . the movie moves very quickly and has tons of sexual innuendo -- some of it comes off as pretty silly ( but fun ) today . it moves so quickly you can easily ignore that most of it could never happen -- even in 1933 . there 's nothing classic or monumental about this -- it 's just a quick , gleefully dirty little film that 's lots of fun . it only falls apart at the end with a little `` moral '' ending that the censors demanded . it comes across as unbelievable and stupid ( i saw it in a theatre and the audience laughed at it -- one guy quite rightfully said `` no way '' ) i just saw the uncut 75 minute version which has a different , somewhat tragic and much better ending . this version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake ! i believe this is the only one in release -- but be aware . the acting is good -- stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it way over the top . she makes you believe that she enjoys being cruel and sleeping around . there are also strong supporting performances from handsome donald cook and george brent . also look for a pre-stardom john wayne in a hilarious bit as a meek and mild office worker ! fun , dirty and fast . i give this a 9 .
the devil dog : hound of hell is really good film . it has good acting by the cast including richard crenna and r.g . armstrong.the music is spooky and gives that devilish chill ! i liked the effects on the dog and i think the creature itself looked really cool with its horns , frill like part on his neck , and acted really viscous ! if you like horror films and have n't seen the devil dog : hound of hell before and are able to find and buy this rare film then do so because its a good movie and i do n't think you 'll be disappointed !
although i do n't usually go for relentlessly heartwarming fare like this , i happened to catch the 1994 version of angels in the outfield ( aito ) on cable one saturday morning just as it was starting . being an adrien brody fan , i was curious to see what brody was like as a youth of 21 ( 20 when he filmed it , i suppose ) in this early role as danny hemmerling , utility infielder for the california angels ( in the 1951 original , the hard-luck baseball team was the pittsburgh pirates . the name change is a nice touch , since it turns the title into wordplay ) . i decided to give the flick a chance , and it turned out to be a pretty painless , even amiable experience , with a decent balance of laughs , tears , sweetness , and baseball-based excitement . also , my 7-year-old daughter liked the angel effects ! : - ) directed by mike nesmith 's frequent collaborator william dear , aito is the story of roger ( joseph gordon-levitt ) , a foster child who prays real hard after his ne'er-do-well dad ( the convincingly sleazy dermot mulroney ) sarcastically says they 'll be a family again once the last-place california angels win the pennant . soon roger starts seeing real angels at the angels ' games , led by christopher lloyd , whose usual zany , eccentric irreverence keeps aito from plummeting irretrievably into the schmaltz zone . crusty manager george knox ( danny glover in world-weary , exasperated mode ) is a hard sell , but once the team starts winning , he believes roger 's angel sightings , and soon knox has roger and his cute li ' l pal and fellow foster kid j.p. ( the adorable milton davis jr. ) at every angels game for good luck . knox even starts toning down his own temperamental outbursts and profane language , as much to appease the angels as for the kids ' sake , resulting in a funny bit when he starts dressing down an umpire in his usual way but starts editing himself as he goes along . predictable obstacles ensue , such as obnoxious sportcaster ranch wilder ( jay o. sanders ) trying to make trouble for knox because of the angel angle . sure , it all works out fine for our heroes in the end , but they 're so darn amiable you do n't mind ! : - ) baby-faced brody has a couple of good lines ( i especially like his exchange with glover about the emotional impact of the national anthem at a ballgame ) as well as a cute bit where a pretty blonde angel massages his shoulders before he goes up to bat . brody is n't the only future star in aito 's lineup : his teammates include matthew mcconaughey and neal mcdonough , and of course , young gordon-levitt went on to co-star in tv 's 3rd rock from the sun as well as such films as 10 things i hate about you . the always-amusing taylor negron and oscar winners ( but not for this film : - ) brenda fricker and ben johnson lend able support . if you 're a baseball fan who wants to rent a movie appropriate for the kids and check out some notable young actors before they became stars , aito '94 will do nicely .
carter wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing which leads him seeking ultimate vengeance ! the pacing is good in this film and there are a lot of fight scenes to keep the movie going . the flying guillotines look wicked and the main villain has no problems using them . although the story is n't strong , the action is fun and draws you to the very end ( which i felt could 've had a sequel ) . campy and dark , this is great ol skool kung fu ! !
back in 2004 i saw `` true '' , tom tykwer 's contribution to paris je t'aime . when i saw it i loved it and became thrilled . it became my favorite short film and made me appreciate the format so much . of course i wanted to watch the whole film , and i would even check who was attached , etc . yesterday i finally saw it , courtesy of the internet . first of all i must say that it looks awesome . the photography is beautiful in every short and shot , at the worst being nothing special - but still brilliant and clear . later i read the trivia here , and maybe it 's how scanning in 6k gives more justice to all the dp 's work . my special favorites are the `` quais de seine '' first scene ( that sunlight ! ) , the sin city-esquire ( but better for me ) `` quartier de la madeleine '' , and `` 14th arrondisement '' - but you know , what the hell i like them all : `` true '' or `` faubourg saint-denis '' still makes me nervous with those brilliant colours ( my eyes , they tremble ! ) and `` quartier latin '' is gold imprisoned on silver . beautiful . yes , these are some beautiful short films . now let 's get onto the content . i very much ( and i mean very much ) like the eclecticism that is so successfully felt . you never have have the same themes or treatment between two shorts , and i think the formula is restrictive enough to let all these artists explore beautiful and deepening things inside the shorts . i loved coming from a simple love story into a crazy-chinese-musical-in-paris-with-barbet-schroeder into a social commentary into a terror comedy into a humble monologue . i love surprises ! and this film has them ! it 's great they took a chance to let all these director 's flesh out things that are not usual in mainstream cinema ( which i have come to heavily despise ) . it 's not heavily experimental , but i can breath the breathing space these people had . i like the small time and i love the acting . i love the simplicity and i love the love . i like the simple feelings and the beauty and the eclecticism and in general it 's a film that is very very very nice to see , alone or with someone . to simply feel . it left me feeling very good . there is something about the earnestness in it ... it 's so frank ... what i did n't like ? well , for me there are two shorts that are n't exactly the best - `` quais de seine '' ( which is good natured , sure , and maybe even necessary , but feels too much like a commercial ? ) and `` père-lachaise '' that even though i love the acting , i felt it 's themes were forced . but that of course , is just me . `` tour eiffel '' i also did n't love but i think is probably because of my very different sensibility from that of sylvain chomet ? i do n't know if this film has a special interest for people who already know the actor 's and directors , and so they can delight in their interaction , in the surprises ( look out for alexander payne in a funny role ) and basically in `` what will this director do with this ? '' great question . i enjoyed it very much in that way . i repeat now : most shorts i loved and all of them together form a beautiful and energetic mix . i definitely recommend it . definitely ! ! ! so , watch it if you like eclectic beautiful love !
wealthy psychiatrist lindsay crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it 's hopeless to help her patients . a young gambling junkie client asks her to help him pay off his debts if he truly wants to help him get better . here she gets involved with joe mantegna . to reveal any more of the plot would spoil one hell of a fun movie and 'house of games ' may very well be the best con movie i 've seen . david mamet wrote and directed this gem that 's full of snappy dialogue , great one-liners , and enough twists to keep you guessing til the end . crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con-man . and with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie , the film is in utter control of it 's audience ; and we are loving the con . * * * out of * * * *
it 's a little disconcerting to have a character named gig young in a movie ... played by gig young . but this film is where gig got his name and also a nice career boost after playing small parts under another name . i 'm going to go against the majority of the other comments and state that i really enjoyed this film , mainly because of the vibrant performance of barbara stanwyck as fiona . she was funny , angry , vulnerable , caring , and feisty as the oldest of three daughters whose mother died on the lusitania , and whose father was later killed during woar war i . as the `` man '' of the house , fiona has stood steadfast for years against settling her father 's will which would therefore allow a donald trump type named charles barclay to get the family home . but fiona 's keeping a secret as to why she hates barclay so much . geraldine fitzgerald is the middle , flirty sister , who is married to an englishman but craves her youngest sister 's boyfriend ( gig young ) . if you 're a stanwyck fan , this is a no miss .
`` erendira '' is a film from mexico that is rarely talked about . the film only exists in a low quality vhs format . it 's a shame this film has n't been given a dvd release . `` erendira '' is stunning and gorgeous with its magic-realist images . `` erendira '' is based on a short story from the novel `` 100 years of solitude '' . erendira is constantly daydreaming and accidentally burns down her grandma 's house . her evil grandma , played by irene papas , forces her into prostitution to pay for the damages . the whole town gets a piece of erendira , so to speak . although the subject matter sounds harsh , the film does n't exploit sexuality . it 's done in a mature artistic manner . the film also has some amazing costumes . some of the more surreal aspects of the film that stand out the most , are the origami birds that morph into real birds , and a golden orange with a diamond in the center . erendira is an amazing film , that even manages to throw in humor . this is definitely a film that deserves a special dvd release . as they 'd say in espanol , `` es muy muy bien ! ! ! excellente !
the horse is indeed a fine animal . picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation flick . the animation is simply stupendous . the fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses embolden across the flick . more so when the stallion traverses diverse terrain , jumps across cliffs and braves waters . soundtrack too is very impressive . the wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie . `` they say the story of the west was written from the saddle of a horse . `` huh ? well , the story of a fine horse sure was written from the saddle of the west . all in all , this movie is clearly up there with the best .it is one of the best animation flicks i have watched . would be a very fine choice on a lonely night . an easy 9/10 .
with all thats going on in the world sometimes we need an escape . curly sue is just that . not a complicated plot or deep meaning ; however it is not devoid of substance . there is more than furious action or heart pounding dramas . there are the charming little shows you can watch with your kids and have enough substance to enjoy with your date . try it you may like it more than you think . the little girl is really smart and cute . the `` dad '' and the girl go thru some slapstick routines . when a jealous boyfriend steps in , trouble brews for curly and the life shes known may be torn asunder . fred thompson and kelly lynch play good roles as the upper crust and alison porter and james belushi are a interesting fable like duo portraying street wise homeless drifters . their worlds collide and comedy ensues .

tim krabbe is the praised author of 'het gouden ei ' , a novel that was put on the screen twice ( 'spoorloos ' and 'the vanishing ' ) . one of the dutch writer 's more recent works is 'de grot ' , a psychological thriller about two totally different men , egon and axel , who meet at a youth camp and , surprising enough , become friends for dear life . egon is a quiet , somewhat dull person , who spends his time studying and writing geography books . axel , on the other hand , is a charismatic 'party-animal ' , a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday 's concern is to get a woman into his bedroom . from the moment they meet , axel has a strong influence on egon , while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything ( such as reading thick books like egon ) ; ultimately , egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself , which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country . after having read the book last year , i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it . in my opinion , the book suffers especially from the complex structure . while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people , the plot becomes more of a puzzle : the many episodes are not presented chronologically , so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode . because of this , the story feels surprisingly remote : you often need to know a character 's background to really care for him or her . another complaint was the fact that the main characters , egon and axel , are a little stereotypical . egon is 'the ' dull intellectual , while axel is his exact opposite . in real life , such one-dimensional people rarely exist ; in books and films , they always seem to be there , taking away a lot of credibility . despite all this , the film was a pleasant surprise , being much better than the book . the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography , humour and acting : fedja van huet ( egon ) is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting ( which is , in my opinion , the highest an actor can achieve ) . the drawbacks of the film , however , are the same as the book 's : mainly because the characters are one-dimensional , they are so predictable that it becomes annoying . guess who wrote the script ? indeed , krabbe himself . it is obvious that this talented director ( that 's what the movie makes clear anyway ) is hampered by a deficient screenplay . perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book . 7/10
what a good movie ! at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock : illusions of fame . well-known rockers are getting old and forgotten , not the music . and with a good sense of humour . have you ever danced on bill haley 's rock around the clock ? anyway , still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n'roll i have ever seen . far much better than spinal tap for instance . why ? because in still crazy , people are mature . they have a different point of view about rock , about love and about life . they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much . beyond the story itself , we see characters with their own personality , weaknesses and dreams . like anyone of us . spend a good time watching this ( listen to the awesome soundtrack ! ) and finally thinking of your own future . bye !
this movie is rich with action and gore . the story line is strong enough to support the action sequences . the english version needs a tad bit of help in the dubbing department but it was still enjoyable . this movie ranks among my personal favorites next to `` hard boiled '' ...
the human tornado is a campy 70 's blaxploitation movie starring nightclub comedian rudy ray moore in perhaps his most endearing role to date . the movie tells the tale of dolemite , a bad ass pimpin ' hustler who gets on the wrong side of a white , racist sheriff by sleeping with his wife . dolemite barely escapes , and journeys to sunny california to visit an old friend , a nightclub owner ( and madam to dolemite 's 'ladies ' ) named queen bee . however , it seems that a rival nightclub owner with mob connections is trying to muscle in on her racket , so dolemite takes matters into his own hands . rudy ray moore showcases many diverse talents in this landmark film , including strong dramatic skills , a mastery of kung fu , an impressive singing voice ( he provides two of the songs on the soundtrack ) , a touching , compassionate side with the ladies , and an overall compelling charisma and keen sense of comic timing . this film has it all , people : a deep plot , blistering action , laugh-a-minute comedy , beautiful women in distress , a slam-bang ending ... what more could you ask from a movie ? run , do n't walk , to your local video store and rent the human tornado today . and be sure to share it with your family .
well , i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie . despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy , and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason , i was not disappointed . the story was actually pretty interesting : the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil , and who is using them for good . the catch being that during training , all of the clan were masked , and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names . the fights are a joy to watch , as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style : toad ( my favorite ) , snake , scorpion , lizard , and centipede . the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place , and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action . the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence . but stick with it , and you wo n't be disappointed !
the latest film by the spanish director agusti villaronga is a study on how children that experience violence and isolation within their remote community , develop into troubled young adults that need certain psychic tools to deal with their hidden mental frailty . whether these tools are religion followed to a fanatical level , caring for others or simply putting on a macho image whilst engaging as a male-prostitute , villaronga creates a successful examination of how these vices affect three teenagers living in spain under franco . the three witness the disturbing double death or their friends before they are teenagers and subsequently bury the emotions they feel with their peers frail corpses until they meet again once more at a hospital for those suffering form tuberculosis . the cinematic style of the text is typically visually opulent as you would expect from the spanish auteur and is extremely reminiscent of fellow spaniard pedro almodovar 's work with themes dealing with sexual desire , both heterosexual and homosexual . an element that is different between the two directors is that villaronga favours a supernatural undertone spliced with claustrophobic , gritty realism opposed to almodovar 's use of surrealism , although both styles are similar . the piece gives an insight into troubled young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of a sexual nature . i highly recommend watching this film as it contains elements that will remain with the audience for a considerable period after viewing .
as i saw the movie i was really shocked to see what the 60 's was about . i know i may be wrong about some things , but it seemed like the 60 's really had an effect on people of the time . some people said they would want to go back to the 60 's . from what i saw i would say yes for the excitement and no for the outcome . but that 's my opinion .
one of the most interesting movies to be classified as `` blaxploitation , '' bakshi 's `` coonskin '' is a rich text full of wonderful insight . he wrote it in collaboration with scat man crothers and barry white , who appear in the film as well . the racist imagery can often be disturbing , but the message of the movie was so powerful that the naacp gave it an endorsement ( but only grudgingly ) . i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in an examination of the pervading atmosphere of racism that bakshi attempts to deconstruct . wonderful stuff .
i watched the dvd of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track ( in english ) . it seems in cambodia ( the subtitles in english say the character is speaking thai but the movie says cambodia ) a very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill . he sends pang to kill some people in china and during the killings a cop 's partner is killed . the cop wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma . wai 's chief is his dad 's friend and is worried about wai 's erratic behavior . he does n't know wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma . pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father wo n't let her leave ( pang does n't speak chinese and does n't understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for cat iii ) . wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting pang but pang is almost unstoppable . even after pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant wai follows and joins the evil man ( who 's training the boys ) making a deal to fight and train so he can get pang . there is a big showdown between wai and pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving wai dead and pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer . this film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack . there are many very brutal violent scenes . the woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot . knives to the neck and torso . guns fired directly to the head . and several very intense beatings . it maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing .
ben thomas ( smith ) plays an irs agent who practically gives the store away to everyone 's surprise . what kind of irs agent is this ? most of us have all heard the line by an irs agent , `` hello , i 'm from the irs . i 'm here to help . '' our smile then spreads into a chuckle that says , `` yeah , right . '' as you get further and further into this story , you can not figure this guy out . he goes easy on those who are being audited . what is his motive ? is he from another planet , an angel , a rich guy who wants to do good ? he helps so much we want him to be our auditor should we get audited , of course . hey , irs , are you listening ? ( kidding , just kidding ) the pace of the movie is perfect and so much so that clues were ignored that would have told me what was really going on . intense , repeat intense , focus was on ben and stays there . the whole movie only works because of ben as we try to figure him out and i did n't see any clues ( what clues you talking about , willis ? ) . not reading the box before watching the dvd movie was the better way to go here . by the end of the movie i finally put it all together . well , it was obvious by then . and , yes , it 's over the top , but still a great story , mostly because of will smith . will smith should have been nominated for a best actor award . the rest of the cast were very good as well . yes , it 's over the top and despite the great acting and when you finally get all the answers you must realize that the message of the movie is all wrong . what 's the message ? believe me , you will wo n't need too many clues to figure it out . i did n't . violence : no . sex : yes , but nothing to get excited about . bland . nudity : no . language : no .
the journey of hope ( 1990 ) is about a trek that many nomadic and poor turks make so they could live the good life in switzerland . these people are so desperate to live like westerners that they 'll give up their life and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land . so many of them are swindled by greedy crooks who make their living off of charging huge fees for desperate people who are in a no win situation . one family braves the cold , the treacherous mountain range and predatory criminals only to discover that there 's not always a shining white light at the end of the tunnel . this problem exists world wide , not just in america . some people tend to forget that . a heart breaker of a film that 'll leave you wondering why at the end . highly recommended .
i watched this film many years ago and have searched for it ever since in my opinion although very raw it is very educational as to what the future can hold i enjoyed the movie and to this this day rate it very high sorry to all those that disagree but a movie should always be judged each to there own and in my opinion its great give it a go with all the cloning and test tube babies that are happening today who are we to judge this film , this may be a dramatised event of what is to become but there you go . all the horrors of today are so far fetched even i laugh but this one gets me thinking and it scares me as a mother what if i was desperate , after watching this movie i would think twice sorry but i love the movie make your own mind up do n't watch the movie making- just aknowledge the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child ?
why did it sound like the husband kept calling her appy ? it ruined a great episode and so i can only give it a 6 . proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film . it was very hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though i dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die . the more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining . i do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre . 6/10 come on yankies get your english up to par !
film dominated by raven-haired barbara steele , it was seen when i was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle , seeking blood . steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty , and the views of the walking dead pre-date romero 's night of the living dead shamblers , unifying them in my mind . i do n't see the connection between this film and the haunting , which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present . la danza macabre is a b-movie without pretention , daring you to fall in love with barbara steele and suffer the consequences . there 's no such draw to haunting 's overwrought claire bloom . the comparisons to the haunting are superficial . and no , this movie does not need to be remade . not only is it a product of the sixties , but the large percentage of talentless cretins in hollywood can not fathom macabre 's formula for terror . that formula is based on one overriding factor : good writing . low-grade classics like castle and corman 's poe films with r. matheson and tourneur 's out of the past share a commonality of strong writing . it 's simple . get a real writer like richard matheson or steve mcquarrie and let them put a plot into today 's cinematic mess . besides that , let hollywood attempt some original material for a change , and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past .
a french novelist , disgusted by his wife 's society friends , goes to north africa for a respite . there he encounters a vivacious & talented bedouin girl , living in poverty . to spite his wife , who is romancing a maharajah , he decides to train & educate the girl , and present her to parisian society as the princesse tam tam ... the marvelous josephine baker is perfectly cast in the title role in this very enjoyable french film . with her enormous eyes & infectious smile , she makes contact with the viewer 's heartstrings immediately . her over-sized personality & obvious joy of performing make her a pure pleasure to watch . baker makes us care about what 's happening to poor alwina during her transformation & introduction to european mores . albert préjean does very well as the pygmalion to baker 's galatea ; also effective are georges peclet as a half-caste servant , and jean galland as the mysterious maharajah . the film is very handsome & well made , looking a little reminiscent of busby berkeley movies being produced at the same time in america - although unlike american films of this period , princesse tam tam has n't any racism . it should be pointed out that there was no hays office or production code in france . some of the dialogue & action is rather provocative , but it must be admitted that baker singing & dancing to 'under the african sky , ' as well as her culminating performance in the parisian nightclub , are two of the cinema 's more memorable moments . actual location filming in tunisia greatly enhances the film . josephine baker was born in st. louis in 1906 , into a very poor family . her talent & driving ambition , however , soon pushed her into moving east and she was briefly a cast member of the ziegfeld follies . realizing that america in the mid-1920 's held great limitations for a gifted black woman , she managed to get herself to paris , where she eventually joined the foliés-bergeres & le negre revue . the french adored her and she became a huge celebrity . a short return to america in 1935 showed baker that things had not changed for african-americans . she returned to france , became a french citizen & worked for the resistance during the early days of the war . baker relocated to morocco for the duration and entertained allied troops stationed there . after the war , baker 's fortunes began to slide and she faced many financial & personal difficulties . for a while , she was even banned from returning to the united states . finally , baker accepted an offer from princess grace of monaco to reside in the principality . josephine baker was on the verge of a comeback when she died of a stroke in 1975 , at the age of 68 . having appeared in only two decent films - zouzou & princesse tam tam - baker is in danger of becoming obscure . but she deserves her place alongside chevalier , dietrich & robeson , as one of her generation 's truly legendary performers .
fascinating yet unsettling look at edith bouvier beale ( big edie ) and her daughter ( little edie ) aunt and first cousin to the late jacquelyn kennedy onasis . they live in a rodent infested , rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city . it becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric . little edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53 . the content is pretty much made up of two things . the first are the conversations were little edie lambastes big edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer , actress , and dancer . these discussions usually become very rhetorical , nonsensical , and often times amusing . the second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties . each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it 's only the other who sounds bad . in one amazing scene big edie actually physically attacks little edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling . very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it . the filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus , coming each day to record ( and chuckle ) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about . ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by . their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in . despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever . for without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness . most amazing line comes from big edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom . her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable .
i am a huge john denver fan . i have a large collection of his music on vinyl . i saw this christmas special when it was originally on tv and loved it . i have the original vinyl album and cd . i have the original cd and later release . the later release is missing several songs though . i see that it has been released this year with all original songs . to my surprise i found the original cd for sale at $ 75.00 . wow - to think that a christmas cd would be worth that much . to me no amount is worth selling this treasure . it is my favorite christmas cd . i have never been able to find it on vhs or dvd . i would love to have either version . if anyone has one available please let me know . thanks
by the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet . the movie never , and i do mean never , lets up in action . it may be mild action but it 's action . once again every member of the cast fits perfectly . the explosions were realistic , the chase scenes were feasible , and the fighting was incredible . matt damon will forever be jason bourne . all i really have to say is that every bourne movie gets better and this is no exception . the action , the stakes , the plot . how they do it i will never know . i applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies . because if he had n't done such a great job with the first movie , we would n't have this one to talk about . so do n't go see it in theaters , go experience it in theaters if it 's still out where you live , but if not december 11th bourne comes home to you !
to say this film is simply a demonisation of catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue . that is not what this film is . what this film is is a comment on the abuses of the church ( although this could be substituted for any powerful body ) , the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves . the fact that it is the catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon . to label this as propaganda against catholics seems to miss the truth about what the catholic church has done at times ; its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted . yes we should comment on the abuses committed by other organisations but that is not for the remit of this film . it is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching - 'if we do not study the past , we are bound to repeat it '
after dark , my sweet is a great , modern noir , filled with seedy characters , dirt roads , and , of course , sweaty characters . it seems that most of the truly great noirs of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south , where the men glisten and the ladies , um , glisten too . why ? because it 's hooooottttttttttt . and because everyone looks better wet ( at least the men do - sweaty women leave me clammy ) . anyway - there might be some spoilers in here . this film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be - steady pacing ( though some with attention disorders refer to it as 'slow ' ) , clearly and broadly drawn ( though not simple ) characters , and tons of atmosphere . noir , if anything , is about moods and attitudes . that 's why the great ones are not marked by your traditional definitions of 'great ' acting ( look at bogart , mitchum , hurt , and nicholson - they ( and their characters ) were anything but real - but they had style and sass and in a crime movie that 's exactly what you want ) . or quickly paced adventures ( again all great noirs seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette ) . great noirs create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours . after dark my sweet let 's you do that - and it let 's you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters . uncle bud and collie are intriguing - never allowing the audience to know what really makes them tick - and patric and dern ( i love bruce dern , by the way ) are pitch perfect , dern especially ( see previous comment ) . they take the basic outlines of a character and give them depth and elicit our sympathies . the story itself is also interesting . there 're better plots in the world of noir ( hardly any mystery here - mostly it 's suspense ) , but this one is solid . if anything , the simply 'okay ' plot has more to do with jim thompson 's writing than anything else . with thompson , plots are almost secondary ; he eschewed the labyrinthine tales of hammett and chandler for simpler stories with stronger , more confusing characters . look at a novel like the killer inside me and and you 'll see right away ( from the title ) what it 's all about . when it comes to thompson , it 's not what it 's about , it 's how it 's about it ( to quote roger ebert ) . so , really , the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and , if you do n't like it , well the jokes on you . why this is an 8star movie rather than a 10star one is because of the female lead . she 's not bad , per se , but she 's not angelica huston or anette benning ( see the adaptation of jim thompson 's the grifters if you do n't know what i 'm talking about - besides it 's a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir - it 's the best of the 1990s and challenges blood simple for the title of best since chinatown ) . she simply does n't have the chops ( or the looks for that matter ) and though she and patric have some chemistry , i do n't have it with her . so there .
i do n't think i 've really ever given walter matthau his due as a comedic performer . he 's certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles , but i guess i always put his success down to his characters ' grumpiness and ruthlessness , a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co-star jack lemmon , and , i suppose , a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures . watching gene saks ' 'the odd couple ( 1968 ) , ' adapted from a popular neil simon play , the realisation suddenly clicked : matthau is , in his own right , absolutely hilarious ! initially striking the audience as filthy , crude and generally unappealing , his oscar madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts , culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own . at the same time , while holding his own as a comedian , his interplay with lemmon is , of course , pitch-perfect ; indeed , the film rightly belongs to both actors , who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves , let alone together . calling to mind billy wilder 's screenplay for 'the apartment ( 1960 ) , ' this neil simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise . compulsive house-cleaner felix unger ( lemmon ) , having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years , attempts to commit suicide , but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window . dejected , he arrives at the house of good friend oscar ( matthau ) , a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches ( that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat ! ) . oscar kindly offers felix a place to stay , but is soon overwhelmed by his friend 's finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness . the pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement , with felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly-nagging wife , and oscar as the sloppy , unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he 's supposed to . this is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks , and , by the end of it , we can completely sympathise with felix 's ex-wife , who remains unseen . 'the odd couple ' is a terrific comedy , most of all because it has a lot of heart . for all their arguing , it 's obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other , most movingly seen when felix tries to launch into a furious tirade , instead  perhaps inadvertently  ending up informing oscar how `` tops '' he his . the pair 's four poker buddies ( john fiedler , herb edelman , david sheiner and larry haines ) are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance , but you ca n't deny that they 've got the best of intentions . their decision to treat felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory , but maybe being ignored was n't quite the correct solution to felix 's gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality . unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays { i was recently disappointed by wilder 's 'the seven year itch ( 1955 ) } , this film does n't simply strike at the same chord throughout , and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed , through tears , laughter and much disagreement .
pandora 's clock is among the best thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the best thrillers you will ever see . a highly faithful adaptation of john j. nance 's novel , which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel , is made even more so here . despite being made for tv , this is first rate entertainment . the cast is great and slips into characters from the novel so well that you would think they were reading the novel . richard dean anderson steps way outside the shadow of macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date . jane leeves is great her role as an ambassador 's assistant in a role that proves she can be a fine dramatic actor . daphne zuniga is great as dr. sanders and despite the character being a man in the book , it works incredibly well . robert loggia , edward herrmann , robert guillaume , and the rest of the supporting cast are top notch and fit their novel counterparts tot he letter . there are changes to the story of course ( including and a slight change in the ending ) but those changes are for the better when compared with the novel . the plot is realistic and very see to believe in the way its presented making this the best airplane set movie since the original airport movie . the production values are high and though the special effects might look as good as they did a decade or so ago , they work fine . sets are great , especially cia hq and the oval office showing that the filmmakers spent a lot of time to make this work . it does n't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa . just do both and you wo n't regret losing four hours to this film and however long it takes to read the novel . this will leave you breathless .
well , i thoroughly enjoyed this movie . it was funny and sad and yes , the guy andie macdowell shagged was hot . interesting , realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery . i think my mum would like it . i still think they should have been allowed to call it the sad f * * kers club though ...
let me get the bad out of the way first , james hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day . really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery . that said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes . i am an english guy from london but i love new york and have visited many many times before and after september 11th . it is a second home to me and i ca n't help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city . this is the real deal , in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them . i am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day . it is a shame that they did n't use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory , it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was . conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way .
108 : tarzan and his mate ( 1934 ) - released 4/20/1934 , viewed 8/6/08 . john dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in iowa . bonnie & clyde kill two highway patrolman in texas . births : ralph nader , gloria steinem , alan arkin , richard chamberlain . doug : after we were rather disappointed with the original 'tarzan the ape man , ' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film , 'tarzan and his mate , ' was the best in the series . it 's true . i got a huge kick out of this movie . johnny weismuller returns as the titular vine-swinging , animal dueling wild super-hero , and maureen o'sullivan reprises her role as his entirely fantastic lady love jane ( who sports a two-piece outfit for the first and last time here ) . in my review for 'ape man , ' i stomped on jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her incessant screaming , but she 's redeemed herself for me here . make no mistake : o'sullivan is the star of this movie , and jane is the most capable character in the entire cast . she acts as the ambassador between holt and tarzan , she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals , and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she 's out of bullets . she 's even got her own jungle scream now . the chemistry between johnny and maureen is irresistible . she 's totally got him trained . cheeta is quite charming as well , taking drags off of martin 's cigarette . the plot is mostly an excuse for tarzan to do battle with the jungle 's most vicious animals , especially lions , crocodiles , and rhinos . the effects , though always visible , are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely . oh , and you ca n't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene . all i can say is : yes , she is naked . very exciting stuff . kevin : wow . just wow . when it comes to down-and-dirty pre-code action/adventure , nothing holds a candle to 'tarzan and his mate . ' the inevitable sequel to tarzan the ape man is a kick-ass , violent and risqué jungle epic . i doubt there will be another tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does . you 'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be code-approved , or animal rights-approved for that matter . the gruesome violence does n't even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today 's adventure movies . and after t & j enter the picture , there 's plenty of early morning cuddling and ass-naked afternoon swims . see it for yourself if you do n't believe me . i love maureen o'sullivan most of all in this film . in the first film , jane seemed like a walking contradiction , like the writers back then just did n't know how to portray a character like that . but here she is a great precursor to kick-butt females of later cinema . although she still requires tarzan 's assistance in getting her out of most jams , she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued . her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living ( relatively ) comfortably in the jungle for a year . i watched this with my mom , and i enjoyed pointing out to her just how much jane has tarzan `` trained , '' as jeff foxworthy put it . she totally has the ape man at her every beck and call . although there is a host of dated optical effects throughout the film , there is still plenty of hair-raising tarzan vs. predator battles that are performed ( mostly ) for real . that and the men-dressed-as-apes are a lot more convincing this time around . * * spoiler * * the film climaxes as the jungle erupts with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves tarzan and jane the only two humans still breathing . although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and victorious , i ca n't help but imagine how this story will seem to the next safari who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find tarzan and jane and were never heard from again . * * end spoiler * * one of things that still bothers me is johnny weissmuller 's smooth , hairless bod and over-styled coif . other than that , this is pre-code action-adventure that is absolutely not to be missed . last film : it happened one night ( 1934 ) . next film : twentieth century ( 1934 ) .
domestic import was a great movie . i laughed the whole time . it was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations . the acting was great . alla korot , larry dorf , howard hesseman , and all the others did an awesome job . because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer , it does n't have the clichés that are expected of other comedies , which was such a relief . it was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-warming story . i heard it was based on a true story ? if so , then that is hilarious ( and amazing ! ) . i highly recommend this movie .
series three- blackadder the third `` if you want something done properly , kill baldrick before you start '' hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the prince regent , a vain and stupid foil for blackadders venom , played by hugh laurie . baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw . the format is similar to the previous show , after all now they had found the winning formula why change things . we see blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways , trying to make bladrick an m.p.or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince . in many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically , the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times . samuel johnson , william pit and wellington all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes , not an easy thing with such a stellar cast
it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be . its very underrated . people forgot what movies are really about , nowadays they only think about bum bum movies , which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends , like transformers , movies which are oriented , with hyper mega high budget like 300mln or even higher , on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline . its the kind of a movie what i despite most . of course it is fun watching greatly made cgis , but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of movies . i honestly think that performance was excellent . especially busy philipps , alongside with erika christensen and victor garber ( whom i respect ) made this movie an oscar worth . emotional performance by busy philipps was astonishing , its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands , which she deserves .
what more could i say ? the americans totally hated it because the u.s. cut was so bad , although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it . talking about the u.s. theatrical release ( along with the newly released blu-ray disc version ) , it 's faster and tighter than hk cut , the background musics were all changed from the dark , grim hk musics to hip-hop musics ; and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out . though , the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor 's voice and tone . but , the problem is hak hap ( black mask ) the movie was designed and meant to be dark , grim , super-disturbing and totally gruesome . very unfortunately the u.s. release just skimmed the cream they wanted , which in return completely changed the movie 's undertone ( hk release was rated 18+ ) to be even more comical and amateurish . now let 's talk about the original hk release . this movie is like a hidden gem , a prototype for the whole `` matrix '' tide and era . the fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit `` old-school '' among hk movies . however the style the movie created was a unique blend of kungfu and pop culture . with all the leather , black costumes and decorations , this movie features a batman-like superhero in a black mask against a run-of-the-mill gang of multinational super-soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss . yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child , but it works . it 's so impressive that the whole movie 's gon na give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats . in year 2002 they made a sequel which had a pg-13 rating , but without jet li and liu qing yun . and you know how bad that was because li and liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship . and , did i happen to mention francois yip ? her roundhouse kick was totally cool , even cooler than the villain boss because she did n't use a stuntman for all the fighting . did i mention she was also smoking hot ? anyway , there are a lot of things to like about the movie . however , the movie also suffered from a lot of problems . first off , it 's a mediocre script made at its best potential , which means this production team deserved a better screen-writer . there are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far-fetched and do n't totally make senses to the audiences ( us version was even worse because all the character developments were cut ) . anyway , you ca n't ask too much out of a comic-inspired action movie . also , this movie is entirely improper for children . i wo n't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old . it 's saturated with disturbing contents including blood , gore , sado-maso costumes , extreme brutal violence and so on . along with the style of the movie , it can be called a wet dream for heavy-metal rock music fans and action fans . ( the u.s. cut was milder , but if you want to see it , see the hk release for what it is . ) 7/10 . status : inspiring , hidden , undervalued , adult .
i can not accept the negative comments of other reviewers . they are too critical , perhaps because they are stuck in the past . i would like to see a comment from someone who had never seen basic instinct 1 , perhaps someone very young ? i left the cinema feeling glad that i had not been swayed by the imdb reviewers . 14 hours later i am still trying to find flaws in the plot but i can not think of anything serious . my advice to everyone is see it for yourself and make up your own mind . it follows a similar pattern to basic instinct 1 but the plot is less confused . it still left me wondering at the end but in a more satisfactory way . sharon stone is as sexy and evil as before and wears her 48 years extremely well ; this remains her defining role . david morrisey was satisfactory even though he is no michael douglas . of the supporting cast i particularly liked david thewlis as the police detective .
yet another remake of `` fistful of dollars '' , sergio leone 's remake of kurosawa 's `` yojimbo '' ( suggested by the novel 'red harvest ' ) . this one is strictly a b-movie ; taken as that , it is rather enjoyable . the direction is crisp , the acting full of verve , the limitations of its 'direct-to-video ' photography well-handled . the weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the 'fistful'/'yojimbo ' plot to a sub-plot from leone 's 'once upon a time in the west ' . although leone directed both 'fistful ' and 'west ' , his motivations behind the two films could n't be anymore different . the 'man with no name ' ( eastwood ) is a borderline socio-path with a soft spot for broken families . harmonica ( chaeles bronson ) is obsessed with his own broken family , and obsessed with revenge . these two characters would not have had much to do with each other . in order to bring them together , 'gun crazy ' has to twist it 's plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we 're actually following . but this is a b-movie after all , and filled with action and silliness ; it 's entertaining on that level , just do n't expect anything more .
i love this movie . director michael powell once stated that this was his favorite movie , and it is mine as well . powell and pressburger created a seemingly simple , superbly crafted story - the power of love against `` the powers that be '' . however , its deception lies in the complexity of its `` is it real or is it imaginary '' premise . basically , one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young , poetically inclined airman during wwii . or is it ? the question is never answered one way or the other . actually , it is never even asked . this continuous understatement is part of the film 's appeal . the innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers . for instance , pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of richard strauss ' opera , der rosenkavalier , about a young 18th century viennese aristocrat . this is evident in the brief interlude in which conductor 71 , dressed in all his finery , holds the rose ( which appears silver in heaven ) . the music even has a dreamy quality . all of the acting is first rate - david niven is at his most charming , and he has excellent support from veteran roger livesey and relative newcomer kim hunter . but , in my opinion , the film 's charm comes from marius goring as conductor 71 . he by far has the most interesting role , filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness , brightening the film . it 's a pity that some of conductor 71 's scenes were left on the cutting room floor . it is also a pity that goring 's comedic talents are rarely seen again on film , except in the wonderful videos of the scarlet pimpernel television series from the 1950s . this is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career . he is a perfect foil for relaxed style of niven , and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters . ironically , also in the mid -1940s , niven also starred against another heavenly `` messenger '' , played by cary grant , in the bishop 's wife . their acting styles were so similar that i found the result boring , unenergetic , and disappointing . as a note , according to powell , goring desperately wanted the role of peter carter , initially refusing conductor 71 . it 's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal . the movie , `` commissioned '' to smooth over the strained relations between britain and the u.s. , overdrives its point towards the end . but it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war - the numerous casualties , both military and civilian , the need to `` go on '' when faced with death . there is a conspicuous lack of wwii `` enemies '' in heaven , but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin . powell and pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it was n't necessary . the movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for , but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the atlantic .
some of those guys that watch films and complain about them for a living are forgetting something : dvd menu system . i tell you the people , i watched the main screen repeat in this one about 35 times . it was awesome . a cinematic tapestry of cascading brilliance that had me from where it was , which was the very beginning . many times the sum and bam ! i was hooked . over and over and over . and over . `` doot de doot , de doo de dodedo . '' and that 's just the soundtrack ! i is laid aside in the bed , curled up with my vaio . the rain is in the flat roof and tonight soft is again soft . the cat is comfortable and my ankle which crosses in me , is already rested . i popped in the dvd . i was mesmerized . through the night . `` doot de doot , de doo de dodedo . '' the blob . see it . steve queen , two cops , and one girl in a dress . two thumbs way up !
i found this movie thought-provoking , and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of quick-fix films where we are manipulated into loving the `` good guy '' and hating the `` bad guy . '' scott cohen , a very handsome television actor , does a great job of portraying the family black sheep/lost child who aspires to gain his father 's love and respect , as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a history . judd hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected . when i saw this at the tribeca film festival , i was enchanted by the lovely way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition , as explained by the director . this is a fitting successor to the classic `` ordinary people . '' i just realized , judd hirsch was in that , too !
`` the haunted world of edward d. wood , jr. '' is the definitive documentary on the life of the man who brought us such movies as `` glen or glenda '' , `` bride of the monster '' , and , of course , `` plan 9 from outer space '' . this exquisite film far exceeds where other documentaries , such as `` look back in angora '' and `` the plan 9 companion '' , failed . it rounds up his surviving entourage , many of whom have passed away since filming , and gives an honest examination of ed wood and his work . nostalgic in the fact that it looks back at the darker corner of yesteryear hollywood , sentimental in its treatment of the director ( down to the haunting music ) , this documentary is an absolute must-see for anyone who loves the director who so failed in his day . the entire two hours of the film lovingly and retrospectively pieces together ed 's life and untimely death for the viewer . best watched at 3 am while wearing an angora sweater .
to be fair , i expected car chases in this film . there was only really one , but apart from that , 'freeway ' was a great movie which i am glad to own on dvd . the only really big names in the cast are homicide 's richard belzer as the radio psychiatrist and b-movie villain par-excellance billy drago as the revelation-quoting freeway killer . but the rest of the cast generally give good performances . i especially liked how darlanne fluegel gave her character , sunny , a bit of guts . she could have been a helpless victim character but she is fully rounded as she seeks out drago with the help of bounty hunter james russo . russo , i 'm afraid , comes across as rather wooden , but then again , the character he plays , frank , is n't very well fleshed out save for a back story sunny is given by his former commanding officer . the tone of menace is kept up superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely la freeway at night with the killer prowling its ' length in his sinister grey sedan is an excellent way of building tension , and the music used to underscore the film is suitably composed . i do n't know why there are some people who hate this movie so . different strokes for different folks , i suppose . but i absolutely enjoyed 'freeway ' and i can strongly recommend it .
i grew up watching this series . i was about seven/eight years old when it was on . i still remember the 1st episode which was called `` the new house . '' it scared the h * ll out of me ! i can almost still hear that statue , laughing madly . and the ending , oh my god ! the hooror spirit comes in the room for the child : yikes ! this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series . i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet : 2 actually . my question to any readers : has anyone purchased this set ? its a bootleg . both sellers claim to have very good copy . i have a sketchy and poor dvd of `` the new house '' episode , and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better , however , if anyone knows if these are much clearer it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids . a great series , clever , scary and daringly supernatural . thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this- in fact , i 'd love to discuss it . chris walker
i know that you 've already entered this in film festivals ( or at least i think you have , i may just be making that up ) but i think this should get `` best animated short film '' in every one . bravo . i ca n't wait for the full film . i realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations , but hear it now and accept it as the truth . kudos , my friend . okay , now i 'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... though i still mean it . and here comes yet another -shoe ! - and i can not stop here yet . this is extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing better to do . in fact , i 'll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic `` jason steele marathon . '' i do have a lot of those . -r
lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids . that depends on the kid . this is n't a movie for a 2-6 year old ; it 's more geared toward the 8 years and older crowd . i saw this movie when i was 10 , i absolutely loved it . at the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes . this movie deals with more serious issues , and therefore has a little more emotional impact . in this movie characters can die , and be sent to hell ! this gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives . the good guys are n't always perfectly sweet and nice ( like other cartoons ) . they have `` real '' motivations , like revenge , and greed , but also compassion and friendship ; shows that things are n't always black and white . excellent movie
i got this film about a month ago and i am now a fanatic fan of drew barrymore 's . i love a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant one with the truths of red sox slotted in ! it 's about a maths teacher who takes some promising kids on a maths trip to a company where the successful lindsey ( drew ) shows them some information . this then leads in the ben ( teacher ) and lindsey dating . but it is n't all simple when he confesses he is a massive red sox fan . first of all things are fine but then his baseball gets in the way of lindseys life . it 's all fine in the end and it took one shot to get drew running across the field ! ! i got it for two quid in blockbusters so i was happy . if you like films like this i suggest you see some more of drew 's work like charlie 's angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with hugh grant in called music and lyrics .
lorna green ( janine reynaud ) is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club . she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon . it 's quite possible that , through a form of hypnotic suggestion , someone ( .. a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet ) is guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin . after the murders within her fantasies are committed , lorna awakens bewildered , often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality . if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco , i 'd say it 's elegant & difficult . by now , you 've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about , since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream . franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career , as far as film-making style , and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience . and , as you read from the reaction of the user comments here .. some like this decision , others find the style labouring , dull , and bewildering . i 'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head , but even franco himself , when quizzed by critics who watched `` succubus '' , admitted that he did n't even understand the film and he directed it ! some might say that `` succubus '' was merely a precursor to his more admired work , `` venus in furs '' , considered his masterwork by franco-faithful , because it also adopts the surreal , dreamlike structure where the protagonist does n't truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined . in a sense , like the protagonist , we are experiencing the same type of confusion .. certainly , `` succubus '' is unconventional film-making where we are n't given the keys to what is exactly going on . and , a great deal of the elusive dialogue does n't help matters . `` succubus '' is also populated by beatnik types and `` poet-speak '' , corman 's film , `` a bucket of blood '' poked fun at . my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party .. quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually . great locations and jazz score .. i liked this film myself , although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction . loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna , a wee bit drunk , writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig ( .. equally wasted ) rush her in an embrace of kisses .
i first saw this movie when it came out in 1994 and just watched it recently and it is still funny . i do n't know if you have to understand hiphop in the 90 's , but it helps if you do . in the 90 's when nwa and public enemy were at the top , there were internal strife within the groups and members when their separated ways ( ice cube , easy e , etc ) . also there were the wan na b 's , accessible rappers that start making the scene ( vanilla ice , freedom williams from c & c music factory , etc ) . this movie makes fun of all of that in a way that seems like it 's an actually documentary . kasi lemmons plays an interviewer that spends a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name n.w.h . the members of the group are ice code ( rusty condieff/director ) , tasty taste ( larry b scott/revenge of the nerds , and tone def ( mark christopher lawrence ) . they are an up and coming rap group whose politics makes them controversial . whats good about this film is that it is so thourough in its portrayal of the hiphop industry of the 80s and they way it pokes fun at it . but , if you know 80's/90 's rap , you know how much of this stuff is true . still , on it 's own , without hip hop knowledge , it is still a funny funny movie . and for all of those who ask , yes spinal tap came first , but spinal tap is not the first spoof movie either . this , in my opinion is equally as funny and in some ways , better than spinal tap . as spinal tap is to heavy metal , fear of a black planet is to rap . and the songs are off the hook also . the dvd is chalk full of extras to include music videos of nwh as a group and as solo artists . brilliant performances by rusty condieff and larry b scott .
here 's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by eytan fox . the movie presents the story of star-crossed lovers ( one israeli , one palestinian ) in modern tel aviv . the film 's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross-ethnic conflict , but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well . for example , there 's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters , openly gay , is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family , and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room . clearly the young man is not as open as he seems , and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be , while the boyfriend is confused and rejected . a good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment . as we know from yossi & jagger , fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences . the film is also effective for the even-handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that israelies and palestinians inflict on each other . if you 're not heartless , you 'll cry through the last third of the movie . though the plot is melodramatic , it 's so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be .
in the year 1985 ( my birth year ) steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young african-american girl celie ( debut role for whoopi goldberg ) whose life is followed through rough times . the story begins from the year 1909 when celie is only 14 years old . she has given birth two children for her father . celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable . a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him . it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling . women are inferior of men and especially being an african-american woman their rights are less than a zero . celie 's story is a true survival story . `` the color purple '' is a master-piece and underestimated film of spielberg . he should make more drama which `` the color purple '' and `` schindler 's list '' are good notion . the cast is amazing . whoopi goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama . danny glover was surprisingly nasty `` mister '' . i have never seen him in a such an evil role . the talk-show icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed sofia . warning ! prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film . you can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood . especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sister . big applauds to mr. spielberg !
this is one of those rare movies , it 's lovely and compelling , dignified and quirky , a true gift . i consider it a prerequisite for any trip to italy , or any vacation at all , because it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience ( yup , find the magic ) . i especially loved josie lawrence , as lottie wilkins , but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film . further the costumes , if you 're drawn to fashion and costumes , are extraordinarily well done . i just wish they 'd release it on dvd because i 'm wearing my tape version out ! absolutely well worth your time , just make sure to settle in to watch it , without any interruptions .
der todesking is not one of my favorite jorg buttgereit film - but still is an interesting film dealing with suicide and it 's reasons and ramifications . those looking for a gore-fest , or exploitation in the style of the nekromantik films or schramm will probably be disappointed . der todesking is definitely an `` art-house '' style film , so those that need linear , explainable narratives need not apply ... the basic concept of der todesking is that there is an `` episode '' for each day of the week that revolves around a strange chain letter that apparently causes people to commit suicide , interspersed with scenes of a slowly decomposing corpse ... there are some very well done and thought provoking scenes , including the man talking about the `` problems '' with his wife , and the concert massacre ( which unfortunately lost some of it 's `` power '' on me , because i was too busy laughing at the scorpions look-alike band on stage ... ) . but seriously - this is a sometimes beautiful ( the scene that shows different angles of that huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance of the scene , and that the names shown are of people that actually committed suicide from jumping from the bridge ... ) , sometimes confusing , sometimes silly ( the she wolf of the ss rip-off is pretty amusing ) , sometimes harrowing ( i found the scene of the guy talking to the girl in the park about his wife particularly effective ) film that is more of an `` experience '' then just entertainment , as many of these `` art '' films are meant to be . still , i did n't find der todesking to be as strong as nekromantik or schramm , and would probably put it on relatively even footing with nekromantik 2 in terms of my personally `` enjoyment level '' . definitely worth a look to any buttgereit or `` art '' film fan . if you dig this type of film - check out subconscious cruelty - in my opinion the best art-house/horror film that i 've seen . 7/10 for der todesking
a lovely old - fashioned thriller coming on like a cross between alfred hitchcock and david lynch , '' red rock west '' follows the misadventures of injured veteran unemployed oil worker mr n.cage as his luck turns from bad to worse after he ends up with an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in a one ute town in the back of beyond . it has been established right from the start that mr cage might be down but he is not out , and he might be broke but he will not steal , not even in his present dire circumstances.consequently when he is mistaken by mr j.t . walsh for the man he has commissioned to murder his wife , mr cage calls on the wife to warn her of her husband 's intentions.in turn she , in the person of miss l.f.boyle , offers him even more money to murder mr walsh.mr cage decides to leave whilst he is still in front but as he is driving out of town he hits a man in the road.tempted as he might be to drive on , he takes the man to hospital , where it turns out he has been shot.mr cage is detained by the deputies who call the sheriff who turns out to be mr j.t.walsh . events take a further complicated turn when , escaping from custody , mr.cage narrowly avoids being run over by the real hit-man on his way to fulfill his commission.about now you might be forgiven for thinking `` enough already '' , but as it happens on the screen it seems a completely logical turn of events , the narrative flow of the movie at this point seeming unstoppable . mr d.hopper is comfortably cast as the hired killer , like mr cage a usmc veteran.this little piece of serendipity keeps mr cage alive long enough out-think the murderous trio and survive , a little more battered but still unbowed . it is a tribute to everybody involved that what sounds on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is in fact a tense exceptionally well made picture with fine performances all round . `` red rock west '' is a movie - lover 's movie.within five minutes you know you are going somewhere you 've been before on plenty of occasions , but you 'll be very happy during the trip .
a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches .... people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear . also , alas , an ending that comes out of nowhere , because , apparently , the auteur has lost interest in the movie , or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot .
when the grinch came out i was excited though i thought it was going to be a happy go lucky film and it was . though it did have a little nightmare before christmas touch to it . you know kind of dark and spooky . i loved this film because it helped fill people with the christmas spirit . so mostly the grinch saved christmas . and what happened then well in whoville they say that the grinch 's small heart grew three sizes that day . merry grinchmas !
i 've read a number of reviews on this film and i have to say `` what is wrong with you people ? ! ? ! '' this was an excellent film ! i thought this film was superb from start to finish and the story was extremely well told . i 'm convinced that the people that did n't like this film were n't paying very good attention to the film . there are a number of very important scenes that if you are n't paying attention you will be confused and the following scenes may not make sense . i urge anyone who did n't like this film to watch it again and watch it alone so that you can truly pay attention . the story made perfect sense to me and as i said , was very well told . every scene in the film has a point and everything fits together at the end of the film . all the actors did a fantastic job ! sean connery was very good in his role as always . laurence fishburne was superb as tanny brown , playing a very interesting character . kate capshaw was a nice touch as well , and looks fantastic . blair underwood was a pleasant surprise , i did n't really expect anything great from him , but he pulled off a great performance . ed harris was the real gem in the film . he plays a truly sick individual and really makes you see how disturbed his character is . watch his eyes in his scenes , just superb ! ! ! also , there is a very young scarlett johansson ( as kate ) in one of her first roles ... not a bad place to start . excellent cast in this film ! i would strongly recommend this film to anyone that likes any of the cast members or just likes thrillers . this is a great film and should be seen . do n't listen all these other people 's opinions , go see the movie and come to your own conclusions . i hope that you will see the film , and i hope that you enjoy it as much as i do . thanks for reading , -chris
frankie dio ( lee vancleef ) is a high-ranking mobster who turns himself in to the police or illegal gambling ( for reasons that seem unclear to me ) . tony ( tony lo bianco ) is a low-level thug who frequents a pool hall and spends his free time envying frankie . by being in the right place at the right time , tony gets arrested with frankie and is sent to jail ... where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship , but it will do for now . this film came to me under the title of `` frank and tony '' , which is disappointing because i see an alternate name is `` mean frank and crazy tony '' , which would have helped sell the film more effectively . i presume that 's an homage to `` dirty mary , crazy larry '' but what do i know ? i watched it shortly after another italian crime film , `` violent professionals '' , and i must say the two complement each other very well . italians have always lagged behind americans in their budgets and production values , which is a real shame with this film . it is considered a `` grindhouse '' film , which unfairly demotes it to a b-movie ( or worse ) . with a cleaner sound and picture , this could have been a hollywood hit , i suspect . i found the story very interesting , the characters ( and actors ) better than average and unlike `` violent professionals '' the plot is fairly clear -- not too many secondary characters . if you like mafia movies or crime films you should give this one a try . a film about the mob that 's actually from italy ( how much more authentic do you want ? ) is as much as you can ask . sure , it 's not `` the godfather '' , but it 's not supposed to be . this is n't a drama , it 's a light comedy , heavy action buddy film ... like `` die hard with a vengeance '' from the point of view of the bad guys . well , okay , not really . if nothing else , this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast . films besides `` escape from new york '' ( where vancleef plays `` hauk '' ) and the usual cult movies . what 's more fun than discovering a lost classic ?
even though this movie came out a year before i was born , it is definetely one of my favorite comedies . it stars redd foxx as a father who tries to understand his son 's homosexuality . like most parents , he does n't know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like . his son , norman , is now grown up and living on his own . when his father , ben , finds out that his son is gay , he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him . the title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie -- when ben gets to norman 's apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it 's his son in drag ( `` norman ... is that you ? '' ) . the movie had me laughing from start to finish . redd foxx is great . although a lot of the content is stereotypical , i did n't find anything offensive about the way the material was handled , and it even has a good ending . highly recommended .
i researched this film a little and discovered a web site that claims it was actually an inside joke about the post wwii greenwich village world of gays and lesbians . with the exception of stewart and novak , the warlocks and witches represented that alternative lifestyle . john van druten who wrote the stage play was apparently gay and very familiar with this greenwich village . i thought this was ironic because i first saw bell , book and candle in the theater when i was in 5th or 6th grade just because my parents took me . it was hard to get me to a movie that did n't include horses , machine guns , or alien monsters and i planned on being bored . but , i remember the moment when jimmy stewart embraced kim novak on the top of the flatiron building and flung his hat away while the camera followed it fluttering to the ground . as the glorious george duning love theme soared , i suddenly got a sense of what it felt like to fall in love . the first stirrings of romantic/sexual love left me dazed as i left the theater . i am sure i 'm not the only pre-adolescent boy who was seduced by kim novak 's startling , direct gaze . it 's ironic that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty in so many of us . i am in my late 50 's now and re-watched the film yesterday evening and those same feelings stirred as i watched that hat touch down fifty years later . . .
a true hero of modern times , chuck norris has left tv `` walker , rexas ranger `` , and is looking new steps for his artistic career . the president´s man is the second movie of a future tv series , with norris in the title role , and with young actors like jennifer tung or judson mills ( one of the young rangers of `` walker `` ) . the old master teachs to young aspirant . it´s one of the most powerful themes of `` the president´s man `` . in this tima , `` a line in the sand `` has reached world surprise for his tratment of terrorism in usa , months before the tragic september 11 . eric norris , son of chuck is the director . the movie is amusing , a good action work , plenty of fights and heroism . chuck norris have many plans for the future . bells of innocence , his next picture , will be the following .
i remember seeing this film at the west end theater in louisville , kentucky when i was a boy . the scene where dr. carmus finds the gardener 's coffin , and the breathing dead body therein , was the scariest part of the movie for me , only intensified by the darkness of the film . i also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end , until i recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the blackwoods was changed from blackblood , due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people . sir thomas blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family . i also noticed that as foster first enters the gate of the cemetery , he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate , where he meets his end . i would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers .
in france , it 's considered polite from french critics to genuflect to the apparently cohesive chain of films brian de palma left behind him . however , a good proportion of his films are marred by bombastic effects `` carrie '' ( 1976 ) , `` the fury '' ( 1978 ) `` scarface '' ( 1983 ) without mentioning his borrowings from hitchcock . here , in `` dressed to kill '' , it 's impossible not to think of `` vertigo '' ( 1958 ) for the long sequence in the museum while the key moment in the lift makes inevitably think of the shower anthology sequence in `` psycho '' ( 1960 ) . about our involved film , i do n't want to revive the old debate : does de palma rip off hitchcock ? instead , i would tend to be generous and to classify `` dressed to kill '' in the category of de palma 's winners alongside `` sisters '' ( 1973 ) and `` obssession '' ( 1976 ) . with however some reservations and they 're the ones i previously enumerated which fuel the bickering between de palma 's rabid fans and his detractors . if there 's one sure thing in `` dressed to kill '' which can generate general agreement among film-lovers , it 's de palma 's virtuosity in directing . he wields his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do . his sophisticated camera work brilliantly fuels the suspense which entails a rise of the tension and a discomforting aura . the audience is easily glued in front of the screen . this is helped by the use of several long silent sequences during which everything depends on looks and gestures . by the way , in `` psycho '' , there were also long silent , suspenseful parts ... but the main drawback in de palma 's 1980 vintage is that the quality of the plot ca n't be found wanting and appears to be a rehash of many formulaic , corny ingredients pertaining to an incalculable number of murder stories . the prostitute is the sole witness of the crime . then , she 's suspected by the police and has to act on her own ( with a little help from the victim 's son from the scene in the subway onwards ) ) to track down the murderer and to prove her innocence . apart from the fact that de palma uses a type of character who for once is n't demeaned at all , it 's a menu which smells the reheated . and the filmmaker ends his film on a sequence that echoes to the opening one . yes , it 's superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function , one figures : `` it 's almost gratuitous filler '' . perhaps de palma wanted to stretch his film beyond one hour and a half when at this time the viewer knows ( and even before ) who the killer is . the two central mainsprings in de palma 's set of themes articulate hinges on manipulation and voyeurism . the latter theme is well present in `` dressed to kill '' from the first scene onwards which makes the film almost look like a soft porn movie . and the filmmaker is n't afraid to film his main actress and wife nancy allen in her underwear . i find his approach about this theme rather doubtful . but maybe the first sequence was conceived to be a mirror of the viewer and de palma wanted to stir his peeping tom side . i do n't want to demean at all de palma 's work . his prestigious work in directing which entails a communicative treat to film redeems the global weakness of the story and its doubtful aspects . twenty six years after , the controversy he aroused amid movie-goers is n't ready to subside .
wow what an episode ! after last week seeing mellisa constantly making cameos about the friendship of annie and brandi i almost puked . but that was nothing until seeing mellisa 's tirade after being fired . seeing her hobble around on her cast spewing out obscenities and screaming for someone to get her purse was absolutely the most hilarious thing ever on reality tv . she continued to scream at people off set to get her clothes `` all of them '' like someone else would wear one of her hideous outfits . mellisa you are like 40 years old and you still throw temper tantrums ? then joan starts calling annie and brandie every name in the book , and gets up and quits the show ! both rivers are spoiled brats who were only left on the show this long to keep ratings up . mellisa crying and refusing to do an exit interview , just proves to america what everyone thought , you are a spoiled baby . wah wah i ca n't get my way ! i love how annie told the cameras she could manipulate mellisa to think her way , and then did exactly that . mellisa is by far the smartest contestant and clearly deserves to win the whole game .
hmmmm , want a little romance with your mystery ? this has it . i think if the romance was ditched this would have made for a better movie . but how could the romance be ditched when the story 's borrowed from something called a harlequin romance novel , whatever the heck that is . had the romance been ditched , the story might have been a little too weak . the mystery here was n't too bad , quite interesting but nothing on the level of mission impossible international espionage . oh well . i thought mel harris was pretty good ; her short skirts , i think , added some sex appeal ... but this rob stewart guy probably could have been better cast , maybe with a more well known tv movie actor . the directing was decent and the writing could have been improved on - both could have been a little edgier , a little darker , more adventurous . one thing that was great about this was the use of real european locations . that could easily have been changed so this could have been filmed in canada but they really were in magnificently beautiful places like budapest . possibly a drawback was the director and/or cinematographer 's choice to frame certain shots picture postcard perfect . not good . had this been a more dramatic motion picture shot for the big screen , picture postcard perfect scenes really need to take a backseat and just be a nice part of the background . this was just a tv-movie , though , so they had to add some ummmph to the picture and some of that ummmph came from the scenery . overall , twas n't really a bad movie . i 'll tell you what , this was absolutely the best canadian-hungarian production i have ever seen ! ( and the only that i know of . ) i hereby proclaim this to be a mediocre made-for-tv movie , giving it a grade of c-
robert stack never really got over losing a best supporting actor oscar for his role as kyle in `` written on the wind '' to anthony quinn 's 12-minute performance in `` lust for life . '' stack plays the deeply disturbed , alcoholic son of an oil tycoon . he has lived his life in the shadow of the friend with whom he was raised , mitch , played by rock hudson . they both love the same woman , lucy , ( lauren bacall ) , who becomes kyle 's wife . kyle 's sister , marylee ( dorothy malone ) , is a drunken slut who 's in love with mitch . their story plays out in glorious color under the able direction of douglas sirk , who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible films , including `` imitation of life , '' `` all that heaven allows , '' `` magnificent obsession , '' and many others . make no mistake - this is a potboiler , and stack and dorothy malone make the most of their roles , malone winning a best supporting actress oscar . there 's one amazing scene , mentioned in other comments , where she wildly dances to loud music as her father collapses and dies on the staircase . we 're led to believe that marylee sleeps with everyone , including the guy that pumps the gas , because she 's in love with mitch . mitch wants nothing to do with her . he 's so in love with lucy that , out of loyalty to kyle , he wants to go to work in iran to avoid temptation . i doubt he 'd be so anxious to get there today no matter how much in love he was . hudson and bacall have the less exciting roles here - hudson 's mitch is the good guy who 's been cleaning up kyle 's messes for his entire life , and bacall is mitch 's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of sobriety . sirk focuses on the more volatile supporting players . in sirk 's hands , `` written on the wind '' is an effective film , and the big scene toward the end in the mansion is particularly exciting . the director had a gift for this type of movie , and though he had many imitators , he never had an equal .
now i 've always been a fan of full moon 's puppet work . but i have to say that robot jox is one of there better projects . yes , you heard me . the story works wonderful , the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first rate job . gary graham who really makes his mark on tv in shows like alien nation the series and star trek enterprise shows that he can be an action star who kicks ass and takes name . the stop motion effects could have been a tiny bit better . the color was wrong , they look plastic to me instead of the metal they were suppose to be . but that is a minor complaint compared to the whole that is the robot jox , if you like gary graham or other full moon movies , then you will like this movie . 9 stars out of 10 .
`` the last wave '' is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind . the title refers to the aboriginal doomsday theory : there will be one last wave that wipes out everything . david burton ( richard chamberlain ) is a sydney lawyer hired to defend some aborigines accused of murder . around this time , there has been unusually heavy rainfall in australia . while defending the aborigines , david learns the last wave theory , and begins to wonder whether it 's just mythology . the movie 's last sequence is a metaphor for descending into the depths of one 's mind . peter weir created a perplexing , but thought-provoking , movie . aboriginal actor david gulpilil ( whom you may have seen in `` walkabout '' , `` crocodile dundee '' and `` rabbit-proof fence '' ) provides an interesting supporting role as one of the defendants . if you get a chance , watch the `` making of '' feature on the dvd . peter weir explains some of the film 's undertones , some of which relate to richard chamberlain 's background .
whilst it is universally acknowledged that fearful symmetry was heavily influenced by the kolchak episode they have been , they are , they will be , whether this makes it a rip-off or a homage is an altogether more controversial point . as a huge fan of both series i subscribe to the latter belief , although the less charitable may not do . james whitmore was brave to take on the task of directing such a difficult episode , invisible elephants and gorilla suits sounds like a recipe for disaster , but he pulls it off with style , the teaser being an absolute gem . lance guest does a great job of making a credible character out of kyle lang and jack rader seethes with menace as ed meecham . forget fearful symmetry 's dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying x file .
sudden impact tends to be treated as eastwood 's artistic failure at a point in his career when he had established a good reputation as a director . the reason is actually not the film itself but the attitude it takes towards vigilantism which it seems to support . in some places it actually owes more to death wish than the original dirty harry film . one might argue if that is so- at the end of the day it 's a film about guilt , justice and retribution . for me , at the end of the day it 's more empathy than sympathy . however , in view of all these arguments it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is an awfully well made film . forget the `` go ahead punk , make my day scene '' , that 's iconic but not original . but look at the views of san fransisco taken from the air , zooming in on the city . the first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular . or have a look at the brilliantly made scene where sondra locke 's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital . eastwood makes great use of the juxtaposition of faces . so all in all sudden impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature eastwood is as a director . and if i remember correctly it was actually the first time eastwood put that on screen albeit in an action film of debatable ideology . also , i think this is the first well paced film eastwood directed . although eastwood has enormous talent as a director , dramaturgy has always been his weak point ( see play misty for me , breezy etc . ) thepace of the narrative leads to the visual elements being well integrated into the film and not distracting from the story . the only thing that is really annoying is the farting dog .
when i was a kid it was lex barker 's time as tarzan . i often heard from older people that johnny weissmuller `` was '' tarzan and i would n't understand why since i saw a couple of weismuller 's last films in the character and i thought he was sort of out of shape . it was n't after many years that i came across `` tarzan and his mate '' , and then i understood . weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other tarzans such as barker , gordon scott , jock mahoney , denny miller , miles o'keefe and cristopher lambert . as for this film i was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful maureen o'sullivan a strong , self minded , active and `` no-inhibitions '' woman as jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made ( tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused ; one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she does n't kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it ) ; such behaviors were unthinkable with the `` janes '' to come such as brenda joyce , vanessa brown , virginia huston or dorothy hart , all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the african jungle . o'sullivan character 's sparkling personality steals the show out of tarzan himself , except of course when it comes to action and weismuller takes the lead easily ; the combination is perfect . another highlight in the movie is cheeta 's secondary role and not as the main lead like in later tarzan pictures where she often saves the day . `` tarzan and his mate '' stands as a fine product in its genre ( tarzan films ) and perhaps as the best , though i have to admit that i also enjoyed `` tarzan 's greatest adventure '' ( 1959 ) made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast ( and in spite of the just acceptable gordon scott in the leading role with his too perfect `` all gymnasium '' physical looks that does n't fit for a rustic ape man ) . good for jane and her mate !
honestly , this is the best reality show anyone has ever come up with . in order to win the money you have to actually be intelligent . not only that you 've got to be brave , athletic , cunning , etc . it actually requires skill . not like some lame-ass shows that are on these days . and yet , they only have two seasons of it ! bull .. they need to bring this show back ! ! although , they 'll have a hard time pulling anderson cooper away from cnn . he was great . but seriously , it was an amazing show . you never knew who would be going when . and it was so much fun trying to figure out the mole yourself ! it was a show you could actually play yourself if you wanted to ! bring back the mole ! ! ! ! bring back the mole ! ! ! !
i saw this film in a london cinema in 1975 and have not seen it since . i found it hilarious . i loved it 's originality . it 's rare that someone makes a movie like this - and it 's sad too . what i mean is , i once read a book called `` the black hotel '' - and as a film-fan , i always `` picture '' books as films . kinda `` adapt '' them , you know ? but as i read it , i thought , well , this would make a great movie - but of course it would have to be `` adapted '' - to the point where it would bear little relationship to the book . but then i thought , well why ? sure , it could never be shown on sunday afternoon tv , but provided it were shown in cinemas to adults , who knew what it contained , where 's the harm ? dammit , my civil liberties were being crushed here . a director should be able to make a literal film adaptation of `` the black hotel '' . in an ideal world , censorship of films for adults should not exist . but sadly , whilst i accept that with intelligent adults , such freedom might be harmless , there would always be those who would lack the rationality to differentiate between fantasy and reality , and who might be spurred on to commit foul deeds . however , it 's hard to see how `` la bete '' falls into that category . on it 's appearance in england , the british censor dismissed it out of hand . despite the '69 relaxation on nudity , given the film 's theoretical theme of bestiality , had the censor passed any of it , he 'd have been looking for a new job on monday . but ... in those days , there was an alternative . the g.l.c . this was a local town council with a department who had the power to pass a film just for london , where it was deemed audiences were more `` sopisticated '' than those who lived out in the sticks . the film was duly submitted and passed . however , it later emerged that the `` board '' consisted of just four people - three who voted , plus a `` chairman '' . and on the day , one of the voters was off sick . thus the remaining two voters and the chairman sat down to view `` la bete '' . one of said voters thought , like me , that the film was hilarious and hardly likely to encourage foul deeds by anyone . the other lacked imagination and simply thought the piece disgusting . and the chairman did n't understand it , so decided to err on the side of freedom . when the missing voter finally saw the film , they too thought it disgusting , but it was too late ! the film had received its `` x-london '' certificate and opened to mixed reaction . the g.l.c . film censorship board was disbanded soon after ! thus `` la bete '' only opened in london by what could best be termed a fluke ! but i 'm glad it was . it 's great ! if you have n't seen it , do so . it 's a fantasy , and as such , it 's far less disturbing than most things you see on the news these days ...
the only complaint i have about this adaptation is that it is sexed-up . things that were only hinted at in the novel are shown on-screen for some weird reason . did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they were not shown everything out-right ? other than that , this is very good-quality . all the actors do marvelous jobs bringing their characters to life . for the shallow women out there , it 's worth watching at least because toby stephens as gilbert is the sexiest thing ever . if i were helen i would have conveniently forgotten i was still married the minute i laid eyes on him ... sort of a spoiler- the ending scene is a funny reversal of what happened in the book .
there are few movies that appear to provide enterntainment as well as realism . if you 've ever wondered about the role of snipers in modern war , take a look at this one . i just loved the scene where hundred soldiers get shooting at the jungle , no-one quite sure where that shot came ? and , they nicked one scene to saving private ryan , so it has to have some merit in the scene .
i have seen this film on countless occasions , and thoroughly enjoyed it each time . this is mostly due to the lovely erika eleniak- a great actress with incredible looks . plus , any film starring tom berenger and dennis hopper is bound to be entertaining .
brokedown palace is truly a one of a kind . it 's an amazing story , showing two girl 's plight for freedom against the thailand justice system . they soon find themselves placing faith into a system they know nothing about . alice morano ( claire danes ) and darlene davis ( kate beckinsale ) , are two best friends , strait out of high school . they suddenly change their vacation plans from hawaii to thailand , and are immediately captivated by a young man , nick parks . he flirts with them both , and suggests that the three of them go to hong kong for the weekend . when the two arrive at the airport , they are immediately searched for drugs . someone tipped off customs , and in an instant , their life is changed forever . in the mix of the confusion of settling into their new life , they learn about a highly respected lawyer , named hank green ( bill pullman ) . an american who knows the thai justice system , he fights for the girl to be free . but they soon find out , when they leave or go is all up to them . if you 're looking for a great movie that 'll stay with you for years - brokedown palace is definitely the way to go .
the ogre does n't seem to have won itself a very good reputation since its release in 1988 , and i guess a reason for that may be down to the fact that it was given the subtitle 'demons 3 ' in order to help it sell better . well , the film is directed by lamberto bava ; the man behind the first two demons films , and ogres and demons are somewhat alike ( in that they 're both 'monsters ' anyway ) ... but other than that , this film has no connections to the other two films . it is , however , rather good ! italian filmmakers are famous for ripping off popular films , and while it 's not completely obvious ; it seems to me that this one has taken a fair bit of influence from hellraiser . the plot focuses on a female horror writer who moves with her husband and son to a castle in italy . she is haunted by memories from when she was a child and found an ogre living in her basement . it 's not long after moving into the castle before these visions return ... and it may be more than just a coincidence as she comes to believe there 's a murderous ogre living in the basement . the film was obviously shot on a budget and it was made for italian tv , so it would be unrealistic to expect something brilliant ; but for what it is , this is certainly a very decent horror film . lamberto bava may not have as keen an eye as his father mario did ; but he takes time in building up a foreboding atmosphere that really compliments the film well . the central setting , a large castle , makes the perfect place for a story like this to take place in and lamberto makes the best of it ; even if it does involve ripping off superior films at times ; such as the inferno-style pool scene . the plot itself is not quite as good as the atmosphere as several scenes are drawn out far too long and the relationship between the characters is rather strange ( particularly between the husband and wife ) . there 's not a great deal of bloodshed , but bava does get to do a little bit with the special effects . the ogre itself looks really silly and it 's a good job that we do n't get to see it very often . we do boil down to a fitting , if highly predictable , ending and overall i have to say that this film is much better than expected and comes recommended .
first i was caught totally off guard by the film 's initial lyricism and then i became totally enchanted with the unfolding story and engrossed with the brilliant directing . the characters were all fully developed , not bigger-than-life but just like the people we live among anywhere we are in the world , in sweden , in turkey or in america , all completely believable human beings with foibles and nobility . hollywood could learn so much from this beautiful film . it shows that there is no need to go into every little detail behind every action to bring out the whole theme clear and bright , and that shows the brilliance of the director ! hearfelt thanks to kay pollak and the wonderful cast for this superb treat ! !
holes is an awesome movie . i love it a lot and it 's one of my favorite films . it 's one of the few flicks produced by disney that is n't cheesy . holes is generally a very cool motion picture . i wish disney would make more pictures like it . holes is indeed a rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool . do n't get the wrong idea , i do n't mean to bad mouth disney but most of it 's stuff is aimed towards kids and that 's okay . children deserve to have their entertainment too . but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail . but not with holes . it 's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it 's corny . really , it 's the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to . holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge . i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this .
this movie ( and yes , it 's a movie - it was shot as a two-parter , but the two parts together come down to slightly more than 2 hours ) is one of the unsung masterpieces of world cinema . a very well-mannered , and yet at the same time absolutely savage denunciation of the soviet regime and the type of person who flourished under it , the film is a faithful adaptation of the long-banned eponymous book by mikhail bulgakov . the sets are flawless , and the director made the brilliant decision to film in monochrome sepia , adding a feel of authenticity where a late-80s washed-out color incarnation would have all but ruined the film . i wo n't say much about the plot , which deserves to be discovered by the viewer himself , but the performances are true oscar material ; special mentions go out to e. evstigneev , who plays the old professor with such presence , gravitas and kind wisdom that with barely a word or a gesture , he ends up stealing every scene he 's in . the second , of course , is creature/sharikov , who , played to horrifying perfection by v. tolokonnikov , is by far more frightening a character than hannibal lecter , because not only does he exist in real life - entire countries have been ran by men like him throughout history , with all that ensues . while it 's a socio political allegory , it is worth mentioning that the movie is also brimming with humor , albeit dark - there are many outright comedies which have n't made me laugh as much as this film . what 's more , when laughing at this movie , the feeling is not only one of hilarity but of understanding and agreement , which is always a plus . there is hardly a complaint i have with this movie - the only slight flaw is the tone of intellectual/bourgeois snobbery i caught at times from the `` enlightened '' characters . but that 's a minor quibble . sadly , this film appears to have been bypassed by western licensing companies . it 's a crying shame that one of the all-round best movies out there is languishing unrestored and untranslated ( which should n't be incredibly hard - though all the cultural references and the revolutionary terminology will necessarily fade in translation , the film 's main themes should be accessible to all ) . while we 're waiting with our fingers crossed for the criterion edition , i 'm considering creating english subtitles myself . will see how that works out .
i did not intend to write this review , but having read the default review that shows up on this movie 's url , i felt compelled to write a rebuttal . the movie in a word is superlative . it does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written . i think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent . in fact , i too was turned off by the excessive show of evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent . however , i must beg to differ with the reviewer in that , this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action . i think , what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers , how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic , simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another . this does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary , mostly well meaning , basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life . ultimately , it is a matter of faith . you have to take it on faith and that 's all . and if you are given to faith , then you can appreciate any show of faith . and if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome . it is thus at the same time , instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie . in any case , the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are 'secret sunshine ' in this world that awaits all wounded souls , regardless of their religious orientation . and that 's just the core message of the film ! please note the last scene of the movie , if you do n't get this ! in the end , the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you - the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself . thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally . i do agree with the reviewer in that , the evangelical stuff was a bit too much . however , given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie , i think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an evangelist  basher ! the actor kang-ho song was great as always . he 's so balanced and just perfect that he 's just amazing . he 's my favorite korean actor no doubt . i know the actress do-yeon jeon got the cannes award for best actress for this movie . however , i did not find any specialty in her acting . it seems that to get awards you just have to act really convincingly in crying and hysterical scenes and all all in all a great movie . if you do n't like it  please watch it again and see if you get it ! if it leaves you dissatisfied or uncomfortable or asking questions then think , if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place !
this film is absolutely stunning . a new blade runner - future noir at it 's most gritty . the vision of paris is superb , both recognisable and visionary , with sweeping vistas , grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual reality . the story line is quite simple , with few surprises , but that 's not what i like most about the film . it is a visual treat . done in 3d and rendered in black and white ( no greys ! ) with only one short spot of colour , it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds . there are many `` arty '' camera shots - closeups and odd viewpoints - but that just adds to the temperament of the film . overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form . i was initially under the impression that the film had been rotoscoped , such was the level of animation and high detail in the character 's facial expressions . but unlike `` a scanner darkly '' - which suffers from ( or indeed is enhanced by ) inconsistent character definition ( just watch the way some of the hair changes shape ! ) - renaissance is consistent and precise throughout . when the character is in close-up , added details and texture can bee seen , but when in mid-shot or further away details are omitted , but not to the detriment of character definition . for me , the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a one-off project . such a shame , as i would like to see more of this futuristic film-noir storyline and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style . oh , and the english dub is great too . all in all a great film and highly recommended .
dev anand ( or prashant ) and zeenat aman ( jasbir/janice ) are siblings brought up in single parent families . jasbir ( the sister ) grows up in an affluent environment but this is not enough to lead her to reject her life and ultimately join a hippie movement that eventually leads her to drugs . prashant ( the brother ) on the other hand grows up in a less affluent environment but grows up to be a matured gentleman . the story marks prashant making efforts to save his little sister ( who is perpetually in a trance ) from a hostile hippie environment . this movie stands the test of time , commenting that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up on their lives when they should instead stand up and be counted in the face of adversity . great music compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and to different people , and the director brings forth an eerie feeling to it .
what a surprising treat to come across on late television . had i only read a brief plot rundown on a television listing before seeing the movie , i would have passed . the idea of a movie about a hit-man-seeing-a shrink-wanting-to leave-the-business-and-falling-in-love .... sounds trite . but the film works . from the start of the movie , it 's clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders , before he even says a word . the look and feel of the film is perfect . dark , but not obnoxiously so . aside from the hit-man family aspect which provides a touch of surrealism , macy 's character grapples with his marriage , and his father 's control . macy shows a repressed sadness , and his bedtime talks with his young son are amazing . the young boy shows acting skills well beyond his years , and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural , personal and loving . this is one of the best movies i 've seen in a while , and i ca n't believe i came across it by accident on late night television .
. . . is just as good as the original . very nearly achieves greatness because of cundieff 's remarkable ear for music and dialogue . skewers the self-important swagger of the hip-hop poseurs . the group `` niggaz with hats '' ( nwh ) are every rap group you ever heard and utterly self-parodic . wardrobe is unbelievable . buy the oop soundtrack if you can .
a sweet-natured young mountain man with a sad past ( henry thomas ) comes upon an abandoned baby girl in the woods and instantly falls in love with her . the town elders generally support him in keeping the child , though a local temptress ( cara seymour ) thinks little of the new family . a determined little girl on a long walk and a sinister travelling salesman ( david strathairn at his creepiest ) have parallel stories which converge in a fateful way . this is a charming slice-of-life in the ozarks in the same vein as `` where the lillies bloom '' & `` the dollmaker '' . all three were shot on location in those beautiful hills and cover the lives of simple-living -- but not simple-minded -- american folk . a minimum of strong language and brief but pointed violence make this fairly-safe family viewing .
`` this man 's navy '' is , as other comments have indicated , a rare and well-filmed look at navy lighter than air ( lta ) activities . the lta crews were justly proud that the convoys they shadowed never lost a ship to submarine attack . and the filming at the various nas locations give a valuable glimpse at a type of aviation that is long gone . however , the first half of the movie is all about beery , his relationship with his service pals , and him meeting the tom drake character and his mother , and getting drake 's leg fixed . only then does the second film start . the second film is mostly ltas in action , taking on a surfaced sub , guys get killed and much damage is caused . the look is fairly gritty and realistic , i imagine . then we shift to southeast asia . did the navy have ltas there ? never mind , this part is really wild , with a blimp being used to extract some downed aircrew from the jungle . and the japs are shooting like mad . shades of vietnam , except the getaway is oh , so leisurely . this is a blimp we 're talking about . in the end , a feel-good wwii drama about a very unusual part of the war .
if you can not enjoy a chick flick , stop right now . if , however , you enjoy films that illustrate complex characters and provide extraordinary acting , read on . ann grant lord is dying . her two daughters arrive to be at her bedside . ann begins talking about people from her past of whom the daughters are unaware , and they question as to whether these lost acquaintances are real or imagined . they come to realize that these people from their mother 's past are , indeed , real . the story shifts , basically , between 1953 and circa 2000 with a few glimpses at ann 's life between those years . it was in 1953 that ann met the love of her life and experienced her life 's greatest tragedy . one of ann 's two best friends from college , lila , is being married . ann 's other best friend is lila 's brother , buddy . lila and buddy are the children of a rich newport family , whereas ann is a cabaret singer living in greenwich village who wants to be a free spirit but is still bound by many of those 1950 's conventions . soon after ann arrives to be maid of honor at lila 's wedding , she meets the person who will become the pivotal character in the lives of the three - harris . he is the adult son of a former servant of the family who grew up with lila and buddy and has gone on to become a physician in a small new england town . ann immediately becomes enamored of harris which adds a complication to the fact that lila has always been in love with harris and continues to be . buddy , also , is in love with harris , but being 1953 , he has redirected that homosexual desire for harris to his good friend , ann for he can not admit to himself that he has a sexual craving for another man . buddy exhibits his inner frustration outwardly by being the alcoholic , wise-cracking bad boy of the family - much to the chagrin of his very proper and uptight parents . needless to say , all of these expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy - after all this is a chick flick . in the present time , ann 's daughters have become distant from their mother and are suffering their own life realizations and doubts . constance is working to emotional exhaustion trying to keep up her roll as perfect mother and wife . nina , having always felt inferior , can not maintain a relationship . stir all of these relationships into a span of fifty years , and you get an intriguing look at society , its values , and its effects upon the personalities and actions of the complex people involved . all of the acting in evening is excellent , but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - that make this film so very , very special . claire danes plays the 1950 's ann , and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is conflicted by what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants to do . her performance is not easily forgettable . vanessa redgrave plays the dying ann whose mind shifts from the present , to the past , to flights of fantasy , and of course , redgrave pulls it all off with sterling style . natasha richardson - redgrave 's real daughter - plays ann 's daughter , constance , in the film . the scenes between this real life mother and daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watch . toni collette plays ann 's other daughter , nina . nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister . collette is perfect for a part such as this , but i have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays . mamie gummer plays 1950 's lila and shows us a woman even more conflicted of her expected role in life than her good friend , ann . she is very good . meryl streep - gummer 's mother - plays present day lila . what is there to say about meryl streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance . director lajos koltai states in the dvd extras that he sought out glenn close to play the relatively small part of lila 's mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film . he certainly was right , and close 's performance in that one scene etches it in your mind . all the other scenes in which close is lila 's very proper mother , and you get another performance to treasure . there are three other scenes in the film , combined with the one featuring close described above , that make the whole movie worth watching . on lila 's wedding day , ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss lila 's misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love . this scene is repeated fifty years later when lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend ann to talk about the lives they have lived . in this latter scene , streep and redgrave are enthralling . the other memorable scene - at least to me - is when buddy declares his love for ann . hugh dancy as buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings . his performance is superior . chick flick ? yes . a very special film with unbelievable acting , directing , and scenery ? definitely . i can not recommend evening too much .
most people , especially young people , may not understand this film . it looks like a story of loss , when it is actually a story about being alone . some people may never feel loneliness at this level . cheadles character johnson reflected the total opposite of sandlers character fineman . where johnson felt trapped by his blessings , fineman was trying to forget his life in the same perspective . jada is a wonderful additive to the cast and sandler pulls tears . cheadle had the comic role and was a great supporter for sandler . i see oscars somewhere here . a very fine film . if you have ever lost and felt alone , this film will assure you that you 're not alone . jerry
for people interested in business and the corporate world , this show is simply the best of the best . as one of the former contestants of the show wrote in his blog about this innovative show : people in business finally had an audience . the whole idea is perfect ; having a group of businesspeople competing against each other in business-related tasks , set in the best place in the world , new york city . donald trump is perfect as the boss , even though his ego is bigger than the whole universe times infinity . he also makes a lot of questionable decisions about whom to fire , which is one of the negatives about the show . season 1 : great season overall , the best season of the `` normal '' ones . this season was the one that was most about actual business skills . later on the series almost drowned in marketing related tasks with way too many product placements . great and interesting contestants overall , with the most likable character ever in this series : troy . i know i 'm not the only person who suspect that the trump world tower-episode where he got fired was rigged to have amy and nick win this particular task . season 2 : also a great season . the tasks were still pretty much ok , and it had many interesting contestants . jen m was terrible and should never had made it to the final , imo . also , this season had the worst firing ever ( pamela ) . season 3 : terrible . actually , i liked the concept of book smarts vs. street smarts , but the cast was so utterly terrible ( it turned out that trump hated the cast as well ) that the whole season was a total disaster . best moments was the second episode ( motel renovation ) , with pm brian fired , a guy who added nothing but huge amounts of comedy value . season 4 : an excellent season , much because of the interesting and entertaining contestants this season ( especially randall , alla , marcus and the total disaster whose name was toral ) . the `` take me out to the boardroom '' episode is one of the absolute classics of this show , ending with the well-remembered quadruple firing . sadly , i think we got robbed for the randall vs. alla final . i think trump was afraid that she could have won , and prevented that from happening . season 5 : a boring season with really no special things to it . brent was just an embarrassment and obviously only there to create drama . the tasks were terrible overall ( how has creating a jingle anything to do with business at all ? ) . i guess the best man won , but personally i could n't care less . season 6 : i can see why they wanted to try out l.a. as a new location for the show , but looking back it was a mistake . new york will always be the place for this . this season added so many new things , most of them terrible ( like losing team having to sleep outside in tents , winning pm continues to be pm , for example ) . the tasks were terrible and trump also chose the wrong winner . james deserved it , no doubt . season 7 : celebrity edition . best season ever . totally different rules ( like the use of rolodexes ) , but all fun and entertainment . the biggest problem was that many of the contestants were not real celebrities at all , especially the women where everyone were unknown to me except for omarosa , who is a total disgrace to everything she takes part in . this looked to be gene simmon 's season , but after he made a complete fool of himself during the kodak task , another man emerged from the shadows : piers morgan . never has anyone dominated a season like he did . he crushed his opponents and also came across as a guy with a great sense of humor ( although some uptight americans ( not all americans , of course , do n't take me wrong ) sadly did n't have the social skills to understand it ) . way to go piers ! ! for fans of this i highly recommend the uk version starring sir alan sugar as the boss . in fact , the british version is way better , and that says something since the american ( and original ) truly is a great show . one thing about the uk version is that the contestants normally tend to behave like decent human beings in the boardroom , unlike the constant yelling and rude behavior that takes place in the us version .
if you only read a synopsis of the plot , this movie would sound like quite a typical one of the 1930 's . the story would seem quite contrived , the subject matter maudlin . the strength and beauty of this film is in the direct , earthy performances of the cast.i have seldom seen jean harlow display such a range of feeling , rich and subtle nuances float over her face . if you watch their faces during the wedding ceremony in the chapel , there is such an obvious depth of feeling between the principal characters . the raw emotions are so sincerely portrayed , so true . the final sequence is almost unbearably poignant : when clark gable looks down with such joy and surprise at his son , lifts him up and proudly says , `` my kid ! `` , i could n't help remember that mr. gable 's own son was born to him posthumously . this is one of the finest examples of depression era cinema .
astronaut steve west ( alex rebar ) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of saturn . his comrades are killed instantly , but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones . steve returns to earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp ; as he turns into a savage killer , melting every step of the way , he is tracked by his friend , dr. ted nelson ( burr debenning ) . this is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it 's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional . it seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the '50 's and 60 's , and as such , it 's a marvelously entertaining movie . that sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious . we 're even treated to a split screen sequence that does n't really add anything , but is still a gas to watch . writer / director william sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea ; his ultra-slimy character is a memorable one indeed . i think his pacing is a little off ; some scenes ( like the one with the elderly couple ) go on a little long , but ultimately he delivers solid , schlocky , b-movie goods with a degree of panache . the climax is especially fun . arlon obers ' music is enjoyably shuddery ( yet also amusingly silly during some moments ) , and willy curtis 's cinematography creates some really great shots at times . that brings me to rick bakers ' fantastic and convincing makeup effects , which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie , right down to the ultimate final melt . rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie ( sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running ) and does what he has to do well enough . debenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero , and ann sweeney is n't so hot either as his wife , but myron healey , michael alldredge , and lisle wilson are fine in support . it 's also worth it to see folk like cheryl `` rainbeaux '' smith ( doing an appreciable topless shot ) , janus blythe ( of tobe hoopers ' `` eaten alive '' and wes cravens ' `` the hills have eyes '' ) , and even director jonathan demme in a bit part . this is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore , chills , and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere . 8/10
weak start , solid middle , fantastic finish . that 's my impression of this film , anyway . i liked simon pegg in the two films i 've seen him in -- - hot fuzz , and shaun of the dead . his role here , though , took a completely different turn . shows his range as an actor , but nonetheless i really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginning . there 's a kind of humour i call `` frustration comedy . '' its supposed `` jokes '' and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments . much like the bean character rowan atkinmson plays . there are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too . i do n't mean to bash them here , so will not . but do be warned that if you are like me , and you dislike smarmy and maddeningly bungling idiots , pegg shows just such characteristics for the first third of this film . it does get better , however . i read somewhere that this is based on a true story . hmmm . maybe . the film 's story stopped being annoying , and became kind of a triumph of the `` little guy '' in the final third . i do n't need all films to be sugar and light -- - but coincidentally , as this film got better , it also started to be more and more of a happy ending . it was also a pleasure to see an old favourite , jeff bridges , play a role so masterfully . i liked `` iron man , '' but was saddened by the fact that bridges ' character was a villain . purely personal taste , of course , as his acting in that was superb . nonetheless , he was a marvel here as the bigger than life man of vision , the publisher of sharps . it was nice to see him in a role that i could actually enjoy . overall then , i liked it ! i just wish i had come in 40 minutes late , and missed the beginning .
this is a really old fashion charming movie . the locations are great and the situation is one of those old time preston sturgess movies . fi you want to watch a movie that does n't demand much other then to sit back and relax then this is it . the acting is good , and i really liked michael rispoli . he was in rounders , too . and while you were sleeping . the rest of the cast is fun . it 's just what happens when two people about to get married meet the one that they really love on the weekend that they are planning their own weddings . i know ... sounds kooky ... but it is . and that 's what makes it fun to watch . it will make your girl friend either hug you or leave you , but at least you 'll know .
this is the touching story of two families in israel and the relationships within each family . each family has a gay son . the stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members , not just the two sons . the portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak .
marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of world war 11 england . what makes this film so good is the touching of the human element.this film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classics such as `` mrs. miniver '' and `` hope and glory . '' as is the case with this film , we see the desperation of people in the time of war . the performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered john thaw , who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the london bombing . we soon see why this child wets his bed . he comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly . the old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life . when the child is returned to his mother , the old man goes to london and seeks him out only to find tragedy . he literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy 's home . the picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships .
guys , you got to watch this awesome movie . at the end of this movie you will have a strong passion and profundity imbued into yourselves . the acting of the two characters , billy sunday and carl brashear deeply touches the heart from inside . this movie is about principles , dignity , patriotism and honor . you will hear chief carl brashear say , the navy has greatest tradition of all - honor - practiced thoroughly by these two characters . mere glances of these characters during the movie fills you with enthusiasm . dialogue delivery of this movie is perfect . you ca n't find any flaws in the dialogues . what the master chief billy says roams in and out of your mind for a long time after watching the movie . please watch this movie .
passport to pimlico is a real treat for all fans of british cinema . not only is it an enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining comedy , but it is a cinematic flashback to a bygone age , with attitudes and scenarios sadly now only a memory in british life . stanley holloway plays pimlico resident arthur pemberton , who after the accidental detonation of an unexploded bomb , discovers a wealth of medieval treasure belonging to the 14th century duke of burgundy that has been buried deep underneath their little suburban street these last 600 years . accompanying the treasure is an ancient legal decree signed by king edward iv of england ( which has never been officially rescinded ) to state that that particular london street had been declared burgandian soil , which means that in the eyes of international law , pemberton and the other local residents are no longer british subjects but natives of burgundy and their tiny street an independent country in it 's own right and a law unto itself . this sets the war-battered and impoverished residents up in good stead as they believe themselves to be outside of english law and jurisdiction , so in an act of drunken defiance they burn their ration books , destroy and ignore their clothing coupons , flagrantly disregard british licencing laws etc , declaring themselves fully independent from britain . however , what then happens is ever spiv , black marketeer and dishonest crook follows suit and crosses the 'border ' into burgundy as a refuge from the law and post-war restrictions to sell their dodgy goods , and half of london 's consumers follow them in order to dodge the ration , making their quiet happy little haven , a den of thieves and a rather crowded one at that . appealing to whitehall for assistance , they are told that due to developments this is `` now a matter of foreign policy , which his majesty 's government is reluctant to become involved '' which leaves the residents high and dry . they do however declare the area a legal frontier and as such set up a fully equipped customs office at the end of the road , mainly to monitor smuggling than to ensure any safety for the residents of pimlico . eventually the border is closed altogether starting a major siege , with the bugundian residents slowly running out of water and food , but never the less fighting on in true british style . as one bugundian resident quotes , `` we 're english and we always were english , and it 's just because we are english , we are fighting so hard to be bugundians '' a sentiment that is soon echoed throughout the capital as when the rest of london learn of the poor bugundians plight they all feel compelled to chip in and help them , by throwing food and supplies over the barbed wire blockades . will whitehall , who has fought off so may invaders throughout the centuries finally be brought to it 's knees by this new batch of foreigners , especially as these ones are english ! ! ! ! great tale , and great fun throughout . not to be missed .
great acting , great movie . if you are thinking of building see this movie first . the dollar amounts may have changed but everything else is the same . the humor is true to life and emotions are those that anyone who has built has felt .
i would say for it 's time , this movie was awesome ... and yes if you have no desire to become a christian , then why bother watching it . i saw this movie after i had already been saved and found it to be very moving . i see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the left behind series ... they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people . i think in order to actually judge this movie , you should see it , , , there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if i am not mistaken ... do n't use our comments to judge , see the movie for yourself ! ! god will bless you if that is why you are watching them .
for me this movie was powerful . i do n't want to be a spoiler , but i had a friend years ago ; we were like brothers . this movie brought back some vivid memories . for some reason , i could n't place my vote for this movie which would have been a 10 . i kept getting a message like `` no votes have been placed .... '' and yet i saw in the stats that there were . will try again tomorrow ( monday ) . minor flaws i overlooked . it was the relationships between the characters that got me . beautifully acted and real situations . i 've been in a couple of them . a small gem of a movie . just like `` spring forward '' is another overlooked gem . i 'm very glad movies like these are still being made ; about relationships between people , well written , sensitively unfolded with first-class acting and direction . after all , is n't that what it 's all about ?
i first saw this movie about 4 years ago and i was expecting something funny , similar to cb4 . i was blown away . i was on the floor laughing my butt off this movie is so great . way better than cb4 , the characters , the songs , the plot , everything . top notch independent film that was given `` two thumbs up '' by siskel and egbert ( and if two old white guys can understand the humour in this flick , you know it 's good ) .
when i was 17 my high school staged bye bye birdie - which is no great surprise , since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the most-staged musical in the world . i was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs , as well as a lingering disregard for the dick van dyke movie version which had ( deliberately ) obscured the elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audience . so , when the 1995 version starring jason alexander hit my cable tv screen , i was delighted with what i saw . alexander turns in an exceptional performance as albert , a performance in strong contrast to his better-known persona from a certain tv series . the remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles ( chynna phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part , supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl ) . but best of all , the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be ( allowing for the absence of a stage ) . so , if you know the musical ( and few do not ) , then check out this telemovie . it does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered , which is good enough for me . what is better than rendering a writer 's work faithfully and with colour and style ?
my favorite part of this film was the old man 's attempt to cure his neighbor 's ills by putting the strong medicine in his bath . there is more than a sense of family , there is a sense of community .
lock up your daughters is one of the best high-spirited comedies i have ever seen . it is misunderstood since it lacks the `` social commentary '' values that many films of the day ( 1969 ) required to be successful . the characters are over-the-top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors . christopher plummer shines especially bright as lord foppington , a noble with hair too big to fit in the door . the plot involves the usual 18th century stuff ; mistaken identities , thwarted romances , corrupt government officials , and jokes at every turn . it answers the questions : what happens when 4 rambunctious , eager to party sailors are on leave in a small british coastal town ? and , who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out ? despite doing poorly at the box office , it has great costumes , excellent music ( based on the mermaid theatre musical of the same name ) , great , lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic . that it has never been released on either vhs or dvd is truly a shame , since so many bad movies are released every day .
probably the two main significances of `` elmer 's pet rabbit '' are that the wacky leporid featured in `` a wild hare '' now has a name , and that he utters his famous `` of course you realize this means war ! '' for the first time . mostly , the termite terrace crowd was still trying to figure out what exactly to do with this long-eared rascal . it 's certainly a must-see for hard-core fans of this genre , but others will probably have little reason to take interest . but make no mistake , it 's quite hilarious what bugs bunny does to the eternally gullible elmer fudd . clear shades of things to come abound throughout the cartoon . i recommend it .
