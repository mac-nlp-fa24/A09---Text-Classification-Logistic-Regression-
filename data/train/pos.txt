for a movie that gets no respect there sure are a lot of memorable quotes listed for this gem . imagine a movie where joe piscopo is actually funny ! maureen stapleton is a scene stealer . the moroni character is an absolute scream . watch for alan `` the skipper '' hale jr. as a police sgt .
bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by cristina raines ( later of tv 's `` flamingo road '' ) as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is slated to pay for her attempted suicides by guarding the gateway to hell ! the scenes with raines modeling are very well captured , the mood music is perfect , deborah raffin is charming as cristina 's pal , but when raines moves into a creepy brooklyn heights brownstone ( inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor ) , things really start cooking . the neighbors , including a fantastically wicked burgess meredith and kinky couple sylvia miles & beverly d'angelo , are a diabolical lot , and eli wallach is great fun as a wily police detective . the movie is nearly a cross-pollination of `` rosemary 's baby '' and `` the exorcist '' -- but what a combination ! based on the best-seller by jeffrey konvitz , `` the sentinel '' is entertainingly spooky , full of shocks brought off well by director michael winner , who mounts a thoughtfully downbeat ending with skill . * * * 1/2 from * * * *
a solid , if unremarkable film . matthau , as einstein , was wonderful . my favorite part , and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again , was the wonderful scene with the physicists playing badmitton , i loved the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for robbins to retrieve the birdie .
it 's a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their rollicking kids . i felt like instead of a movie ticket , i should have been given a nambla membership . based upon thomas rockwell 's respected book , how to eat fried worms starts like any children 's story : moving to a new town . the new kid , fifth grader billy forrester was once popular , but has to start anew . making friends is never easy , especially when the only prospect is poindexter adam . or erica , who at 4 1/2 feet , is a giant . further complicating things is joe the bully . his freckled face and sleeveless shirts are daunting . he antagonizes kids with the death ring : a crackerjack ring that is rumored to kill you if you 're punched with it . but not immediately . no , the death ring unleashes a poison that kills you in the eight grade . joe and his axis of evil welcome billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos . once discovered , billy plays it cool , swearing that he eats worms all the time . then he throws them at joe 's face . ewww ! to win them over , billy reluctantly bets that he can eat 10 worms . fried , boiled , marinated in hot sauce , squashed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich . each meal is dubbed an exotic name like the `` radioactive slime delight , '' in which the kids finally live out their dream of microwaving a living organism . if you 've ever met me , you 'll know that i have an uncontrollably hearty laugh . i felt like a creep erupting at a toddler whining that his `` dilly dick '' hurts . but fried worms is wonderfully disgusting . like a g-rated farrelly brothers film , it is both vomitous and delightful . writer/director bob dolman is also a savvy storyteller . to raise the stakes the worms must be consumed by 7 pm . in addition billy holds a dark secret : he has an ultra-sensitive stomach . dolman also has a keen sense of perspective . with such accuracy , he draws on children 's insecurities and tendency to exaggerate mundane dilemmas . if you were to hyperbolize this movie the way kids do their quandaries , you will see that it is essentially about war . freedom-fighter and freedom-hater use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars , only to learn a valuable lesson in unity . international leaders can learn a thing or two about global peacekeeping from fried worms . at the end of the film , i was comforted when two chaperoning mothers behind me , looked at each other with befuddlement and agreed , `` that was a great movie . '' great , now i wo n't have to register myself in any lawful databases .
you probably all already know this by now , but 5 additional episodes never aired can be viewed on abc.com i 've watched a lot of television over the years and this is possibly my favorite show , ever . it 's a crime that this beautifully written and acted show was canceled . the actors that played laura , whit , carlos , mae , damian , anya and omg , steven caseman - are all incredible and so natural in those roles . even the kids are great . wonderful show . so sad that it 's gone . of course i wonder about the reasons it was canceled . there is no way i 'll let myself believe that ms. moynahan 's pregnancy had anything to do with it . it was in the perfect time slot in this market . i 've watched all the episodes again on abc.com - i hope they all come out on dvd some day . thanks for reading .
i saw the movie with two grown children . although it was not as clever as shrek , i thought it was rather good . in a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break , there was not a sound so i know the children all liked it . there parents also seemed engaged . the death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments . hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids . as such , it was successful although i liked it too . personally i liked the scrat ! !
you 're using the imdb . you 've given some hefty votes to some of your favourite films . it 's something you enjoy doing . and it 's all because of this . fifty seconds . one world ends , another begins . how can it not be given a ten ? i wonder at those who give this a seven or an eight ... exactly how could the first film ever made be better ? for the record , the long , still opening shot is great showmanship , a superb innovation , perfectly suited to the situation . and the dog on the bike is a lovely touch . all this within fifty seconds . the word genius is often overused . this is genius .
this was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption . i loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family . well-acted and well-directed . if there were any flaws , i 'd have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again . what about all people of all cultural backgrounds ? i would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown - like in real life . nevertheless , the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker . loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes
made after quartet was , trio continued the quality of the earlier film versions of the short stories by maugham . here the three stories are the verger , mr. know-it-all , and sanitorium . the first two are comic ( the verger is like a prolonged joke , but one with a good pay-off ) , and the last more serious ( as health issues are involved ) . again the author introduces the film and the stories . james hayter , soon to have his signature role as samuel pickwick , is the hero in the verger . he holds this small custodial-type job in a church , but the new vicar ( michael hordern ) is an intellectual snob . when he hears hayter has no schooling he fires him . hayter has saved some money , so he tells his wife ( kathleen harrison ) he fancies buying a small news and tobacco shop . he has a good eye , and his store thrives . soon he has a whole chain of stores . when his grandchild is christened by hordern , the latter is amazed to see how prosperous his ex-verger . the payoff is when bank manager felix aylmer meets with hayter about diversifying his investments . i 'll leave it to you to hear the unintentional but ironic coda of the meeting . according to maugham he met a man like max kelada ( nigel patrick ) on a cruise . in mr. know-it-all kelada is a splashy , friendly , and slightly overbearing type from the middle east who is on a business trip ( regarding jewelry ) by steamship . his state-room mate is mr. grey ( the ever quiet and proper wilfred hyde-white ) who is somewhat , silently disapproving of max . max likes to enliven things , and soon is heavily involved in the ship 's entertainment . at this point the story actually resembles part of the plot of the non-maugham story and film china seas ( 1935 ) , as max makes a bet that he can tell a real piece of jewelry from a fake ( after insisting that a piece of jewelry he spotted is real ) . i wo n't describe the way max rises to the occasion . sanitorium is the longest segment . roland culver plays `` ashenden '' ( the fictional alter-ego of maugham - a writer and one time spy as in hitchcock 's the secret agent ) . here he has to use a sanitorium for a couple of months for his health . he finds a remarkable crew of people , including jean simmons as a frail but beautiful young woman , finlay currie as an irascible scotsman , john laurie as a second irascible scotsman who is `` at war '' with currie , raymond huntley as a quiet patient who only shows his internal anger at his situation when his wife shows up , and michael rennie as a young man who has a serious life threatening illness . culver watches as three stories among these characters play out to their conclusions . the last , dealing with simmons and rennie , is ironic but deeply moving . it was a dandy follow-up to the earlier quartet , and well worth watching .
for a mature man , to admit that he shed a tear over this film is a mature response , to a mature film . if one need admit more then perhaps one could say that , `` life '' can never be the same , after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level .
aileen gonsalves , my girlfriend , is in this film playing a secretary at the main character 's bank . she has a lovely scene with roshan seth in a restaurant . there 's more information on her website at > having stated my personal interest in the film , i have to say that i think it is a beautiful movie - moving , funny and beautifully filmed .
jonathan demme 's directorial debut for roger corman 's legendary exploitation outfit new world pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicks-in-chains 70 's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid . beauteous russ meyer starlet eric ( `` vixen , '' `` beyond the valley of the dolls '' ) gavin gives a robust , winning performance as a brassy , resilient new fish who does her best to persevere in a grimy , hellish penitentiary . the always fabulous barbara steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean , crippled , sexually frustrated warden ( her erotic dream about doing a slow , steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly ) . longtime favorite 70 's b-movie actress roberta ( `` the arousers , '' `` unholy rollers '' ) collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward , foul-mouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gut-busting dirty joke about pinnochio . lynda gold ( a.k.a . crystin sinclaire of tobe hooper 's `` eaten alive '' and curtis harrington 's `` ruby '' ) makes her lively film debut as uninhibited wildcat crazy alice . and the ever-cuddly cheryl `` rainbeaux '' smith does a lovely , touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from `` lemora : a child 's tale of the supernatural . '' although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language , nudity , rape and violence , it 's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth ; the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the pro-feminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force . demme 's zesty , confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments of engagingly quirky human behavior . furthermore , both tak fujimoto 's vibrant cinematography and john cale 's marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100 % on the money excellent . patrick wright ( sheriff mack in the uproariously awful cheap-rubber-monster-suit creature feature howler `` track of the moonbeast '' ) has a sidesplitting bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom . lively , rousing and immensely enjoyable , `` caged heat '' qualifies as absolutely essential viewing for 70 's drive-in movie fans .
when i rented this movie to watch it , i knew that it was not going to be a mindbender movie . instead i thought of it as a disbelief of reality where someone is going to get a serious beating . and you know what it worked . kurt russel did what i though was a remarkable role in showing the emotionless soldier that he was . i recommend this movie if your out with the boys and want to watch a good action film .
it 's hard to say sometimes why exactly a film is so effective . from the moment i first came across `` the stone boy '' , something told me it would be a great film . in spite of that , it seemed very unlikely that i 'd ever have the opportunity to actually see it for myself . then , one day , while looking through the online catalogue of my local library , i saw that they had recently purchased the dvd release of this film . which i 'm extremely glad for , because the cinematography is of a stunning depth and quality that an old vhs copy could never replicate . and speaking of the cinematography , i must single it out as far and above the most stunning aspect of this film . as a photographer who pursues very nearly the exact visual style portrayed in `` the stone boy '' , i 'm a firm believer in the fact that a great cinematographer can almost single-handedly carry a film . here , he has a lot of help from an extremely talented cast , and a director who understands perfectly what the story needs . but to have juan ruiz anchía behind the camera makes virtually every scene something of beauty . and you can almost never say that . most films would never even expect such a thing of you . scene after scene captures some detail , some little bit of visual magic that takes your breath away . the director , christopher cain , has had a long and interesting career . as far as i can gather , this film is not very representative of it . but , sometimes , to catch a director near the beginnings of his career , before all the big budgets and loss of focus , there 's a real subtle magic to be found . cain steps back in this film , lets things happen with a life of their own , and then ever further . much like early john sayles films , characters are given space to breathe , time to talk . side stories happen because they do , and that 's how life is . cain displays a remarkable , raw , even outright painful understanding of human nature in this film . the acting ties much of this story together . when people talk , when they exist in this film , they do so as actual people , not held back by the fact that they are playing characters . gina berriault 's script allows immensely talented and respected actors like wilford brimley , robert duvall , glenn close , and frederic forrest to spend time simply existing . whether the things they have to say are minor or of deep significance , it all comes down with the weight of pure reality . when you look at the actors involved , or the great soundtrack by james horner , it seems strange that such a film be very nearly forgotten . maybe much of what makes `` the stone boy '' what it is was the time period it was made in . there 's this 1970s hangover feeling to this picture that reminds me deeply of my own childhood . people talk of the 80s in terms of modern styles and music , but that 's not the 80s i lived in or remember . the look of the images , the understated and dark knowing quality of the acting , and the overall result should get under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in north america . i see myself in this . i see how i saw the world . and a film like `` the stone boy '' sees the world for how it truly is . for more of this feeling , please see : the black stallion ( 1979 ) , never cry wolf ( 1983 ) , tender mercies ( 1983 ) , testament ( 1983 ) , places in the heart ( 1984 ) , matewan ( 1987 ) , high tide ( 1987 ) , driving miss daisy ( 1989 ) , the secret garden ( 1993 ) , the secret of roan inish ( 1994 ) , wendy and lucy ( 2008 )
yes , this gets the full ten stars . it 's plain as day that this fill is genius . the universe sent trent harris a young , wonderfully strange man one day and harris caught him on tape , in all that true misfit glory that you just ca n't fake . too bad it ended in tragedy for the young man , if only an alternate ending could be written for that fellow 's story . the other two steps in the trilogy do retell the story , with sean penn and crispin glover in the roles of the young men , respectively . the world is expanded upon and the strangeness is contextualized by the retelling , giving us a broader glimpse into growing up weird in vanilla america . recommended for anyone and everyone !
hello . this movie is ....... well ....... okay . just kidding ! its awesome ! it 's not a block buster smash hit . it 's not meant to be . but its a big hit in my world . and my sisters . we are rockin ' rollers . go ramones ! ! ! ! this is a great movie .............. for me !
this is a film that was very well done . i had heard mixed reviews while it was in production and have been waiting for its release ! cheers to the director and all the actors . the supporting cast gave eva mendez what she needed to take this to the top . as everyone else here states , the latter portion of the film is riveting . katie cassidy did an amazing job with her character , being she had not done a lot of work when this film was made . she has quite the career ahead of her . i was amazed at her performance . i completely enjoyed the film , questioned my values in life and priorities , and am a better person for it ! a great message lies within the film . release it so all can enjoy !
a typical romp through cheech and chong 's reality which includes drugs , singing , more drugs , cars and driving , even more drugs , pee wee , aliens , gasoline , laundry , stand up comedy , surprisingly more drugs and space coke ! ! . it is not as coherent or plausible as up in smoke but it still is incredibly funny , without becoming as strange as nice dreams . there are some classic scenes , which include the opening scene where they get some gas for their car and the drive to work . also funny is cheech 's song ( mexican-americans ) and chong 's follow up song . another notable scene is the welfare office scene with jones ( human noise machine ) , from the police academy series , and the old laughing man . all in all , this is a great follow up to up in smoke and is quite watchable when sober or not . -celluloid rehab
ok heres what i say : the movie was excellent . i am a huge nancy fan and i have read all 1-56 original books and i went on to read more . i am now on 96 . beware of villains giving this movie a lower grade than it should have . all clues point to a wonderful movie ! i loved the whole thing . so what nancy is in current time . she is still old fashioned like she is in the books ! people who have n't read more than 5 books are complaining about the view of nancy . i have read all of them and i think emma is perfect and that nancy was perfect . i found parts of the movie spooky . i loved the exciting car chases and get aways . i loved the clues . i solved the mystery myself ! it was really wonderful . i suggest you go see it since people who have been complaining know nothing of a what a good movie is and b about nancy drew . go see it . it may not be oscar worthy but its really a good movie .
this is one of the first films i can remember , or maybe the first one . exactly the beautiful kind of film than introduce a kid , sweetly , into the world of violence and addictions were we live . a little bit of babe , casino and constantine , all this well mixed into a carton , and we get this . i do n't know if its truly rated for kids , but i think it was very cool , very funny and interesting . i hate when a film ( spescially a carton ) can have a good end and its ruining because every character must have a happy end , even if it sounds weird ( im not a bitter person ) .but this was ok , he simply goes heaven and they let it in that way . all this is just a critic , its a good movie an something new . very touching and i got ta go
this film is worth seeing alone for jared harris ' outstanding portrayal of john lennon . it does n't matter that harris does n't exactly resemble lennon ; his mannerisms , expressions , posture , accent and attitude are pure lennon . best scene : lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether paul mccartney & wings ' `` silly love songs '' is worthy of # 1 status in america .
i was 10 years old when this show was on tv . by far it was my favorite . the actors were very credible . alexandra bastedo was just gorgeous .... i just order the dvd ( 15 episodes ) . they did n't have super-powers . they just had superior human skills ( strength , hearing , sight ) . the 3 actors were very good in their rolls , very believable . there was a good story in each episode . at the time , there were no special effects or explosions everywhere , so the script was suppose to be good , and the characters performs were great . there was no fancy stuff , like in other shows . they did n't try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show . i highly recommend this tv show to anybody that like good stuff .
here 's another movie that should be loaded into a satellite , fired into space and pointed in the direction of the galaxy andromeda to show distant possible civilizations the best of humanity . this movie is so endearingly stupid and revealingly honest in being little more than a rip-off of the already bad movie classic king kong from 1976 that it not only manages to upstage that film in terms of sheer belly laugh idiotic goofiness , but successfully predicted much of peter jackson 's miserable 2005 computer cartoon bearing the same name , as far as a `` romance '' between the giant ( here a yeti ) and a gorgeous human female ( antonellina interlenghi of umberto lenzi 's city of the living dead , who is very easy on the eyes ) . the film was made for kids so aside from some innuendo over fish bones and a bizarre nipple tweak to say goodbye you can forget about sex -- the yeti even has a sort of giant jock strap to cover up his monstrous package , the result being even more amusing than anatomical correctness . but as a trade-off you do get a wacky old scientist , two inquisitive kids , tony kendall in a rare turn as a duplicitous bastard of a villain , a helpful intelligent collie dog who gets to have her own adventure ( dog adventure movies were big in europe for a while ) and of course emerges as the hero at the end for saving the yeti , who turns out to be the good guy , glorious stuff like front end loaders decorated to look like giant ape hands , a monster who 's size literally changes scale from shot to shot , some inappropriately horrible deaths that will make the carnage in godzilla vs the smog monster look tame by comparison , crowd reaction shots a-plenty made up of either spanish , italian or canadian extras depending upon scene ( you can sort of tell where they were shooting from how the extras are dressed ) , and some of the most enthusiastically staged but inept special effects work ever in a giant monkey movie . it 's here that the film won me over : it 's enthusiasm just for being made . frank kramer is actually the same gianfranco parolini who brought the world sartana in 1968 and god 's gun the year before this & was a very important director in the spaghetti western and action/adventure genre film scene from the 1960's/1970 's and by the time of yeti he was probably delighted to get the work . i would say that this is his most adventuresome movie ever , or rather the one he took the most chances with , and may have felt more comfortable taking those chances with the film aimed at kids & families . the movie has a kind of reckless abandon to the way it was made that renders the technical errors or inconsistencies totally meaningless . or rather they are part of the fun , and if the movie had been played seriously it would n't have worked -- which is exactly why peter jackson 's movie sucked . he forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the outcome using his army of stupid power macintosh pod people animators , and with all it 's faults + clunkiness , kramer 's yeti is actually closer to the spirit of why we watch movies like this , which is partly to see actors in ape suits tearing apart miniature sets on sound stages , not seamlessly animated vapid hours of nothing other than hard drive space . i 'd rank this up there with king kong versus godzilla and it ! curse of the great golem as one of the most enjoyably improbable giant rampaging monster movies ever . because the movie looks so `` fake '' you can get over the story and just have fun watching stuff get wrecked , trampled , tossed about and smashed . knowing that and armed with a fertile , energetic enthusiasm for having the chance to make the movie , parolini pulled out all the stops and delivers a full bodied adventure that might get a bit rough for some of the small tykes but is the first movie i will ever share with the grandkids someday when their stupid parents leave them with me for a weekend . this is stuff for the ages and one of the most telling expressions of humanity to ever be committed to celluloid . 10/10 , it 's about ten minutes too long but who cares , you only come around once and i 'd rather go out with a smile on my face .
to all the reviewers on this page , i would have to say this movie is worth seeing . so it was made in 1972 , so what . the fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time . people who did n't study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball . compared to the modern series , ` left behind , ' ( which is made for our time right now ) it does look cheezy . however , the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion , which again was over 30 years in the past . but . the message that is sent in this film is very powerful , and carefully preserved . there is just so much to say , but i refuse to say it . ( for fear of spoiling it ) so go out and see this film ! if you do n't like the message that it sends , then you have issues , that need some attention !
a favourite of mine , this movie tells of two feuding new york `` characters '' , steve brodie ( raft ) and `` chuck '' connors ( beery ) , who both strive to be the `` main guy '' in the bowery in the late nineteenth century . brodie ( 1863-1901 ) and connors ( 1852-1913 ) , were real people , though this is a heavily fictionalized account of their antics ( based on a play ) .brodie 's legendary ( did he do it ? - it 's still a cause of argument ! ) , jump from the brooklyn bridge ( 1886 ) , for which he became famous , is shown here as happening around the same time as the spanish-american war ( 1898 ) .director walsh clearly had a great affection for the period , so beautifully recreated here , and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer trixie odbray ( a young pert kelton ) .raft is at his slickest as brodie , and beery shows again what a clever actor he was , as tough , big hearted , and at times quite touching connors.pretty fay wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing . full of life and energy , '' the bowery '' moves at a fast pace ( unlike many early `` talkies '' ) .it is not an easy movie to find , but is well worth looking out for .
as most off you might off seen star wars : return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m|might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one ( live tv ) when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi-wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader ( real name : anakin skywalker ) when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground
i thought this movie was lol funny . it 's a fun , not to be taken seriously , movie about one man 's twisted views on life , love , and ... well , ladies `` from the lowly bus station skank , to the high-class débutante ... bus station skank . '' tim meadows plays a guy ( leon phelps ) who was raised by in a playboy-style mansion by a hugh hefner-esquire father figure , surrounded constantly by beautiful porn models and actresses . when his `` father '' kicks him out on the street he must learn to fend for himself with nothing but the chauvinistic outlook on life that his youth has taught him ... that and an unfathomable , nearly mystical level of charm and dumb luck . and so the hijinx begin ! if you have n't seen this movie and you enjoy a light-hearted , semi-mindless , comedy/love story , then i highly recommend renting `` the ladies ' man '' .
hood of the living dead had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began . first , any play on `` ... of the living dead '' invokes his holiness mr. romero and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies can not afford to aspire . and second , my movie-watching companion professed doubt that any urban horror film would surpass the seminal leprechaun in the hood . skeptical , we settled in to watch . we were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good-hearted zombie film . oh , certainly the budget is low , and of course the directors ' amateurs friends populate the cast , but hood of the living dead loves zombie cinema . cheap ? yeah . but when it 's this cheap , you can clearly see where love holds it together . ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night . he dreams of moving out of oakland . before this planned escape , however , his brother is shot to death in a drive-by . ricky 's keen scientific mind presents an option superior to cpr or 911 : injections of his lab 's experimental regenerative formula . sadly , little bro wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty oakland zombie ! chaos and mayhem ! i think it 's more economical to eat your enemies than take vengeance in a drive-by , but then again , i 'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life . ( how poor a judge ? in response to a gory scene involving four men , i opined `` ah-ha ! white t-shirts on everyone so the blood shows up . economical ! i used the same technique in my own low-budget horror film . '' jordan replied , `` no , that 's gang dress . white t-shirts were banned from new orleans bars for a time as a result . '' oh . ) a lot of the movie is set in someone 's living room , so there 's a great deal of hanging out and waiting for the zombies . but the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere -- it surpasses its budget in spirit . zombie explanation : when man plays god , zombies arise ! or , perhaps : follow fda-approved testing rules before human experimentation ! contribution to the zombie canon : this is the first zombie movie i 've seen with a drive-by shooting . as far as the actual zombies go , infection is spread with a bite as usual , but quite unusually head shots do n't work -- it 's heart shots that kill . zombies have pulses , the absence of which proves true death . and these zombies make pretty cool jaguar-growl noises . gratuitous zombie movie in-joke : a mercenary named romero . groan . favorite zombie : jaguar-noise little brother zombie , of course !
pierce brosnan the newest but no longer james bond , is an assassin . he is very very good at what he does , but he 's getting old and tired . greg kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow business man . now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives . then one night they are having drinks in a bar , and they begin to talk . then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events . the story is excellent , the acting is top notch , and the humor is hilarious i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this funny , but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see .
this is one of those film's/pilot that if you knew battlestar galactica it helps , but is n't necessary . what makes this even more believable of a story than bsg is that this is n't something so far away in the future . this has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically . the leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced & quite talented actors . eric stoltz is superb as the father who will do anything to be re-united w/his daughter however real or not she is & he 'll do it no matter the cost . paula malcomson of `` deadwood '' fame is terrific as his wife as well . you are not sure completely of his motives whether it 's love or money or both , but that is what makes this pilot even more intriguing . i see a star in the making of zoe played by the relative unknown alessandra torresani & her performance . esai morales is terrific in his desire to see his loved one again & just how wrong to be even considering what he wants more than his moral objections . i did n't think this would be a good idea when it was announced but from the pilot alone i am thrilled to see how we got to the bsg stage story . it 's great to see adama as a child already being affected & influenced by the different sorts of robots starting to permeate life at this stage . i just hope that they can keep up the stories so we can figure out even more how they got the the humanoid typed robots . this is an almost perfect pilot & i hope they can keep up the fantastic storytelling . even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen . if you have n't gotten into bsg , @ least try this & i 'll bet you become a fan & will want to see how the bsg story came to be .
this could n't have been better . the strong restraints on mike sullivan 's expressions could n't have been portrayed in any other way . tom hanks delivers the best performance of his career . young tyler hoechlin drives an emotional wheel ; playing the basis character for the story . and veteran paul newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time . this film is based on a bold graphic novel by max allan collins and richard piers rayner . this is a father/son story which basically employs the two candidates solely unfit for the roles . mike sullivan had no father as a child , so john rooney took him in . although a generous man , mr. rooney involved himself in organized crime . therefore , the debt of sullivan was only to be paid off in involving himself in the business . now , sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe , but at the same time pay back his boss . the events to follow , will test sullivan 's loyalty and embrace his family 's fate . with a great adaptation by david self , the dialogue comes out seldomly , but yet very virtuous . the story unfolds in a beautiful 1930 's setting ( brilliant art direction by richard l. johnson & nancy haigh ) covered with a dark rainy ( snow on the ground ) exterior . driving the story , is thomas newman 's wonderful irish score , settling in only when necessary . but the most important technical element in the film is conrad l. hall 's beautiful photography . this is some of the best cinematography i 've seen ; and i watch a lot of films . the scene when mike and michael are in the car , entering chicago is quite impressive . the shot starts at the front of the car , revealing mike ( hanks ) through the windshield . it subsequently dollys around to the side of the car , to see michael ( hoechlin ) awakening and peering out his side window . as it continues , it trucks sideways and dollys back , completely around the car and reveals a gorgeous scenic 1930 's chicago . with a great cast and crew , the principle man creates a brazenly amazing film . i 'm talking about sam mendes , who made his feature film debut in 1999 with american beauty . ( won him various awards ) before american beauty , mendes worked as a play director for the british theater , but decided that he wanted to move on saying that there was nothing new for him in theater . with only two films , sam mendes has marked himself in my book as one of the great directors ( in a list of about twenty-five ) . the film illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and misses and expresses the true theme brilliantly . the photography , acting and story is phenominal . i 'm still waiting for scorcesee 's gangs of new york , but for now , i 'm fully confident in saying that this is the `` best film of the year '' . considering it 's competition ( signs , insomnia , minority report ) thats a strong statement .
i was probably one of the few australians not watching the tennis when this series aired . i have to say when william mcinnes first appeared i though , that is one crappy actor ! but as the series continued he toned down his performance and i totally loved him . he was such a rotten guy but he did make me laugh . i watched the show to see hugo speers ( heart and bones , the full monty ) and tom long ( seachange , two hands ) . it was interesting to see speers play a nice , quiet man and even more interesting to watch tom longs ' rippling muscles ! sigh ... seriously , long 's performance was a total shock and really brilliant . he stole the show . martin sacks was good also in a small role , and the leading actress put in an entertaining performance . i 'd recommend this programme if you enjoy stories with a twist and watching tom long walk around with no shirt on ...
my evaluation : 8/10 i like a lot this movie . compare to today brainless movie ( just action and special effet and nothing new about ideas ) , `` soylent green '' ask to something that today does n't exist anymore : to think . well it would not a big surprise a day human eat `` cookies '' which are create with body of human . with all what happen on this planet , and to see how people are so indifferent to all , this kind of future is possible . sure this movie take some age but the idea behind the movie is actual again . rich at paradise , other in the hell . well a luck today they are tv and idiocy like `` reality show '' . tv is a good wash brain . it 's pity to see that intelligence of human have not progress like technologies . since writing all stop . if you like reality show this movie is not for you . if you believe all politician same too . if you do n't like ask yourself question about now and future well never look this movie .
james stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge which ties in with the fate of the films other star the winchester rifle . stewart is it goes without saying excellent adding some cold hard obsession to his usual laid back cowboy . the story follows the fate of a winchester rifle and its owners after being won in a competition by our hero and stolen by the man he is hunting . we meet a selection of gamblers , gun fighters , indian traders and bank robers as we follow the rifles path through indian battles , bank heists etc . the supporting cast are all solid with dan durya standing out as waco johnny dean the live-wire gunfighter with an itchy trigger finger . also as a trivia note a very early appearance from rock hudson as an indian chief . the end showdown is a classic a tense rifle battle fought at long range in and around a rocky outcrop . throw in some good old western action , fist fights , shootouts and horseback chases it makes for a rollicking western adventure . 8/10
this movie did n't really surprise me , as such , it just got better and better . i thought : `` paul rieser wrote this , huh ? well ... we 'll see how he does ... '' then i saw peter falk was in it . i appreciate colombo . even though i was never a big fan of the show , i 've always liked watching peter falk . the performances of peter and paul were so natural that i felt like a fly on the wall . they played off of each other so well that i practically felt giddy with enjoyment ! ... and i had n't even been drinking ! this movie was so well done that i wanted to get right on the phone to paul and let him know how much i enjoyed it ! but i could n't find his number . must be unlisted or something . this was one of those movies that i had no idea what it was going to be about or who was in it or anything . it just came on and i thought : '' eh , why not ? let 's see . if i do n't like it - i do n't have to watch it ... '' ... and i ended up just loving it !
one of the most nihilistic and brutal films i 've ever seen , but also one of the most tragic and moving ones . this is an action-melodrama like the world has never seen it before . sometimes the plot got me close to tears , while in the next moment delivering shocking revelations like a bone-crunching blow to the guts . chilling performance by edison chen . the story of a hk-cop and a cambodian killer hunting each other down , while bit by bit losing their humanity , is a strong one . featuring very little dialog in favor of haunting imagery and gritty camera-work , `` dog bite dog '' is pure hk-bloodshed without the heroism .
this is an excellent film for female body-builder & female action fans ! i think that sue price did a great job in this film series ( nemesis 2,3,4 ) and proved to be a great fighter . she has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful nebula ( nemesis 2 ) . though not a film of great value and sue price 's acting skills not the best to have met in my life , the movie itself was something awesome , a priceless gem for fans of female body-builder action ! well , some parts of nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci-fi films , such as terminator or predator , but that 's not the point . the point is that a.puyn casted in that film a very talented body-builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do . i really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm nemesis 3 ( a rather boring sequel ) and nemesis 4 ( a much more interesting sequel than 3 ) . what a pity it has n't shown yet on dvd : - (
this is a great movie that i do n't think gets enough credit as saturday night fever or grease in john travolta 's career . he plays a man who is in love with a girl but is too pig headed to admit his feelings to her . instead , he wants to engage in mechanical bull riding because he thinks it will show his manhood . even though it was made in 1980 , it is still timely today . the great country music soundtrack is terrific . 10/10
one of the best love stories i have ever seen . it is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion , but lovely nonetheless ... big edie and little edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly , and are infinitely quotable : `` it 's a goddamned beautiful day , now will you just shut up ? '' the opening explanation of little edie 's costume only promises that the movie will live on forever , and so will big edie `` the world famous singer '' and little edie `` the world famous dancer . ''
thanks should be given to the hong kong vcd/dvd distributors that i only paid us $ 1.4 and i could have such a surprisingly delightful enjoyment . adultery ? how common in our modern days . eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped nick to chase after luis and charlotte to italy . she wants her revenge done but at the end , she also commits the same crime of luis : she had sex with nick . in this small indie production , vivian naefe dealt with the teething problems in modern marriage with a light heart . how can one dare treat marriage seriously in this fast-food time where people are now of higher mobility in physical , mental and technology areas ? conjugal commitment asks for too high a price that most people would choose to succumb to circumstances . nick once trusted charlotte but he fell for eva after that kidnap journey which forced him to experience much growth . most viewers may feel happy about the ending because eva and nick come together , well , this should be the greatest retribution to the unfaithful act of their spouses . however , i want a sequel , i want to see how the four would develop after this exchange . perhaps they may exchange back , how can one be so sure about the shaky love relationship . good acting and good scenery . the two little child-actors should not be neglected especially the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in venezia . and of course , how can we forget the `` bella , bella '' scenery of the city .
mesmerizing , breathtaking and horrifying , this hauntingly beautiful film is the `` apocalypse now '' without fiction . slow in pace , quiet in mood , it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom . there is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease . greed , the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress , has turned us into something like cancer , on its way to consume the host and die with it ... manufactured landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least i 'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again .
i have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel `` jane eyre '' . both dalton and clarke are very believable as rochester and jane . i 've seen other versions , but none compare to this one . the best one for me . i could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again . the last time i saw this one was in 1984 when i was only 13 . at that time , i was a bookworm and i had just read charlotte bronte 's novel . i was completely enchanted by this miniseries and i remember not missing any of the episodes . i 'd like to see it again because it 's so good . : - )
at first glance , it would seem natural to compare where the sidewalk ends with laura . both have noirish qualities , both were directed by otto preminger , and both star dana andrews and gene tierney . but that 's where most of the comparisons end . laura dealt with posh , sophisticated people with means who just happen to find themselves mixed-up in a murder . where the sidewalk ends is set in a completely different strata . these are people with barely two nickels to rub together who are more accustomed to seeing the underbelly of society than going to fancy dress parties . where the sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or some other weapon . small-time hoods are a dime-a-dozen and cops routinely beat confessions out of the crooks . getting caught-up in a murder investigation seems as natural as breathing . while i have n't seen his entire body of work , based on what i have seen , dana andrews gives one of his best performances as the beat-down cop , det . sgt . mark dixon . he 's the kind of cop who is used to roughing up the local hoods if it gets him information or a confession . one night , he goes too far and accidentally kills a man . he does his best to cover it up . but things get complicated when he falls for the dead man 's wife , morgan taylor ( tierney ) , whose father becomes suspect number one in the murder case . as morgan 's father means the world to her , dixon 's got to do what he can to clear the old man without implicating himself . technically , where the sidewalk ends is outstanding . besides the terrific performance from andrews , the movie features the always delightful tierney . she has a quality that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter . the rest of the cast is just as solid with tom tully as the wrongly accused father being a real standout . beyond the acting , the direction , sets , lighting , and cinematography are all top-notch . overall , it 's an amazingly well made film . if i have one complaint ( and admittedly it 's a very , very minor quibble ) it 's that tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings . it 's a little difficult to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixed-up with some of these unsavory characters . it 's not really her fault , it 's just the way tierney comes across . she seems a little too beautiful , polished , and delicate for the part . but , her gentle , kind , trusting nature add a sense of needed realism to her portrayal .
` castle of blood ' ( aka ` castle of terror ' ) is a well-crafted , surprisingly spooky entry from italian director anthony dawson . exquisite black and white cinematography , flawless dubbing , superb casting , fairly logical scripting , deliberate pacing and a surprise ( though totally appropriate ) ending set this one apart . only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt ` love at first sight ' between elizabeth ( barbara steele ) and alan ( georges rivière ) mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie . while visiting england , edgar allan poe sits in a pub , telling one of his ghostly stories to count blackwood . recognizing the great writer , alan , a young news reporter , requests an interview with poe . during the course of the conversation , poe reveals that all of his stories are true . incredulous , alan expresses his skepticism about life after death . count blackwood offers to bet alan 100 pounds that he can not survive this night in blackwood 's castle , a night following halloween when the dead walk . alan can not afford the bet , so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager . unlike mario bava 's overpraised ` black sunday , ' ( aka ` the mask of satan ' ) , ` castle of blood ' is fairly restrained , making the few moments of violence even more dreadful , especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible italian space movies from the 60s . it 's a pity the only version of this film i 've found is badly deteriorated ( and recorded ) pan and scan version . even so , it is well worth seeing , and cries out for a modern remake , perhaps with christina ricci or jennifer love hewitt in the role of elizabeth . watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with robert wise 's ` the haunting ' .
cuban blood is one of those sleeper films that has a lot to say about life in a very traditional way . i actually watched it while sailing around cuba on a western caribbean cruise . it details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution . not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end , when the socialist regime came and took the property of the boy 's father . the majority of the film is the boy 's coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else . there are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to . a class a film with fine acting and directing . this is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists . it is a film about people and their lives , their mistakes , and their triumphs . a good film worth watching several times annually .
henri verneuil 's film may be not so famous as parallax view , 3 days of the condor or jfk but it is certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic representatives of the genre . action takes place in fictional western state where fictional president has been killed . after several years of investigation , special government commission decides that president was killed by a lone gunman . but one man - prosecutor volney , played by yves montand - thinks there 's something more to be investigated and so the film starts . this movie does n't deal with some exact theories , but it embraces the whole structure of relationship between government and society in today 's world . such film could be made only in the 1970-ies but it will never lose it 's actuality . furthermore , it 's even a bit frightful how precise are it 's oracles . 10 out of 10 .
did you ever wonder how far one movie could go ? schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of the extreme with harry russo . harry is an aggravated writer , killer and drug addict scumbag who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and insanity . driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck , harry begins his killing spree . from director ron atkins comes the 1st installment of the vilest story ever to be filmed the only other movie i have seen similar to this would happen to be the 2nd installment entitled schizophreniac necromaniac this is a really low budget film and will not be for everyone , but if you are looking for something disturbing , different and horrific then this would make a fine choice . do not expect anything like modern day horror ( such as scream ) viewer discretion is advised
as a long-standing barbra fan , any posting like this will be biased . that aside , this film ranks as a classic . it has it 's flaws ( emphasized in other postings ) , but gives a glimpse of a time ( late 70s ) that will never be there again , and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen . streisand fought hard to make this movie her own . i do n't think she was ever satisfied . but it gives her fans a new barbra ( for the time ) with live singing , a young fresh appearance , and some very heavy-duty acting . the story is rough , but exciting , and holds your interest throughout . the extended one frame `` finale '' is hard for most non-barbra fans to sit through , but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent .
i happen to run into this movie one night so i decided to watch it ! i was very pleased with the movie ... i thought it was a wonderful plot . it 's a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say ! and this wife stayed devoted for 23 years ! ! ! i thought it was a great movie ! !
i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title . this movie is not primarily about the act of `` riding giants , '' but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport , riding giants , to change the emphasis . in my teens i lived a block from the wedge , one of the hardest-breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world . i 've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf , and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions . that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film . the idea that jeff clark , to all appearances a normal mortal , could get away with riding maverick 's by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp . the first safety rule of any water sport is `` never surf/dive/swim by yourself . '' he went where sane people would not , and lived to tell about it . i would n't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left . in the world of warm water : the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body . these are not just scary waves , these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation waves . when we see laird hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves ( i can hardly type those numbers ) , but actually working the faces like a fun day at rincon , i 'm blown away . there is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world . this a great film . i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside the hamilton/kalama crew , and i think they deserved mention . splice in ken bradshaw at outside log cabins and a 10 it is !
i am writing this after just seeing the perfect son at the 2002 gay and lesbian mardi gras film festival in sydney , australia . when their father dies , two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from aids , they enter on a heart warming journey of reconciliation . the two leads do a magnificent job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses . i do have one qualm about the movie though - whilst the brother who is dying acts sick , he does n't look it . a person of 0 t4 cells would look quite ill - not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed . a small gripe , but one that makes it a bit less realistic . despite that one small gripe , the perfect son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it- do . i 'm hoping for a dvd release in the near future !
the premise of the story is simple : an old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child , and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred . though very little dialog is provided throughout the film , the visual narrative told by the camera 's eye alone made the film quite engaging . the setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness , which complements the quietness of the characters themselves . we can also sense helplessness in the old man 's inability to convince the police of the murder , which parallels the silenced child 's inability to tell her own story . true horror lies in feelings of hopelessness , helplessness , and irrationality . this film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone , rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak . cleverly , the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments . the ending is also unexpected and believable . reminiscent of japanese horror films , such as `` the ring , '' and `` dark water , '' or english horror films , such as `` lady in black , '' and `` the innocents , '' this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror . i recommend anyone who enjoys a good chilling to the bone scare to give this film a try . by the way , if you have n't seen the films i just mentioned above , you might want to give them a try as well .
i saw this film a while back and it 's still at the top of my 'favorite movies ' list . it is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits ( such as the 'cafe bustelo ' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair ) that people are n't seeing because you will not understand this movie unless you are hispanic . this is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular . please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it 's being built upon . i completely see what the writer/director was going for , and he hit the target perfectly ! this film is highly deserving of a better rating .
i work with children from 0  6 years old and they all love the doodlebops . the doodlebops are energetic , vibrant and appealing . once they start singing , `` we 're the doodlebops we 're the doodlebops we 're the doodlebops oh yeah come and join the fun because we 're laughing and we 're singing all day '' it is almost impossible not to join them in song . the doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun . each show is an adventure , the doodlebops do not try to change the world with preachy messages all they do is have fun while sorting out everyday life challenges that the young child may relate to . the doodlebops is an refreshing , high action alternative to regular children 's television programs .
this independent film was one of the best films at the tall grass film festival that i have ever seen there i loved it there are so many things that was great about the film on top of all that the cast and crew that i had the opportunity to meet were absolutely phenomenal.i thought that avi did a great job in his role . and ricky ullman was absolutely true to his role for a disney actor i was amazed at his talent to be able to go from cheesy teen comedy to such an adult role with no problems the talent in the film was just amazing the cinematography was just great if you want to see an independent film this is one really that you should see.i think that mr gruver would have been so proud to have such a submission in his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite they went and saw it again . this truly was a great film it was dark and funny and sad and truly emotional it was just fabulous . i am honestly just so enthused by this film and i really do n't want to spoil it for any one just see it and truly be amazed at it i think that these film makers really have what it takes to go places and i hope to see more work from them in the future .
to make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about kip ( giovanni ribsi ) , a car thief , who messes up a big delivery of stolen cars ( 50 in total ) . he is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the order ' . the objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days , with the help of randall ( nicolas cage ) , a retired ' booster and also kip 's brother and a couple of old friends of randall 's . as you can see this is the same old , big bro ' needs to get lil ' bro ' out of trouble routine and of course randall is the best thief there ever was . of course as in all other movies there are also a few setbacks and surprises you never would have thought of , but at times it is predictable too , so there is nothing fancy about the story . you are by now probably wondering why this is about 51 times the hot stuff , since there are only 50 beautiful , fast , cool and expensive cars to be stolen . well the other hot item in this film is sway ( angelina jolie ( who will be a big star ( trust me ) ) ) . she is not only very convincing in the role as a car theft , but she is pretty hot too . ok not hot as in pretty , but hot as in damn cool and sexy . she was very believable in this role , probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too ( do n't believe me , read her biography ) and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man . i only know , that she plays the kind of girl i like in this film , because she is not too mainstream , a bit alternative look and she even comes with a tattoo . ok the only downsides i felt while watching this movie was , that there is not very much action , there is one totally unrealistic scene , the story is only ok and that there are not much jokes . hey but after seeing the whole film i must say : who cares . why must i say that , well because it was still entertaining ; had a couple of cool car chases ; good music ; some bruckheimer scenes ( where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet ) ; good actors who all did their jobs ; pretty cars ; one cool , wild , sexy lady ( yes , i mean mrs. jolie ) and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with . so some downsides here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie . all in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall ok movie with a cool  feelgood ending . as for nicolas cage , well he is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as the rock , con air , face / off , snake eyes and finally this one . plus what actor has had so many good action / thriller 's in the last years and such successful ones ? well no one ! ! ! maybe jackie chan , but he is one of my favourites too . one thing that is true though about mr. cages bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse . the rock , was a clear 9 , con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7 . not that that mark is bad . does it not show that his films under bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies ? no it does n't show us that , because almost all of cage 's films were successful in the last few years , except for 8mm and bringing out the dead . 8mm was not great , i admit that , but that was never cage 's fault and the story seemed good to me . about the latter film i can not say anything , cause i have not seen it yet . one thing though i know for sure , if bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films , i would have said yes to all of them . i would have said yes to the rock , because the story was great and because you would get to play with sean connery and ed harris . i would have said yes to con air , because there would be a lot of action in it , because the story was good and because you got to act with john malkovich and ving rhames . in this one i would have starred because i would have gotten a big paycheque , i would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because i would have been able to kiss angelina jolie ( ca n't wait to see her in that lara croft outfit ) . this one was a good choice of mr. cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre . 7 out of 10
forbidden planet is the best sf film from the golden age of sf cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder . as soon as the spaceship lands the audience - via the ships human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure . we meet the unforgetable robbie , the mysterious dr morbuis , his beautiful and innocent daughter altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - the krell who died out overnight . or did they ? you can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia i feel and bebe and louis barron ` s electronic music adds even more atmosphere i ` m shocked this film isn ` t in the top 250 imdb films .
halfway through lajos koltai 's `` evening , '' a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination : `` can you tell me where my life went ? '' the line could be embarrassingly theatrical , but the woman speaking it is vanessa redgrave , delivering it with utter simplicity , and the question tears your heart out . time and again , the film based on susan minot 's novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness , it holds attention , offers admirable performances , and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have . with only six months of the year gone , there are now two memorable , meaningful , worthwhile films in theaters , the other , of course , being sara polley 's `` away from her . '' hollywood might have turned `` evening '' into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters - vanessa redgrave and natasha richardson , and meryl streep and mamie gummer . richardson is redgrave 's daughter in the film ( with a sister played by tony collette ) , and gummer plays streep 's younger self , while redgrave 's youthful incarnation is claire danes . add glenn close , eileen atkins , hugh dancy , patrick wilson , and a large cast - yes , it could have turned into a multiple star platform . instead , koltai - the brilliant hungarian cinematographer of `` mephisto , '' and director of `` fateless '' - created a subtle ensemble work with a `` continental feel , '' the story taking place in a high-society newport environment , in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble . missed connections , wrong choices , and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera , but the quality of the writing , koltai 's direction , and selfless acting raise `` evening '' way above that level , into the the rarified air of english , french ( and a few american ) family sagas from a century before its contemporary setting . complex relationships between mothers and daughters , between friends and lovers , with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly , understandably , captivatingly . individual tunes are woven into a symphony . and yet , with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances , the stars of `` evening '' still shine through , redgrave , richardson , gummer ( an exciting new discovery , looking vaguely like her mother , but a very different actress ) , danes carrying most of the load - until streep shows up in the final moments and , of course , steals the show . dancy and wilson are well worth the price of admission too . as with `` away from her , '' `` evening '' stays with you at length , inviting a re-thinking its story and characters , and re-experiencing the emotions it raises . at two hours , the film runs a bit long , but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn .
i sit through movies like `` tiempo de valientes '' and i want to talk about cinema for hours . the admiration this movie caused me is beyond my own limits of explanation , because i 'm watching the scenes of the film and i search inside my thoughts for film-making ideas and dialogue innovations that could emerge from something bigger than damian szifron 's mind . looking the environment , so uncompromised , so simple , i 'm thinking ; this man is a genius . no wonder he created what is probably the best television show argentina ever witnessed , and then a first movie full of elements some contemporary directors have n't still achieved . `` el fondo del mar '' is the name and , it awakened ( a few years ago ) , my enthusiasm for our everyday cinema . starting his journey from people 's daily real lives , szifron goes where pablo trapero never could in `` el bonaerense '' ; the federal police department 's life . trapero 's film was a journey into a man 's mind and experiences , not into the places he saw . yes , there was a detailed training and lots of crime situations , but szifron in `` in there '' , his is more of a detective story , like the ones we know and love , with the mysteries and the thrilling music . but there 's a lot of humanity in his writing , and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters , alfredo díaz and mariano silverstein . there are a lot of actors of great caliber in the film , but these two actors are the ones the film ca n't do without . the first character ( luis luque ) is a detective that has just found out his wife cheats on him ; and has to work on a case . the second one is a psychiatrist that is assigned the treatment of the detective . he wants to deal with him in regular sessions but the sheriff takes advantage of the time disposition and suggests he joins díaz in his routines : `` it 's nothing , the usual stuff ; no problem '' . but it is bigger than that , and it will unfold a part of the doctor 's personality he did n't know . the relationship developed between the two leads ca n't be explained unless it is observed , because it regards such a complexity that demonstrates how talented are some men like szifron that are trying , today , to leave a signature in our history . reaching points of unbelievable spontaneity , during a high pressure situation , díaz tells silverstein : `` how do we continue our treatment ? `` , and silverstein answers : `` no , i 'm not your doctor . you call me to have dinner ; i 'm your friend '' : we laugh because we ca n't help it . and we ca n't help laughing when díaz crashes a car in the street and does n't gives importance to it , or when he trespasses all the red lights in the street , or when he smokes pot in his police patrol and silverstein ca n't believe it ( but then smokes it too because he 's screwed up ) ; or when silverstein tries to be friendly with díaz 's robber friends . magic from diego peretti is what we receive there . he , a psychiatrist himself , gives a performance in plan `` locas de amor '' , but impresses with all his range . luis luque on the other hand , is back on track with a top-notch portrayal that reminds us the great actor he is . there 's a passion i have for this , and as i said , i could write about it for hours , but unfortunately that 's not the way it works and i have to be precise and summarize . although i have to watch a lot of the old movies and study them , i could assure that `` tiempo de valientes '' is the comedy argentina had been waiting for and never got until now .
north africa in the 1930 's . to a small arab town on the edge of the sahara comes a beautiful woman looking for meaning to her life & a handsome trappist monk fleeing from his crisis of faith . they will meet and passions will be stirred , but not even the sand diviner knows if they will find happiness or sorrow , here , in the garden of allah . the plot is pure hokum , but the film is still great fun & beautiful to look at . marlene dietrich & charles boyer are a superb screen couple . she is , to put it simply , gorgeous , and boyer gives a most effective , understated performance , letting his sensitive face do much of his acting for him . the supporting cast is excellent : basil rathbone , in a sympathetic role as a count who loves the desert ; joseph schildkraut as a friendly , talkative guide ( all the `` arabic '' he & others speak in the film is pure gibberish ) ; lucile watson as a gentle mother superior ; alan marshal as an honorable young french officer ; tilly losch as a dangerous dancer ; henry brandon as a comic porter ; john carradine as the mysterious sand diviner ; and magnificent sir c. aubrey smith as a wise old priest . movie mavens will recognize helen jerome eddy as a nun ; marcia mae jones & bonita granville ( peeking over the nun 's shoulder ) as convent girls ; gaunt nigel de brulier as a monastery lector ; and ferdinand gottschalk as a hotel clerk , all uncredited . color films of the 1930 's are both rare & lovely to look at , and this movie is no exception - the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself . the garden of allah was the first technicolor film to be shot on location . yuma , arizona gave the film makers all the sand dunes they could desire , but contaminated drinking water & 135 degree heat soon had the company in revolt . when the daily rushes showed boyer 's face had burned a bright tomato red , producer david o. selznick finally gave in . the remainder of the film was shot on a hollywood sound stage .
an excellent documentry . i personally remember this growing up in nyc in the early 80 's . this movie is for anyone that was n't around during that time period.this shows the one thing the african american gay underclass felt was solely theirs and the love and camadrie you see is real . the people are real and sadly few are still alive as this is being written . the balls are still held but not to the extent that they were in the the nineteen eighties . that time is gone forever . this is a good pre `` homo thug '' movie . when queens were really proud to be extroverts . goodbye to storyville this is another era gone but greatly documented all hail film !
the h.g . wells classic has had several incarnations . the 05 ' speilburg version and the classic 53 ' version but only this one stays completely true to the book . nothing is changed nothing is removed . originally released as a 3-hour film . the director re-cut the film down to 2-hours of pure excellence . its got a chapter by chapter visualization of the novels pages that `` wells would be proud of '' the story is as everyone remembers . martians invade the earth with capsules containing an army of tripod walking war machines . the people of 19th century earth are ill-prepared to repel the alien forces and fight back with canons and guns who mes shells bound right off the walkers and when humanity is no longer a world wide power they are saved by the smallest of organisms on earth . the film is an excellent accomplishment for director timothy hines who has great potential as he brought this vision to life with a meager 5 million budget . today b-movies have larger budgets .
it is one of the better indian movies i have seen lately , instead of crappy song and dance or slum dog movies . all the actors have showed the right emotions at the right intensity with right timing . it is the hallmark of a good movie , that it make the viewer go back and research the subject , which exactly what i did checking on harilal . i always enjoy akshay khanna 's subtle style of acting and interestingly he had rather a complicated relationship with his own father vinod khanna , albeit not as dramatic as gandhis and wonder how it helped him essay this character . i was impressed by the direction and 2 thumbs up for anil kapoor for producing such a classy movie .
caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels , and was so intrigued i sought out the next showing . i really did n't know what to expect after reading the program summary , but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and distressed . it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80 's , a little better insight into what our kids have to contend with these days . the fact that you do n't see the shooting only adds to the chillness of the plot . to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming . and will admit that i shed quite a few tears throughout . on the whole , not a movie that i would seek out to what , however i am sure glad i did see it .
a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store . after he 's done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he 'll be transferring soon . bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy ... and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals . animals like say , a certain rabbit . this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer . i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940 's . it still remains as funny nearly 60+ years later . this animated short can be seen on disc 1 of the looney tunes golden collection volume 2 . my grade : a-
after the usual chase scene , jerry accidentally winds up inside a bottle of invisible ink , which was part of a chemistry set . he quickly discovers he 's invisible ... so the predictable results occur , meaning he uses his new hidden condition to torment tom . jerry often is just defending himself , but often he has sadistic streak in him that torments the cat whenever possible , even when unprovoked . here , he makes tom think his eyes are deceiving him when cheese from a mousetrap disappears before his eyes , or milk from a dish . tom ca n't take anymore so he tries to sleep this nightmare off , but jerry sets fire to his paw ! man , i hope little kids did n't ideas watching these cartoons back in the '40s and '50s ! i always found jerry , the little mouse , more evil than cute . thankfully , in cartoons , generally , whatever damage a character suffers is gone within seconds and he 's back to normal . the best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way through when tom figures out what the story is with jerry , and tries different methods to detect where the mouse is located ( such as putting flour on the floor to see his footprints ) .
this is a comedy of morals , so occasionally a gentle touch of bitterness occurs , but a lightness soften all sarcasm and irony flows till all of a sudden one moment will halt your heart and changes everything . this film , marvelously written and directed , is a gem that shines perfectly , with beautiful acting by all . jean-louis trintignant is exquisite as usual , and romy schneider is a pearl , perfect and glowing , that is not to be missed . a truly wonderful film ! !
the 60 's is a great movie ( i saw it completely in one night ) about the hippy movement in the late 60 's . although the title would suggest otherwise the first 5 years of the 60 's are not really important in this film . the main character of the movie is michael , a political activist who goes on the road in the us against the vietnam-war . there he meets his girlfriend , sarah.michael 's brother , brian , goes to vietnam to fight ( what a surprise ! ) .he comes back from the war and changes in a `` tom cruise born on the fourth of july '' look a like and then into a hippy.his dad is a pro-vietnam war type of guy ( what a surprise ! ! ) .michael 's sister kate gets pregnant from a rock & roll artist and runs away from home and goes to san francisco during the summer of love . the ending is very poor ( father becomes a liberal and everybody is happy ) , but i let this slip away from my vote ( the rest of the movie is very good ! ) . the performances by the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant . all the main events of the sixties are in the movie , like the murders on jfk and martin luther king aswell as the big hippy protests , the summer of love and woodstock ! look closely for wavy '' woodstock speaker '' gravy ( what we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400.000 ! ) as a first aid employee at the woodstock festival ! in the end , the 60 's is a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade ! 10/10
mitchell leisen 's fifth feature as director , and he shows his versatility by directing a musical , after his previous movies were heavy dramas . he also plays a cameo as the conductor . you can tell it is a pre code movie , and nothing like it was made in the us for quite a while afterwards ( like 30+ years ) . leisen shot the musical numbers so they were like what the audience would see - no widescreen shots or from above ala busby berkeley . what i do find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience . as others have mentioned the leads are fairly characterless , and jack oakie and victor mclaghlan play their normal movie personas . gertrude michael however provides a bit of spark . the musical numbers are interesting and some good ( the rape of the rhapsody in particular is amusing ) but the drama unconvincing and faked - three murders is too many and have minimal emotional impact on the characters . this is where this movie could have been a lot better .
i had been looking forward to how to lose friends & alienate people for months , particularly due to the fact that kirsten dunst and simon pegg were starring . simon pegg is a comedic genius and kirsten dunst has always been a favorite actress of mine . how to lose friends & alienate people hit the spot ! of course not perfect , but very enjoyable and funny . how to lose friends & alienate people follows the life of sidney young , a smalltime , bumbling , british celebrity journalist , who is hired by an upscale magazine in new york city . in spectacular fashion sidney enters high society and burns bridges with bosses , peers and superstars . after disrupting one black-tie event by allowing a wild pig to run rampant , sidney catches the attention of clayton harding , editor of sharp , and accepts a job with the magazine in new york city . clayton warns sidney that he 'd better impress and charm everyone he can , if he wants to succeed . instead , sidney instantly insults and annoys fellow writer alison olsen ( kirsten dunst ) . he dares to target the star clients of power publicist eleanor johnson ( gillian anderson ) . he also upsets his direct boss lawrence maddox ( danny huston ) . sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone . his saving grace , a rising starlet sophie maes ( megan fox ) who develops an odd affection for him . in time , allison 's friendship might be the only thing saving sydney from his downward spiraling career . the storyline is very interesting and the acting was top notch with what the actors were given . simon pegg is still hilarious as ever ! he makes sydney bumbling , obnoxious , and annoying as real as it gets , but later in time making sydney not just likable , but also a real character who you root for in the end . kirsten dunst and jeff bridges were brilliant ! kirsten had some very wonderful acting and hilarious scenes , and jeff bridges is just jeff f * cking bridges ! how can you not like him ? ! he makes clayton a very humorous character with some wit and overall you just love the guy . gillian anderson , megan fox , and danny huston were great as the supporting cast . each had their own personality that were overall pretty unlikable , but that 's what just made the film work . one thing i did n't enjoy was how one dimensional some of the characters were . i understand that most were the supporting cast , but some of the cast was underused and could 've given the film some more spice to it . how to lose friends & alienate people will never be on anyone 's top 10 films ever , or even top 10 comedies ever , but it has a very high entertainment level and some scenes may even charm you as well . how to lose friends & alienate people is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the year ! 8/10
this short is a puzzlement . words fail me here , as this is almost indescribable , technically exceptional after more than 90 years ( the visuals are remarkable and even occasionally amazing ) , this is not something you watch if you like things that are mundane or `` normal'-because it most certainly is not either . this be an odd one , gang . well worth checking out , but if things like ren and stimpy make your head hurt , you may want to skip this . recommended .
this is te cartoon that should have won instead of country cousin . visually well-done and much more entertaining and memorable . worth watching just for the music alone ! although there are elements that undoubtably will bruise the sensibilities of some these days , the cartoon has to be given a bit of perspective . it 's over sixty years old and it is , after all , just a cartoon . i 'm disabled and if i were as hyper-sensitive as the folks who look at things like this cartoon and take umbrage , i would have long since curled up in a fetal position and faded away . sometimes you need to lighten up , put your head back and float ! caricatures of celebrities in cartoons were common in the 1930s and 1940s and were almost never terribly flattering . bing crosby reportedly hated it when he was used on more than one occasion . * sigh *
this film seems to be well remembered as the time tom & jerry signed a peace treaty . things are idyllic for a time but , predictably , it goes sour . probably the most memorable moment was the endless fight involving a pipe , a frying pan , and a baseball bat that the two plus butch the dog engage in at the beginning and end of the short . i enjoyed one a bunch and you should try to catch it on cartoon network .
this is so exciting ! after i saw `` la roue '' this afternoon , a short , light-hearted little movie , i consider this one a real treat ! this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year . it is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the 30 's to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema . it 's simply filled with music and an adorable mood that 's really upbeat and , bottom line , it made me happy ! obviously it would n't be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for , but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i did n't even think of it twice . the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers , possibly the biggest comedic force of the time . this is rather perfect .
i was n't sure when i heard about this coming out . i was thinking how dumb is disney getting . i was wrong . i found it to be very good . i mean it 's not the lion king but it 's cool to see another side from a certain point . it was very funny . also it was n't one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks , it was just like the lion king animation . the only thing that eritated me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie . not to give anything way but you 'll know what i am talking about . i also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return . it was a very good movie over all .
tommy jones and matt dillon do the gambling world proud . the various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself . there are a few surprises . as cynical as we are today , i fully expected the 'good girl ' to be crying over his grave , instead of his buddy 's . especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend ' , when she first meets matt . and then of course you expect matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in mr. allen 's face , blinding him ( interesting role by bruce dern ) . wrrrooonnnnggg ! ! ! some of the other hollywood endings do happen , but the writing is so excellent , the acting so carefully wrought that you 're blissfully unaware . and the music is out of this world . taking us back to the 50s when our 'native passions ' were first being unleashed by the music of ray charles and bo diddley . even a little racism raring its ugly head in chicago , but at a club called , wonderfully , 'biloxi ' with a confederate flag backing up the racist remarks . i 'll be watching it again , just to hear the music . good thing i have the factotum sound track , so i can listen to that in the car . watch both together , and you 'll see how matt has matured .... playing bar room characters in both . now that he owns a bar in the paramount hotel in nyc , he probably has great opportunity to do his studies . great actor , just coming into his own . he shows finely nuanced performances ... the good and the bad in his characters . his 'young boy off the farm ' is a great study , made especially poignant because of his bassett-hound eyes . he makes love , convincingly as well . since he was in several movies with diane lane as a teen-ager , i wonder how that it ... making love to an actress you kinda grew up with . adds conviction , i 'll say that .
man on fire tells a story of an ex-special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom . at first he 's not to friendly , but then they befriend with each other , he decides to stop drinking etc. , etc ... then one day she gets kidnapped ... and killed ... and he , wo n't stop at anything to get the revenge . that 's basically the story of man on fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry . that 's also because of the great music harry-gregson williams with lisa gerrard ( gladiator ) composed . but the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... the thing is , everything here is perfect . first - acting . denzel washington is at his best , mickey rourke and christopher walken good as always , great radtha mitchell and amazing young dakota fanning . and that 's not the end of the list ... then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing , should have won an oscar for sure . the story is ... not just a revenge movie . the story is intelligent , the story makes you think ... and is pure beautiful . really . this is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime , at least once !
this movie has a great message , a impressive cast , ellen burstyn , samantha mathis , jodelle ferland ( was 4 years old when she made this movie ) ellen burstyn and jodelle ferland have both been nominated for best actress in a tv drama at the up-coming emmy awards in new york , peter masterson-director- has been nominated best director tv drama at the emmy awards also . april 1 , 2001 , jodelle ferland 'won ' , best actress in a tv drama , at the young artist awards , in studio city , ca . i can see why they have 3 nominations . mermaid is a true story , during the cridits they have the real family on the set , something you do n't see often . you can find mermaid at all blockbuster video stores . do watch it , you 'll be glad you did .
house of games has a strong story where obsession and illusion play a big part . a psychologist offers to help a patient with his gambling debts and gets caught at the game . have you ever felt fascination for something that was both dangerous and wrong ? watch what happens if you pursue this urge and go all the way . sit on the edge of your chair as tricksters are being tricked and victims turn into perpetrators . you 're never sure of who is exactly who in this movie . this is both a quality and a drawback of the script . as the movie ends you feel that the story lacks a bit of consistency . but all this is largely compensated by the excellent psychological development . this is definitely one of the best movies about gambling .
first off , i 'm not some justin timberlake fangirl obsessed with making him look good , in fact i 'm not even a huge justin fan , but i did like this movie . i work at a video store and when i saw this movie with its huge cast that i 'd never even heard of i had to see what it was about . i did n't find justin 's acting that bad , it was clearly the worst out of the group , but it 's a pretty impressive group , with cary elwes and dylan mcdermott being two names that did n't even make the first credits list . the story is basic , a journalist uncovering corrupt cops , but i found it well done . l l cool j 's character was clearly conflicted , but i honestly did n't know what he would do in the end . morgan freeman is as always , the wise mentor figure he does so well , and as much as i love kevin spacey , he was kind of just there . his character did n't have a whole lot of substance , but it 's kevin spacey , he can do no wrong . surprisingly i thought dylan mcdermott gave the best performance as a homicidal cop . truly believable and really in character , he freaked me out a couple of times . i was really expecting a lot of cheesiness to be honest . horrible catchphrases , unjustified action sequences , stuff like that , but it was surprisingly well done and i did n't find any of that . every shooting had a point , it was n't clichéd , pretty solid really . overall , amazing cast , decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump . i do n't know why it did n't appear in theatres , it was better than some garbage i 've seen on the big screen . i would say it 's worth seeing .
a well-made and imaginative production , refreshingly free from cliché , this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions : the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage . expertly directed by alan gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement , the film provides freshness in nearly every scene , as felon martin steckert ( richard harris ) , believing that his rejection for parole was particularly undeserved , contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan , following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood . often bursting into song or dancing a few steps , the capricious steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive and , as police close in for an inevitable showdown , the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their responses to forms of rejection , as discerned by a psychiatrist ( lindsay wagner ) assigned to aid a zealous police lieutenant ( james coburn ) who is in charge of the manhunt for steckert and his `` prisoner '' . this is an engrossing story , worth telling , a quickly-paced and novel adventure that profits from a capital performance by harris , fine turns from wagner , coburn , and karen black , along with justin henry as the snatched lad , with an appropriately whimsical score contributed by wilfred josephs , and top-notch cinematography by frank watts , with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal ontario province .
first off , i 'd like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the best picture academy award was 'gigi ' in 1958 . that is misinformation as 'west side story ' won in 1962 , 'my fair lady ' won in 1965 and 'sound of music ' won the year after that . that said , this film is absolutely fantastic ! the story from the novel has been somewhat altered , but that 's more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just did n't change back for a filmed version . however , i do n't mind . in fact , i rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does . i like nancy bringing oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment . the subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh . i love the moment mr. bumble and mrs. bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office . the underscore for that moment is brilliant . my three favorite actors for this film were jack wild , who plays the best dodger in any film version of the story , ron moody , a playful and humorous fagin ( this character is worked out much better than he is in the book ) , and shani wallis , who is the strongest , most distressed version of nancy . the only reason i 'm giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are 'concider yourself ' and 'who will buy . ' i always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs . it looks awful and cheesy , especially when they 're dancing at the london meat co . they should 've just done regular choreography for these scenes . however , this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us , hopefully , forever .
i was never a big fan of television until i watched 24 for the first time . i got into the series very late . season 5 ended before i even saw my very first episode . it was an episode of series 3 that was on my parents dvr ( digital video recorder ) box while i was house sitting for the weekend . it took that one episode for me to be hook line and sinker into the world of jack bauer . and boy was i hooked ! ! i watched the next six episodes without blinking an eye . the next day i went to blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited month pass for twenty something dollars and needless to say it has been the greatest blockbuster money i 've ever spent . i watched the first three seasons in three weeks . that 's 72 forty minute episodes ! ! ! i will say that finding out what happens next is easier on dvd than waiting an entire week . i can only imagine the anticipation of watching season 6 week to week ! ! i find it mildly torturous and cruel but i 'm going to give it a try and watch it just like the rest of america ! ! the dvr is set and you can bet i 'll be chomping at the bit ! !
a very strange and compelling movie . it 's about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraiser/salesman . the director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well . original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life . there is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something i do as frequently as i should . one of the more memorable films i 've seen in a long while . has n't left my mind and i look forward to future efforts by bronstein . fantastic performances all around . the simple line `` i really appreciate it . '' is now iconic to me .
this is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of trek . there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool . first the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode . they meet a freaky librarian type dude ( very well played ) . then kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like 16th century earth . mccoy and spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past . kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen , awful world by some bad guy . spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives mccoy a royal assestment whuppin ' when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out . anyhow , they all finally escape , leaving the poor cavegirl behind . it takes a ton of convincing before spock finally gives in and leaves . you can literally taste the sadness at the end . leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching . spock must have been out of his vulkin ' mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human . albeit , in a not so nice neighborhood ! anyway , you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode .... a love story , the salem witch trials , spock as a human , the desperation of being left in total isolation ... abandoned , and three entirely different settings on the alien planet . its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film . this one is a classic , do n't miss it .... i want it on dvd fer shure vulcans ! ! ! ! ! !
enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama , the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man , no doubt representing modern society . i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long . i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie , the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest . on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce 'yes sir ' and 'sorry ' into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone , they are still there .
this movie seems on the surface to be a run of mill kids movie that parents can regretfully watch with their mostly entertained little kids . the movie seems and is mostly geared towards children yet it does not stop on this level . i watched this movie first as a young child and found it to be funny , entertaining , and heartwarming and did not see it again for several years . i watched it again recently at age 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heartwarming and entertaining . this movie is highly underrated and contains many messages of real life . this movie is an inspirational quest story that is made for kids yet epic in its own right . i recommend this movie to anyone of any age .
steve carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy , first on 'the daily show ' , and then in various supporting roles . in virgin , carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths . carell plays andy stitzer , a middle aged man living a quiet , lonely life . andy is a little odd , but in an awkward nice guy sort of way . one night , while socializing with his co-workers for the first time , andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin . his co-workers , david ( paul rudd ) , jay ( romany malco ) , and cal ( seth rogen ) initially tease andy about his situation . but it 's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that andy is , and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity . and so begins andy 's quest into adulthood . andy is the quintessential innocent , and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film . some of the humor is crude gross out stuff , but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy . in addition , i found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life . i 'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama ; it 's a rolling in your seats comedy . still , every good comedy i have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters . a good comparison would be 'the wedding crashers ' from earlier this summer . virgin has a similar humor , but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes . i particularly loved the ending of the film , which i thought was a perfect way to end the flick . without giving anything away , it reminded me of 'something about mary ' . very light and fun ; it leaves you laughing and smiling , which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy . i would highly recommend .
if , like me , you like your films to be unique , and unlike the majority of other movies , then i wholly recommend that you check out the beast . the film is a grotesque , erotic , fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological 'beast ' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a french mansion and lusts after women . the film is very daring with it 's subject material , and that is something to give it credit for . the theme of bestiality is a definite taboo , and for good reason , i might add ; but the film conveys it ; straight and to the point . like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre , the beast could have gone around it , and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps , but borowczyk did n't do that , and he is brave in that respect , especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms , but the fact that he went ahead with it , in my view , means a big thumbs up for the guy . the film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female . this opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience , in some ways , for the incredible , tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see . the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking , and are bound to offend many people ( hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years ) , but these scenes are not merely an excuse for borowczyk to shock the viewer ; this film has a defining point . as said during the film ; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence . both man and beast have instincts , only man knows how to control them . the beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality ; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire , and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast . the film has strong themes of the age-old story of 'beauty and beast ' weaved into it , and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust , but not without a moral . many criticise the scenes around the film 's shocking sex sequences for being boring , but these scenes are important to the film 's story . without these scenes , we would n't get to know the characters or the story of the beast , and , most importantly ; the story of 'beauty and the beast ' would not be able to have it 's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience , and as that is one of the key elements of the film ; it would be a real shame . besides that , borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes , not with shocks , but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family , along with the beautiful shots of the mansion 's ground would not be seen , and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either . overall , the beast is a shocking film . it 's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone . however , if you can get over the film 's shock , and embrace the beast ; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance .
i would like to comment the series as a great effort . the story line although requiring a few improvements was pretty well , especially in season 1 . season 2 however became more of a freak show , and lost da 's original charm . season one story line was more interesting , a light side to the life at jam pony while a focused serious plot with manticore chasing down the x-series . i was looking forward to new seasons , in fact i still am . i hope the fox guys and da production crew realize that a lot of ppl still wait for da to make a comeback . even after 2 yrs of it being cancelled , da can make it big if worked on properly , and i think a name like james cameron should take on this challenge .
one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravo.initially out of curiosity i decided to watch it.to be perfectly honest i was n't disappointed.the main character is beautiful and her body is shown off well.you would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole film ! my only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays melnik.christ its bad ! the prison guard hank is woeful too.all he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co-guard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end . the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions . this movie is well watching alone for the beautiful , talented and very sexy jennifer thomas
the film maybe goes a little far , but if you love the show it 's what you expect . it 's not a bad movie ; it 's actually pretty good . if you do n't like the show , do n't see the movie . it starts off a little slow maybe , but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny . there are even a few `` heart-wrenching '' scenes toward the end . after all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you . also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show 's existience . he 's got a pretty good point . we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives , so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv , too . if they were celebrities we would n't mind at all , we 'd eat it up . do we not like his guest doing this just because they 're poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a `` leave it to beaver '' world ?
i happened upon this film by accident , and really enjoyed . timothy busfield 's character is without redeeming qualities , and at one point , busfield and star meloni ogle women as they pass by ... meloni 's take on the parade is different from busfield 's . janel maloney is terrific ... she looks very much like tea leone , but the major difference here is that janel can actually act . some very nice things in this film and well worth your attention when it 's on cable .
sure it was well shot and made , very well shot and made ! but the story was just so weak . and the portrayal of lincoln was even weaker . not that henry fonda was n't good but the character he played was nothing but a loon . do you mean to tell me that lincoln was a wise cracking smart ass with no respect of the law or the court . i mean who the hell was he supposed to be ? cousin vinnie ? i mean come on , `` i 'll just call you jackass then '' ? ? ? ? i understand that ford was going for great funny hero guy but i did n't really like this guy at all . he cheats in sports , talks like a real sweet simpleton and does not seem to know were to sit in a courtroom . how am i supposed to take this seriously . the twist was even weaker . i mean come on ! that was just stupid . the whole story seemed like it was thought up by some 5 year old in his or her dreams . saying that i liked it enough , it was very entertaining and made me laugh at several occasions so i ca n't say it 's a bad film . in fact i must say that i must say it 's good enough , nothing that entertains me and makes me laugh can be bad but this vivid and silly story was just so ridiculous that i ca n't understand how anyone could consider it great . i have no idea how historically accurate this film was but if any of it was true i would really have to shake my head .
`` heartland '' is a wonderful depiction of what it was really like to live on the frontier . the hard work and individual strength that were needed to survive the hardships of the climate and the lack of medical care are blended with the camaraderie and the interdependence of the settlers . the drama was especially meaningful because the story is based on the diaries of real people whose descendants still live there . it was also nice to see the west inhabited by real people . no one was glamorous or looked as if they had just spent a session with the makeup or costume department . conchatta ferrell is just wonderful . she is an example of the strong , persevering people who came to wyoming in the early 20th century and let no hardship stand in their way of a new life in a new land .
i saw the film twice in the space of one week , both times the at a cinema in orpington , kent , uk . the place was packed both times and people had to be turned away . from the start of the film with henry winkler getting 'injured ' on the football field the whole audience was in uproar with laughter , laughter that lasted until the credits . for those who love american wrestling this film is a must , but be ready to see henry winkler as you have never seen him before . also look out for a very well known actor whose trademark wrestling move is a head-but ! if you get a chance watch this movie and it is family comedy entertainment at its best !
this is not `` so bad that it is good , '' it is purely good ! for those who do n't understand why , you have the intellect of a four year old ( in response to a certain comment ... ) anyways , killer tomatoes eat france is a parody of itself , a parody of you , and a parody of me . it is the single most genius text in cinematic history . i have it and the three prequels sitting on my dvd rack next to herzog and kurosawa . it embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard . i write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me , the likes of which we have never seen . it can only be taken in portions ... its sort of exploitive ... by now i 'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum . my comment ended a while ago . hopefully it works when i submit it now .
every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama . do n't expect an emotional story of guilt , retribution and despair from `` scarface '' . this is a tale of ferocious greed , corruption , and power . the darker side of the fabled `` american dream '' . anybody complaining about the `` cheesiness '' of this film is missing the point . the superficial characters , cheesy music , and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess . nothing in the lives of these characters really matter , not on any human level at least . in fact the film practically borderlines satire , ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of tony montana . this is n't brian depalma 's strongest directorial effort , it is occasionally excellent and well-handled ( particularly the memorable finale ) , but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled . thankfully , it is supported by a very strong script by oliver stone ( probably good therapy for him , considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time ) . the themes are consistent , with the focus primarily on the life of tony montana , and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power . the dialogue is also excellent , see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama . there are many stand-out lines , which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another . the cast help make it what it is as well , but this is really pacino 's film . one of his earlier less subtle performances ( something much more common from him nowadays ) , this is a world entirely separate from michael corleone and frank serpico . yet he is as watchable here as ever , in very entertaining ( and intentionally over-the-top ) form . it is hard to imagine another tony montana after seeing this film , in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever . pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing , but i 've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife . not an exceptional effort , but unfairly misjudged . the supporting players are very good too , particularly paul shenar as the suave alejandro sosa . powerful , occasionally humorous , sometimes shocking , and continually controversial . `` scarface '' is one of the films of the eighties ( whatever that might mean to you ) . an essential and accessible gangster flick , and a pop-culture landmark . 9/10
this movie was the best movie i have ever seen . being lds i highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of joseph smith . although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone . i saw this movie with my family and i can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart . this movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with . after i saw this movie , there was not a single dry eye in the entire room . everyone was touched by what they saw and i have not been the same since i have seen it . i highly recommend this movie for everyone .
beautiful film , pure cassavetes style . gena rowland gives a stunning performance of a declining actress , dealing with success , aging , loneliness ... and alcoholism . she tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts , embodied by the death spectre of a young girl . acceptance of oneself , of human condition , though its overall difficulties , is the real purpose of the film . the parallel between the theatrical sequences and the film itself are puzzling : it 's like if the stage became a way out for the heroin . if all american movies could only be that top-quality , dealing with human relations on an adult level , not trying to infantilize and standardize feelings ... one of the best dramas ever . 10/10 .
sure , it was cheesy and nonsensical and at times corny , but at least the filmmakers did n't try . while most tv movies border on the brink of mediocrity , this film actually has some redeeming qualities to it . the cinematography was pretty good for a tv film , and viggo mortensen displays shades of aragorn in a film about a man who played by his own rules . most of the flashback sequences were kind of cheesy , but the scene with the mountain lion was intense . i was kind of annoyed by jason priestly 's role in the film as a rebellious shock-jock , but then again , it 's a tv movie ! despite all of the good things , the soundtrack was atrocious . however , it was nice to see tucson , arizona prominently featured in the film .
for a movie with a plot like this i would normally smell `` tearjerker '' in the first ten minutes and turn it off , but this was very well made , with emotional subtleties , great acting , and some genuinely funny moments . it was also interesting to see a different culture - a vanishing one at that . my wife and i both dug it !
a meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around crater lake . as the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster . recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like lost skeleton of cadavra and alien trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like crater lake monster available for screening . it 's the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal . its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it . this is a real drive-in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as star wars changed the way we look at special effects . the monster , a mix of stop motion and a life size head , is a charmingly quaint little beast . the filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem . sure its clear that its all fake , but is n't movies about suspension of disbelief ? actually i think its about really cool monsters , which this has . i like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way . if you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look no farther . this would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films ( boggy creek etc . )
while it certainly was n't the best movie i 've ever seen , it was certainly worth the $ 8 ( which ca n't be said for many movies these days . ) this was a pleasant account of a true story , although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie , ( ie , billy sunday 's character was three or four people in the real story combined together . ) robert deniro was of course good , and cuba gooding , jr. , was also impressive .
i just recently watched this 1954 movie starring vincent price for the first time on turner classic movies . price portrays don gallico , a magician/inventor who is driven to murder when his boss steals several of his magical inventions ( and also his wife , portrayed in a brief role by the lovely eva gabor ) . even though price is a murderer , i actually found myself rooting for him , he is a sympathetic character who is driven mad by the greedy people around him who keep taking advantage of him . although this movie does n't have the `` horror '' factor of some of his more famous roles ( such as my favorite , `` house of wax '' ) it nonetheless has enough going for it to keep the viewers interest . this is a must for vincent price fans .
starlift is a pleasant and interesting throwback to those all star musical pictures that every studio was putting out during the world war ii years . when you 've got such stars as gary cooper , james cagney , doris day , gordon macrae , and randolph scott , etc. , in the film and with such people as the gershwin brothers , cole porter , jule styne and sammy cahn supplying the music , it 's an easy to take film . and the plot is n't even in the way . what plot there is involves two air force enlisted men , dick wesson and ron hagerthy , trying to meet warner brothers starlet janice rule using as a gimmick the fact that both come from youngstown , ohio and hagerthy 's father was rule 's dentist as well as half of the town 's . the scheme works too well as louella parsons is soon putting them as an item in her column . yes , louella 's in the film as well . she must have liked warner brothers or jack warner catered to her more than the other studio bosses because she also used this studio to publicize her hollywood hotel radio program back in the day . but the rest of the plot also touched on the real life efforts of ruth roman also playing herself to get her studio and others to do shows at the air force bases for the servicemen and women going to korea . some of the names i 've mentioned and others sing and perform in a show at travis air force base where a lot of this film was shot . one specialty number was shot for the talents of phil harris who sing/narrates a ballad look out stranger , i 'm a texas ranger aided and assisted by virginia gibson , frank lovejoy and gary cooper . yup , cooper looked like he was having a great old time kidding his image . this is the oldest of clichés when you say they do n't make them like this any more , but they really do n't because you do n't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract . that 's one thing about the demise of the old studio system we can mourn .
antonio margheriti 's `` danza macabra '' aka . `` castle of blood '' of 1964 is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of italian gothic horror , and after mario bava 's `` la maschera del demonio '' ( aka . `` black sunday '' ) of 1960 and roger corman 's `` pit and the pendulum '' of 1961 ( starring the great vincent price ) another must-see that earned the wonderful barbara steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female horror icon in the history of motion pictures . but not only is the beautiful and brilliant barbara steele one of my favorite actresses of all-time , the screenplay to `` danza macabra '' was co-written by no one less than the cinematic genius sergio corbucci , who directed such ingenious spaghetti western milestones as `` django '' ( 1966 ) and `` the great silence '' ( 1968 ) . italy 's number 2 in the field ( right after mario bava ) , director antonio margheriti is one of the all-time masters of gothic horror , and `` castle of blood '' is doubtlessly his greatest achievement . hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting , yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece . when he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories , edgar allen poe , in a gloomy london tavern , young journalist alan foster ( georges rivière ) accepts a bet from a nobleman , that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all souls ' eve . as soon as foster enters the eerie castle , mysterious things start to happen . after a little while , however , he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle , the stunningly beautiful elisabeth blackwood ( barbara steele ) . the mysterious events so far , however , have only been forebodings of the terrors the castle bears , however ... the eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood , the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by riz ortolani create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison . the wonderful barbara steele is fantastic as always , i simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress . no other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with steele , and no actress ever will . besides steele , the movie 's cast contains another stunning beauty , margarete robsahm , and she also delivers a great performance . george rivière 's performance as alan foster is great , and the rest of the performances are also very good . `` castle of blood '' is outstanding in many departments : barbara steele delivers one of her best performances , the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison , the atmosphere is incredibly eerie ... the film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere , gothic beauty and the art of terror . in short : `` castle of blood '' is one of the most atmospheric and greatest gothic horror films ever made , and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre ! 10/10
a famous orchestra conductor , daniel dareus , suffers what appears a heart attack as he finished conducting a concert . suddenly , we watch him as he arrives in the small town that he has left years before . since he left so young , and having his name changed contributes to give him a new persona . he has bought the old school building where he plans to stay . the building needs a lot of work . one would expect a man in his position to have all the comforts of the world he left behind to be installed in his new abode , but no , daniel puts up with the harsh winter in his own way . the local pastor , stig , whose church has a small choir , comes calling to see if he can interest daniel in helping , but the conductor has no desire to go back to music . daniel begins to explore his new universe . the town 's people leave him alone . he makes an impression on lena , who works in the local store where he goes to get his food supplies . little by little , he comes around and decides to involve himself with the choir . lena will ultimately fall in love with daniel . at first , the relationship between daniel and the choir members is not exactly what he expected . as they get to know him better , they come around to accept him and make him one of them . his new position does n't endear him to the woman who used to be in charge . the members of the choir are a motley crew , but they realize the change daniel has made in the way they interpret different songs . the new piece composed for gabriella , a battered wife , makes a great impact in her life and that of her fellow singers . daniel 's ideas for the repertoire clash with stig 's own . the vicar suddenly begins seeing daniel in a new light ; he is a tormented man who likes to read pornographic magazines before making love to his wife , siv . his ideas clash with the dogma , as siv points to him . stig decides to try to put a stop to what he considers an unhealthy influence of daniel by firing him as the head of the choir . the choir , which has been invited to participate in a competition travels to austria . daniel , who by now has fallen totally for lena , has a chance to show for the first time in his life his feelings for her when she starts to gets doubts about their relationship . daniel who is late for his own concert , gets to hear them making extraordinary music even though he is not in among them . kay pollak , the director of this enormously appealing film , shows he was the man to direct it . the story involves the viewer from the start . great part of the success of the movie goes to the ensemble cast that was put together . william nykvist , who plays the leading role is the best excuse for watching the film . frida hallgren , niklas falk , ylva loof , do excellent work for mr. pollak . stefan nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music one hears . harald gunnar paalgard 's cinematography makes the film look better capturing different seasons for the viewer in their beauty .
this movie is bufoonery ! and i loved it ! the `` dragon lord '' ( jacky chan ) and his buddy , `` cowboy '' , totally made the movie fun , meaningful , and just plain silly . the movie is a rare blend of a good vs. evil fight and ( somehow ) the wonders and fun that is growing up . long shao ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young `` dragon lord '' ( so named because he is the son of a wealthy family ) and `` cowboy '' , which include implementing clever , elaborate ways to escape studying ( with the help of the entire household , including the tutor ) , competing in rather boyish ( and idiotically interesting ) ways to gain the affection of a local girl , competing in `` soccer '' ( you will see what i mean ) and the list goes on . somehow they find themselves in the midst of a fight to save the a shipment of valuable antiques and the lives of several people . the movie has its serious moments . but they do not depress , but rather inspire . the playfulness of the boys are not lost in this exchange , but is actually employed against evil . what i really loved about this movie is how it ends . not the typical confrontation ( which in itself was awesome ) , but well , you 'll see . let me just say it truly captures the spirit of the movie . silly , witty , meaningful , and nostalgic . great movie .
i love jack 's jokes like 'the cliché is ... ' or `` over the top cliché guy , black , oily skin , kinda spooky ... '' . he is just hilarious ! daniel 's starting to catch up on him to ! good thing jack 's not on the team anymore ( in a way ) or else it would have been sarcasm mania ! ! ! ! i just love all the plots ( season 8 , a little less , i have to admit ) , the characters are great , the actors are great , i 'm starting to pick up facial expressions ( and more ) from jack , daniel and teal ' c ... it just all theoretically possible and exciting ... oops ! their i go again ! ! ! sorry , i 'm also starting to pick up traits from carter , and all of this is driving my parents nutz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! well , to conclude , i think it 's good for another three seasons or so , especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor , drama , action and so forth ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this is definitely one of jet 's best efforts . few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can . the action is rapid-fire , and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes . as a result , it may take americans a little off-guard . a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film . i feel that it is an excellent introduction to jet 's work and look forward to further masterpieces ( especially fist of legend ) making it into the us market . a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts .
this was one of the highlights of st : tng 's semi-forgettable second season , before they 'grew up ' or grew into their own in the third season and beyond . this was not only a showcase for up-and-comers like bill campbell and teri hatcher , but was also the continuation of data 's search for his 'humanity ' , this time through the concept of comedy . still one of my favorite episodes . on a side-note , i 'm still disappointed that there is no credit for the actress with whose character okona was about to have a tryst ( after teri hatcher 's character ) before being rudely interrupted by lt worf . i remember watching this episode 'first-run ' at my friends comic shop back in the day and we all thought she would 've been a perfect jean grey/marvel girl . it would be nice to know who this pretty lady actually is ...
claire denis has demonstrated repeatedly that film does not need to tell a story , that it is sufficient to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make of them what they will . ostensibly the idea within the framework of a most non-linear film is the older man living on the french-swiss border , a man devoted to his dogs , who still has a lover , but whose cardiac status increasingly threatens his life . he has a son with a little family who infrequently meet with him , but when he discovers he is in need of a heart transplant he opts for going to tahiti via japan to obtain a heart transplant on the black market and to rekindle a long lost relationship with a son he had form a tahitian women years ago . what denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul , the vastness of nature , man 's interaction with people vs animals , etc . much of the time the 'film ' does n't make sense , but that is because we try too hard to connect all the dots laid out before us in beautiful pictures . life is sort of like that : we look , see , observe , integrate , process , and make of it what we will . in using this form of film making ( much as she did in the strangely beautiful 'beau travail ' ) claire denis has developed a signature technique . whether or not the viewer finds the finished product rewarding has much to do with our individual methods of processing visual and conceptual information . this is an interesting and visually captivating film , but many viewers will find it an overly long discourse about very little . perhaps watching again will change that . grady harp
as if most people did n't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry , this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm . a successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man ( on their anniversary of all days ! ) and snaps big time into a furious breakdown . after shooting an attack dog 's head off , he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his `` slut '' of a wife . there are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing , tongue-cutting , and beauty queen fondling , as well as a marvelously deranged performance by corbin bernsen . the scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch . a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail . `` the dentist '' is incredibly entertaining , fast-paced , and laughably gory at times . check it out !
i decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site . i would have to say it was worth the effort . however , you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes . if you do n't have the staying power , get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights . now to the film , what i say will contain `` spoilers '' and if you do n't mind , here goes : alexandre is a promiscuous bum , a womanizer and a gigolo . he lives with an older woman called marie . marie owns a retail shop and she provides for alex . alex spends his days at cafés and restaurants . the story reveals that alex had previously impregnated gilberte whom he used to live with . gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because alex had abused and battered her . at this point , alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else . by chance , alexandre meets a nurse nymph called veronika and they striked up a relationship . veronika fell in love with alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past . marie and veronika struggles for alex 's affection and had a ménage à trois to boot . finally at the end , it 's revealed veronika is pregnant with alex 's child and alex asked her to marry him . we assume ( as aforesaid with gilberte 's situation ) alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family . there is hope ! with the title of `` la maman et la putain '' , i deduce jean eustache was relating to françoise lebrun 's character of veronika . she was a whore and then she became the mother . hence , the mother and whore is the same person ? anyway , what do i know ! french films are mostly ( not all ) very chatty , aimlessly political , preaching , theatrical , insipid , lamenting and full of quotes . lebrun and léaud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed . not a bad effort . 7/10 .
what a loss the passing of director emile ardolino was ! he could take a light script and , with the right casting and editing , put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star . this particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great romances go , but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end . you really want to know how things are going to work out . the script is perfect for cybill shepherd , who at the time needed to capitalize on her `` moonlighting '' success for the new generation who was ( fortunately for her ) probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start . in this film she 's every bit back in form as a still-pining widow living vicariously through her daughter ( mary stuart masterson on the cusp of stardom which would peak with `` fried green tomatoes '' two years later ) . she may have looked too young for the role , but that works well for the way the story unfolds . this is her film , but she does n't overstep her bounds as a lead . shepherd graciously allows robert downey jr. to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point . and there 's ample support from ryan o'neal ( in his best role in years ) and christopher macdonald . masterson 's natural charm pretty much coasts on its own , either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word . ardolino makes good use of his cast 's sex appeal the same way he did with `` dirty dancing '' , but this film is not quite as sizzling so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room . ( use your best judgment , they 're your parents after all . ) i give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly , romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime , and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well . again , credit goes to emile ardolino for making the most of a charming script by randy and perry howze . ( where are they now ? ) ardolino 's next film would be the phoned-in sequel to `` three men and a baby '' but his final theatrical release ( sister act ) would finally give him the nine-figure-grossing smash hit he deserved . mr. ardolino , your cinematic touch is missed !
i thought this move was very good . there were a few things that were less than perfect , but overall , i was quite surprised . the courtroom scene in the end seemed a little unrealistic , but was real enough to be entertaining . i found that the movie communicated the hardships of going though military training and the sacrifices that go along with it . being a military pilot i could relate to many of these parts .
i thought this movie was really really great ! helena did an amazing job in it ! i thought she played her character very well ! she 's an awesome actress ! ! : ) the movie was also really funny too ! the jokes were great ! i couldnt stop laughing ! : ) i think everyone should see it ... : )
this is a quirky little movie , and i have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well . it follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous las vegas illusionist , and is partly about following his dream , partly about the dreams of others , and all about the travails of showbiz . i thought the movie was charming , and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile . alan arkin is terrific as the magician who never was , and his mentoring of max makes for a funny and touching relationship . not for everyone , probably , but if you like movies about the journey , then i think you 'll like this one .
this is a great example of a good , dumb movie . no , it is not high art by any means . nor is the script anywhere close to a woody allen or mel brooks . but so what ! the killer tomatoes series ( four movies and a cartoon series ) are basically good-natured romps gleefully trampling on the kind of territory the zuckers ruled before they switched to making serious flicks . as the title suggests , this fourth installment of the killer tomatoes trilogy deals with the killer tomatoes plot against france . in this case , professor gangrene ( john astin 's 3rd time in the role ) has a plan to rule france through an ancient prophecy about the return of the rightful king of france . steve lundquist returns as igor , a humanoid tomato who wants to be a sportscaster and who just happens to be a dead ringer for the long-lost true king of france . obviously he also plays the aforementioned l-l t k of f , happily skewering the french language . opposing them is the fearless fuzzy tomato ( like the others , ft was introduced in the second film and would be a main character in the cartoon ) and his human allies . mark price , recently unemployed as a result of the conclusion of the family ties series , plays a thinly disguised version of himself , passing himself as `` michael j fox '' as a way to win the girl of his dreams . and angela visser is a dream as marie , gleefully bouncing between unabashed virginal sexuality and borderline psychosis . oh that the former miss netherlands had had more of a film career ! another returning member of the killer tomatoes stock company is rick rockwell ( now best known as the hapless title subject of `` who wants to marry a millionaire ? '' ) . like co-creator john de bello , rockwell works both in front of and behind the camera in this series . what can you say about jon de bello ? not much , really , except that he had a singular vision and managed to pull it off and , having done that , has apparently dropped into obscurity . john , if you ever see this , thanks for giving us the killer tomatoes . the script is heavily but not obnoxiously aware that this is just a movie . like return of the killer tomatoes , the action occasionally veers off the set and into the middle of the film crew . and mark price has a funny forum to complain about his own lack of success compared to his former costar michael j fox . this is the biggest budgeted of all the killer tomatoes flicks and is a nice send-off to the series . okay , the show then moved to fox kids as a cartoon series ( which was also quite clever ) , but cartoons just are n't the same .
this was a must see documentary for me when i missed the opportunity in 2004 , so i was definitely going to watch the repeat . i really sympathised with the main character of the film , because , this is true , i have a milder condition of the skin problem he had , dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ( eb ) . this is a sad , sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder . jonny kennedy speaks like a kid ( because of wasting vocal muscle ) and never went through puberty , but he is 36 years old . most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition , and pealing off his bandages . jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour , he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin . he tells his story with the help of his mother , edna kennedy , his older brother and celebrity model , and jonny 's supporter , nell mcandrew . it won the baftas for best editing and best new director ( factual ) , and it was nominated for best sound ( factual ) and the flaherty documentary award . it was number 10 on the 100 greatest tv treats 2004 . a must see documentary !
it 'd be easy to call guys and dolls great . it 's got frank sinatra and marlon brando ( and , contrary to sinatra 's original wishes , the casting works ) , it 's got a really cool 1950s feel , even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption . and most of the songs are often a lot of fun , and catchy , and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself . if it 's not entirely as great as some others of its ilk , it should n't be any fault of the filmmaker joseph l. mankiewicz . not all the songs entirely click , and a little of the dialog feels like it 's being performed for the stage as opposed to film ( it 's hard to tell at times- brando and sinatra straddle the line so often that one has to watch carefully to tell when one plays for the camera or for the `` stage '' , while the actress playing adele is better for stage than screen ) . the plot is one of those winners that works well for its period , even if one wonders if its influence has stretched to the likes of 1999 's she 's all that ( well , not quite , but close ) . a gambler ( and 14-year betrothed ) , played by sinatra , wants to host a big-time game , but is told that the `` heat is on '' , meaning the cops are on watch . so , he has only one choice to host the game , with a thousand dollar tab . the only way he can get it is through a big-time bet with fellow gambler brando , who 's put on to make a wild wooing job of a mission worker . it allows for the predictable twists in the story , in the sudden turn-on-turn-off of the charms of the character , of the idiosyncrasies of people from the streets ( gangsters and dancers and the `` saitn '' played by jean simmons who falls for brando ) . it is , in its basic concept , about this whole world of guys and dolls , and how to balance one or the other- obviously without getting married or too compromised . mankiewicz brings a lot of energy to the piece , even when keeping still with the camera on the subject , and his stars are properly reeled in . hell , even brando works excellently for a musical as he goes beyond being simply the method actor and shows his chops for singing and big-star quality . the story and characters eventually wind down to what you 'd hope will happen , and that 's fine . all we ask for- and what we get- is entertainment in good spurts of witty , involving dialog , and a few songs and dances that bring the house down ( my favorites were the number with the lady-cats at the club , luck be a lady , and the two numbers down in havana , cuba ) . a-
joe buck ( jon voight ) decides he 's going to leave his small life in texas and make it big in the big city . the women are there for the asking and the men are mainly `` tutti-fruttis . '' wide-eyed , he comes to new york city , not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences , one worse than the other . in the middle of that chaos , he meets and befriends rico `` ratso '' rizzo ( dustin hoffmann ) , a homeless-looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building . there is n't much of a story as midnight cowboy is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only joe buck 's plights in the city , but also inter-cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi-psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past : his failed relationship with his girlfriend annie ( jennifer salt ) who was gang-raped , his abandonment by his mother , and his apparent abuse by his grandmother , who also had a habit of hustling men for money . an air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery `` everybody 's talking ' '' ; we feel that even while we want joe to eventually make his mark in the city , the odds are high he wo n't and will end up working for pennies in a dead-end job -- shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself . we know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this . a dark story of dashed hopes , john schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s , and at the center , the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life . there is the implied notion that they may have been lovers -- ratso 's reaching out to hug joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this -- but this is essentially a buddy film , one that manages to survive , literally , to the death , and bring some form of hope to joe who at the end in florida seems much changed , older , wiser .
as i am no fan of almost any post- '' desperate living '' john waters films , i warmed to `` pecker '' . after he emerged from the underground , waters produced trash-lite versions of his earlier works ( `` cry baby '' , `` polyester '' , hairspray '' ) that to die-hard fans looked and tasted like watered down liqueur . `` pecker '' , which does n't attempt to regurgitate early successes , is a slight , quiet , humble commentary on the vagaries of celebrity and the pretentiousness of the art world . waters clearly knows this subject well because he has also exhibited and sold ( at ridiculous prices ) some of the most amateurish pop art ever created that you could n't imagine anyone being able to give away if it was n't emblazoned with the waters `` name '' . edward furlong is fine as `` pecker '' and waters ' non-histrionic style is at ease with the subject .
one of my favorite scenes is at the beginning when guests on a private yacht decide to take an impromptu swim - in their underwear ! rather risqué for 1931 !
i do n't know why some people criticise that show so much . it is a great , funny show - probably not the right material for mainstream prime-time , but still ... the family dynamics are funny , and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows . the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious . the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried & roy jibes are only just above average , but ever so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you roll on the floor laughing . this show was well worth the 8 pounds i paid for it . rating : 8/10
it was in 1988 , when i saw `` the ronnie and nancy show '' for the first time ( on austrian television ) . at that time , i was already a very big fan of spitting image ( since when it won the bronze rose of the montreux film festival in 1986 ) . of course i recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again - especially `` the ronnie and nancy show '' . i remember that scene when ronnie stood in front of a painting of abraham lincoln ( thinking it was a mirror ) and said to himself `` i need a shave '' . or most amusing of all , when he played ball with his dog - but vice-versa ! it 's such a shame , that spitting image seems to fall into oblivion ; it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent made tv-shows ever . compared to other satirical broadcasts it was definitely the best of all . well , almost 20 years have passed since then , and i wish i could see the show again . is it possible to purchase it from someone ... somewhere ?
this was a superb episode , one of the best of both seasons . down right horror for a change , with a story that is way way above the average moh episodes , if there is such a thing . a man 's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck , in which he was driving . his airbag worked , her 's did n't . she is burned beyond recognition ( great makeup btw ) , and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft . but , even in a coma , she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology , and when she does die for a few minutes , her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit . carnage of course ensues , and also some extremely gory killings , and also , some extremely sexy scenes . what more could you ask for , you might ask ? well , not much , because this baby has it all , and a very satirical ending , that should leave a smile on most viewers faces . i just loved rob schmidt 's ( wrong turn ) direction too , he has a great knack for horror . excellent episode , this is one i 'm buying for sure .
the first of the official ghibli films , laputa is most similar to its predecessor nausicaa , but whereas nausicaa was a sf epic , this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak sf premise . for the first half hour of the movie i thought i was going to love it . once again you find yourself in awe of miyazaki 's attention to detail , and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous , beautiful perfection . the animation , though still not in the league of the later ghibli films , is a little better than in nausicaa . i mentioned in my review of nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'lupinesque ' anime style . here there are a whole bunch of them : the pirates . they provide the comic element in the film , though quite why it needs a comic element i 'm not sure . there was nothing funny about nausicaa , and i think it was better off for it . still . having said that , dola , the pirate leader , is easily the most memorable character in the film ( even if she 's basically a female long john silver . do n't be surprised if you 're reminded of 'treasure planet ' at times ) and is well voiced by cloris leachman in the american dub . the english voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part , actually . however something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark . i think the best way that i could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story . i 'll come back to that later . there is so much to admire about laputa , and so many people obviously love it , that i almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10 , but for me the operative word here is 'admire ' . it was more impressive than personally affecting , and at over two hours it just started to drag . the crucial thing for me was this : i really found that i did n't care much about any of the characters . disney would have taken the care to develop the characters , make you really fall for them , rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie . even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard sf in the story to make up for it , but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about princesses and magic crystals . that 's where laputa falls down as far as i 'm concerned , and that 's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie . having said that , it must be admitted that miyazaki was leagues ahead of disney in general in 1986 , when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'great mouse detective ' . laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film , and you should definitely see it , but i do feel it 's over-rated . i definitely prefer the earlier 'nausicaa of the valley of the wind ' . btw , if you manage to watch them in chronological order , watch for the fox-squirrel from nausicaa popping up briefly in laputa .
cute film about three lively sisters from switzerland ( often seen running about in matching outfits ) who want to get their parents back together ( seems mom is still carrying the torch for dad ) - so they sail off to new york to stop the dad from marrying a blonde gold-digger he calls `` precious '' . dad has n't seen his daughters in ten years , they ( oddly enough ) do n't seem to mind and think he 's wonderful , and meanwhile precious seems to lead a life mainly run by her overbearing mother ( alice brady ) , a woman who just wants to see to it her daughter marries a rich man . the sisters get the idea of pushing precious into the path of a drunken hungarian count , tricking the two gold-digging women into thinking he is one of the richest men in europe . but a case of mistaken identity makes the girls think the count is good-looking ray milland , who goes along with the scheme 'cause he has a crush on sister kay . this film is enjoyable , light fare . barbara read as kay comes across as sweet and pretty , ray milland looks oh so young and handsome here ( though , unfortunately , is given little to do ) , alice brady is quite good as the scheming mother - but it is deanna durbin , a real charmer and cute as a button playing youngest sister penny , who pretty much steals the show . with absolutely beautiful vocals , she sings several songs throughout the film , though i actually would have liked to have seen them feature her even more in this . the plot in this film is a bit silly , but nevertheless , i found the film to be entertaining and fun .
pleasant story of the community of pimlico in london who , after an unexploded ww2 bomb explodes , find a royal charter stating that the area they live in forms part of burgundy . this movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to them . a solid cast of british stalwarts , especially stanley holloway , makes this more believable . there are some very nice moments in the film , such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them . even though you always knew pimlico would become part of the uk again , the people of pimlico and as a consequence the viewer does n't mind when this happens , leaving a nice happy feeling . it 's amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in london still remain so popular over fifty years later . the producers must have got something right .
i adored this movie . not only because i am a big fan of moritz bleibtreu , although he is in practically all german movies that count . but also because he is not the main actor . the lead is taken over by barnaby metschurat , who was the only reason to watch 2001 's julietta , and who really carries this movie on his shoulders . a family moves from italy to germany seeking `` the german dream '' ( this is my own invention and ironic ... ) of cheap labor in steel and coal industries . however , they end up opening a restaurant and the journey the movie takes to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming . from this point onward , the story told is mainly that of the two brothers of this family , giancarlo ( bleibtreu ) and gigi ( metschurat ) . gigi 's dream to become a filmmaker is threatened by rivalry with his brother and his mother 's determination to return to italy . what follows is a great - and totally neutral - look at what life can become formed by the choices you make . in the end , this movie does n't say which life ( gigi 's or giancarlo 's ) was more successful or fuller or more interesting . it merely gives us a rewarding glimpse at what it must be like to search for identity when two countries and mentalities are involved . and this look is not driven by bitterness or disdain to either country , which makes it such a great film for any and every country dealing with the tensions resulting from immigration . the fact that director fatih akin 's moved to germany from turkey in the 70s also lends this movie a large measure of its credibility and emotional accuracy . the icing on the cake are fantastic performances by the entire cast , especially metschurat and - this i really need to stress - the little boy who plays young gigi . that kid 's performance would be a hard act to follow by just about anyone ! great movie , go see it .
what a master piece . to take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future . this film is satire of the highest order . in my humble opinion it outranks dr. strangelove . the clever naming of the two superpowers , as the confederation and the market . cons being commies and market , the west ! outstanding . the clever use of gen joxs , was ahead of its time . only are we really seeing the dangers of genetic engineering . robot joxs tackled the issue head on in 1989 . the message of this film is about the comradeship of the humble man and how it can overcome the wishes of government . this movies screams do n't do it you fools you 'll kill us all . excellent 10/10
still the definitive program about the second world war , the world at war is n't just long , but also very informative . the series contains 26 episodes ( each episode lasts for about 45 min . ) , and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war . most episodes are about the war in europe , and there are several episodes about the war in the pacific . other episodes include information about the wars in africa , burma , the atlantic and the home fronts of germany , great britain , united states and soviet union . there is one episode that 's dedicated to the holocaust . the series starts off with the episode a new germany ( 1933-1939 ) , and tells about the rise of the nazis in germany and german territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war . the series ends with the episode remember ; the war 's influence in a post-war world . remember is a fitting episode to end this great program . every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits . the credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme . there are many fitting music pieces throughout the series . each episode is like a mini-film . the footage is fantastic , and so is the way it was put together . in addition , some of the footage is in color . the information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining . the series was produced by jeremy isaacs for thames television ( uk ) . commissioned in 1969 , it took four years to produce , such was the depth of its research . the series was narrated by laurence olivier ( one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century ) . the series interviewed leading members of the allied and axis campaigns , including eyewitness accounts by civilians , enlisted men , officers and politicians , amongst them albert speer , karl donitz , jimmy stewart , bill mauldin , curtis lemay , lord mountbatten , alger hiss , toshikazu kase , arthur harris , charles sweeney , paul tibbets , traudl junge and historian stephen ambrose . jeremy isaacs says in `` the making of the world at war '' that he sought to interview , not necessarily the surviving big names , but their aides and assistants . the most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed , according to isaacs , was heinrich himmler 's adjutant , karl wolff . the latter admitted to witnessing a large-scale execution in himmler 's presence . the world at war is often considered to be the definitive television history of the second world war . some consider it the finest example of the documentary form . in a list of the 100 greatest british television programmes drawn up by the british film institute in 2000 , voted for by industry professionals , the world at war ranked 19th . the program has everything that the viewer needs to know about the war . after watching a few episodes i liked the series so much that i tried to watch the remaining episodes one after the other . i 've seen some of them several times . there are two other great documentary series that i know of that may be of interest to the viewer . one is called the great war ( 1964 ) that 's about world war i . the other is called cold war ( 1998 ) that 's about the cold war obviously .
after 'aakrosh ' , this was the second film for govind nihalani as a director.till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india.this movie proved a point that a documentary can fulfil the requirements of a commercial film without diluting its essence . it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released . this movie contested against the big banners of the bollywood like'coolie ' , 'betaab ' , 'hero ' in 1983 . smithapatel , in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he drifted away or lost his composure she was there to remind him . she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and shrubs.at one time , she even gave up her love when the hero 's ruthlessness touched the roof top . there was another character in this movie , which was played by om puri contemporary , naseeruddin shah.he played as an inspector-turned-alcoholic character.the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who rubbed the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to forecast the hero 's ending . in his debut film , sadashiv amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the filmfare.the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to adjust to the system to an extent . the anger which left half handedly continued in govind nihalani 's other film `` drohkaal '' . even after two decades , this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew . each one played their part par excellence .
considering the lack of art with in african cinema ( or black american cinema ) . the idea offers a multidimensional look at a community assigned to hoods and dealers . but the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short . but it is the unstated assertion of independence from these themes that is most sticking . the genre is unique and not the typical expectation . it is almost this departure which first catches the eye , so watching it twice is critical . the film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinema . and it is this true art that with an african voice that is extremely rare . the film does n't copy to attain its message , it innovates and provokes by pulling at subtle stereotypes ( not racial but character based stereotypes ) , from a writers perspective the film is brilliant . it carries multiply messages which include a very rapid character development . it must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly . the usage of colour texture and music is also to be commended . but considering the director , owen alik shahadah 's last venture 500 years later , music is to be expected . but from a theme point-of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire eludes indirectly to a social problembrilliant stuff !
the dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies ; as is the equally dehumanising , but potentially life-saving , dehumanising effect of military training . joel schumacher 's 'tigerland ' follows the standard template , we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers , with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers , and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified ; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained ( typically , as here , vietnam ) . but 'tigerland ' has an interesting take , by centring its account on a cocky dissident named bozz ( played outstandingly well by colin farrell ) , who understands that all power governs ultimately by consent , and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity . around this character , a taught , gripping plot has been constructed , and it 's also a plus that the action never leaves america ( whereas stanley kubrick 's 'full metal jacket ' , to name just one other film of a similar type , lost focus once the action shifted to asia ) . although this is not a film of staggering originality , it 's supremely well done and captivating viewing throughout : the best film from this director that i 've seen , and among the very best of its genre .
a real classic . a shipload of sailors trying to get to the towns daughters while their fathers go to extremes to deter the sailors attempts . a maidens cry for aid results in the dispatch of the `` rape squad '' . a cult film waiting to happen !
there 's something about every `` hammer '' movie i see that really takes me into a new fantasy world . in the world of `` hammer '' movies , anything can happen . `` guardian of the abyss '' is one of those types of movies . it adventures deep into the occult and hypnosis to bring a different type of horror fantasy . all in all , an unforgettable movie . 7.5/10 .
this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival . but unlike `` yes '' , by sally potter , which i had seen some days before , where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive , this time quite the opposite thing happened : there was something that dragged me down , and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe . it was as if , all of a sudden , there was nothing left , all hope , all future had been taken away to a dead place . nina 's life seemed to be dismal and locked , but then , one lovely day , there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams . there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion , just out of nothing , someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life . that person was toni , a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots , just like herself . but the film 's title is `` ghosts '' , and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish , there is no way to retain them ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people , strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself , hiding away from all other people . françoise , a french woman , is a victim of such ghosts . she once lost her child daughter in berlin , who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket , in just one moment of inattentiveness . now time has passed , and françoise is back in berlin , still looking for the missing child . nina could be that child , after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity . and nina adopts that idea , after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion , she also longs for a mother . but in the end she is empty-handed , toni has disappeared with a man , and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman . `` marie is dead , '' concludes françoise 's husband , and the statement could not be more disillusioning . nina is just a `` niña '' , a girl without name , there is no hope for any divine fulfillment . there is no marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives . therefore , in the end , we see nina all alone , about to walk along the road that has opened up before her , into a future that seems joyless and uncertain .

`` margaritas and cock ... '' this tremendously entertaining film grabs you from the opening scene and never stops delivering laughs , surprises and unexpectedly touching moments . i had more fun watching `` the matador '' than almost any other film from 2005 . it is a wacky film with an unforgettable character , played to perfection by pierce brosnan . julian noble ( brosnan ) is a facilitator ( hit-man ) who specializes in high-end corporate gigs ( assassinating rich dudes ) . he is also experiencing something akin to a mid-life crisis . after coming to realization that he has no real friends , no permanent home and no planned future , he stumbles into a mexican hotel bar one night and runs into danny wright ( kinnear ) . danny is a down-on-his-luck family man who is on the verge of losing the big business deal that just might turn things around for him . he loves his wife dearly , especially so since they lost their young son a few years earlier . the two men are chalk and cheese , hardly any common ground other than that they are in the same desolate bar one night . and somehow a conversation is struck that sets in to motion a chain of events that will change their lives forever . the friendship they form reminded me a lot of laurel and hardy . one is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets them into trouble . the interplay is superbly timed and finely tuned , due in no small part to the wonderful performances from brosnan and kinnear . but make no mistake ... this is brosnan 's film . he imprints one of the most memorable and despicably likable characters of the decade . he could shoot your mother and apologize immediately thereafter and you 'd probably forgive him . brosnan may be cinema 's ultimate charmer , but this is his most endearing and complete performance to date . i would n't be averse to seeing an oscar nod for this role . consider one scene where he overtly ogles a high-school girl with the impurest of thoughts and utters the line , `` all blushy blushy ... no sucky fucky '' . he does it with the familiar bond smirk and manages to get away with it . he manages to tell a young boy , `` tell your mother to lose 30lbs and 20 years . then get back to me '' without coming across as unlikable . in fact , it makes us like him even more . and yet the film manages to surprise us with some truly touching scenes , most of which come toward the end when the film takes some unpredictable turns . however , when julian thumbs through his little black book to find someone to call on his birthday , or when danny and his wife ( davis ) console each other in their bedroom one night , the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion . `` the matador '' is stylish and energetic . it is constantly entertaining . and it contains a career-defining role for brosnan as the lonely hit-man looking for normalcy , friendship and a means to do at least one good thing in his life . this is an overlooked gem in 2005 and you should make an effort to see this film as soon as possible . tc candler of independentcritics.com
the third fred macmurray/carole lombard film is a bit more serious than hands across the table and the princess comes across . it 's yet another adaption of the play burlesque which apparently was popular back in the day . the original play burlesque ran on broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances and it 's the role that carole lombard plays that barbara stanwyck originated on broadway that brought her to hollywood . a version starred nancy carroll in the early days of talkies and later on betty grable and dan dailey did still another version of it in when my baby smiles at me . in fact i have a vinyl album of a radio version that al jolson and ruby keeler did for the lux radio theater . that 's an interesting work , believe me . anyway macmurray and lombard do fine by the old chestnut , the story is now set in a nightclub where lombard is a singer and macmurray is a jazz trumpeter . note a nice performance by dorothy lamour as the latin vixen who gets between fred and carole . also anthony quinn is in one of his earliest films as a wolf on the make for lombard . swing high , swing low holds up real nice today and i would n't be surprised if we see yet another version of burlesque for the twenty first century .
the wonderfully urbane ronald coleman is show-cased here as in few other of his films . he is literally in every scene and this comical movie remains fresh because of him , not in spite of him . he is handsome , witty and very clever here as he remains a step ahead of his wandering , lovely wife -- played perfectly by anna lee . the movie is based on a french play and brings all the best qualities of that farce . most of the supporting cast is well known , at least by face if not name ... and are absolutely perfect for this very funny film . the fantastic mr. coleman is a combination of sean connery and clark gable as he stays a step ahead of the other characters . his multi-talents can be further appreciated in the classic `` lost horizon '' which every film buff must see .
both visually and musically stunning . a treat for both the eye and the ear . the quintessential victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting , helping to create a christmas scene of which dickens himself would have been justifiably proud . technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting . the dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good . the photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed . a great film for all the family at christmas time and a most delightful discovery which will withstand multiple viewing .
`` happenstance '' is the most new york-feeling parisian film i 've seen since `` when the cat 's away ( chacun cherche son chat ) . `` a film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention audrey tatou is getting for `` amelie , '' its french title is more apt : `` le battement d'ailes du papillon ( the beating of the butterfly 's wings ) '' as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives . tatou 's gamine-ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures , and because she 's part of a large , multi-ethnic ensemble , so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters , especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me , and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that i was n't sure if they were doing that or not . but i loved how urban the coincidences were , from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around cafés . the subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once .

those who love elivra as i did in her late night movie hostess duties will love this movie - she is just plain cool - her car is great , and she is a bit of a transylvanian dolly parton - she is so innocent and naive at times - and sexy all of the time - plus , more than a touch of mae west - the sets are well done as well , and the comic cast is great , with edie mcclurg at her usual best - plus sally kellerman as patty is hilarious . any time i have to crunch something for a topping , i will think of how elvira crunches the potato chips - this movie is one to be watched again and again - just for the fun of it . now i have to get the sequel to it , elvira 's haunted hills , and see if it lives up to this one -- --
this showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4.5 ; i gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars . after reading the viewer comments , i was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy . yeah , i see that imdb lists it as comedy/drama under genre . that sure is misleading , is n't it ? fortunately , i saw the movie before logging onto this website so i did not have that expectation . in fact , based on the synopsis of what i heard , i fully expected it to simply be a drama . i 'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes . another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much 'character-driven ' . 'driving miss daisy ' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind . someone 's previous comment complained about a boring trial . tom 's ( danny glover ) work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie . that is , how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops , if you will . however , they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to greenwich and move 'up ' in the world . tom 's obsession became a compulsion . he proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood . his chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color . it was because of everything the 'interloper ' represented ; everything that tom had left behind . in essence , tom had become an oreo cookie : black on the outside but white on the inside . the last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written , directed and acted ( by whoopi goldberg ) i have ever had the pleasure to witness . i realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door ( do n't want to give it away ) . the climax is verbal and whoopi delivers it . i am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs tom which college tom -two is going to or when she releases it , all in the middle of the night and tom wakes up . nevertheless , the denouement is great . you know that life on that street will never be the same . my favorite kind of character-driven flick : people go through problems , some pain , do their dance , they grow , they change , and life goes on . as an audience member , i may learn something or be inspired .
`` girlfight '' is much more of a coming-of-age-story than it is a fight flick . and what a relief to have one in an urban school , with naturalistic , realistic latinos and believable use of brooklyn project settings . it made me realize that virtually all hollywood high school movies are set in luxurious suburbia or small towns . ( even the somewhat comparable `` love and basketball '' which focused on teen african-americans was set in suburbia . ) while these kids share some of the same peer problems , those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids , where high school graduation could be the major accomplishment of their lives . the feminist element here is riveting in its originality , as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship -- and a victory -- on her terms . a lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise to a gender-bending-expectations situation . the movie does drag a bit here and there , but this is no cheap thrills `` rocky '' fight movie , as the practices and fights have complex outcomes , and all the relationships -- especially with fathers and father-figures -- take more center stage than the center ring . there were lots of interesting music credits listed at the end , but i had n't really noticed the songs .

'holes ' was a great movie . disney made the right choice . every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it . everyone casted was fit for the part they had , and shia labeouf really has a future with acting . sigourney weaver was perfect for the warden , she was exactly how i imagined her . everyone who has n't seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will 'dig it ' .
easily one of the ten best movies of the 20th century . in cold blood is brilliant in the simplicity and realism of its storytelling , and absolutely riveting . robert blake walks away with the film . the story seems to be presented almost entirely from perry 's viewpoint , despite dick being the leader and planner of the pair . the viewer will invariable perceive dick as being more unstable , immature , and generally feel like perry would not have been pulled into this nightmare but for dick and his need to be somebody and pull off a big score . based on a true story with particular attention to accuracy , in cold blood depicts the story behind the brutal and senseless murder of a rural kansas family one cold , windy night , because dick has bought into an age-old rural myth about prosperous farmers having a safe full of cash in their home . as `` prosecutor '' ( a character that is n't given a name in the script ) , played by will geer , so astutely points out , their lives are bought for only $ 10 a head . director richard brooks wisely chooses not to share with us the gruesome details of the murders until the end of the film , prior to this we only know it has happened and watch the lives of dick and perry slowly unravel as they attempt to escape not only being apprehended by law enforcement , but also perry 's own ever-escalating sense of impending doom . he repeatedly makes remarks , `` no one ever gets away with a thing like that , '' and `` i ca n't help thinking we left something behind that belongs to us . '' dick is neither mature nor moral enough to feel any compelling sense of guilt over their crime , only irritation at perry 's . indeed , after they are caught , it is dick who breaks first , and suddenly faints when finally confronted with irrefutable proof that places the two men at the scene of the crime . i felt somewhat sorry for perry from the very beginning of the film , and more-so as events progressed , but i only loathed dick . the genius of the film is the engaging manner in which the story is played . we do not for a moment think we are watching actors portray characters , but that we are watching the actual participants and events as they occurred . the story is unrelenting , taunt , the run time slightly in excess of two hours feels more like just a few minutes . for those of you who are interested in such things , i noticed a couple of the `` goofs '' listed here on the imdb page for in cold blood are incorrect or exaggerated . such as the `` reversed '' process shot , at the beginning of the film , as dick and perry are driving across the bridge into kansas . to begin with , this is n't even a process shot , the camera is actually positioned in the backseat and the image you see beyond the windshield of the car is real . a large cargo truck located to the left front of dick 's pontiac creates the optical illusion that they are going backward because it is traveling at a greater rate of speed , but closer examination will reveal that they are indeed going forward and it is an actual shot filmed from a moving vehicle . as i previously stated , this is one of the ten best works of 20th century cinema , not recommended for the very young due to some course language and implied and inferred violence ( no actual in your face gore as a modern film would resort to ) , but a thoroughly excellent film .
a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy . director-writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock-imitation ( many called it a `` ripoff '' ) with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work ( and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-tv tapes ) . the downside of the movie , at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard , is the general sleaziness of all the characters , including the policeman played by a pre-nypd dennis franz ( who has hair here ! ) . the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit , even 25 years after its release . the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson ( if that is really her on the closeups ) and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies . there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder . the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it 's apparent who the killer is , it 's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through , particularly for males ogling the naked women .
shamefully , before i saw this film , i was unfamiliar with helena bonham carter . i had to do some research , in order to assure myself she was n't actually afflicted , as was her character , with ( well ? ) , what she was afflicted with . i was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady . she pulled it of flawlessly . who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final wants , and needs , of a unique young lady , could be interpreted as tender , and romantic ? well , they can be , when the right performers present them in the proper manner , as they did in this wonderful movie . i forgot to mention how dynamically beautiful miss carter looked in this movie . i have often said she was the most beautiful creature to have ever graced the face of our earth , but she seemed to have out done herself in this particular movie . i hope any of you who watch this movie enjoy it as much as i did . thank you for letting me express my opinion .
dominion tank police is without a shell of a doubt , one of the most amazing shows ever produced , but not just in the field of animation . while the first part ( acts 1 and 2 ) mostly consists of action and fun , the second part is more serious and one should not treat the second part in the exact same way as first part . the subtleties are truly out of this world and the characterization is beyond brilliant . you must have an extra degree of intelligence to appreciate the intricacies of the second part ( acts-3 and 4 ) . i do have some complaints though . in the first part , the tank bonaparte quite literally jumps over a tank shell and it did not make any sense at all . one might also question the plausibility of bonaparte jumping on the wing of helicopter gunship even though it was cool . buaku rules .
a beautiful new print of `` zabriskie point '' is playing in paris and seems to be doing well in the latin quarter . it 's time for a full evaluation of the film . let 's hope that the new print means that a dvd with some insightful `` extras '' will be out in the near future . i remember watching zp when it came out and thought it was a crashing bore . this time around i was totally awed and would classify it as a `` near-miss '' masterpiece . the first part of the movie is a time capsule of late '60 's los angeles , i lived there then , and antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place . kudos to production designer dean tavoularis who found some incredible locations and did outstanding work . the print i saw runs 1 hour 50 minutes . it is forbidden to those under 16 ( or 18 , i ca n't remember ) . i suspect there is quite a bit of restored footage in this print . spoiler -- i wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut . what appears today seems rather tame by current standards . there is no soundtrack music until almost 1 hour into the film . before we hear extraneous noise such as radio broadcasts , etc . antonioni was very daring to do this . i remember how much was made at the time of the lack of acting skills of non-actors mark frechette and daria halprin . this time frechette did not bother me . halprin is weaker but gradually improves as the film continues . much of the student riot footage looks like stock footage to me . one shot is in a different aspect ratio & distorted by the wide screen . of course , there is actual staged footage , but not all that much . i 'm still trying to figure out how antonioni did some of the shots of frechette flying the plane . it looks like he really did some of the flying - there 's no blue screen or double in some shots . i hope to get back to see the film a second time . recommended highly to all antonioni fans .
sure , he became rapidly uneven after this film , but from `` knife in the water '' up till `` the tenant '' , roman polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique . despite many running themes ( alienation , paranoia ) , no two of his films are really alike . the story of this is somewhat similar to his own `` repulsion '' from ten years earlier , but the tone is completely different . `` the tenant '' manages to balance darker than dark absurdity ( i 'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor , even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny ) with some truly suspenseful paranoia . polanski was always a master at building unease , and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy . the overall weirdness of the film is also a plus . in addition to polanski 's exquisite as usual direction , the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions . polanski the actor is often overshadowed by polanski the director , but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast . the themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange . the rest of the cast offers strong performances also , especially isabelle adjani 's sympathetic turn , and melyvn douglas and shelley winters ' appropriately annoying ones . `` the tenant '' is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both `` repulsion '' and `` rosemary 's baby '' , but its just as brilliant as either of those classics . ( 9/10 )
`` xizao '' , is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions , and its effects on a family in china . da ming ( quanxiu pu ) , is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother er ming ( wu jiang ) makes him believe that his father liu ( xu zhu ) , has died . he founds that his father is still alive , as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business , the public bathroom . the movie centers around da ming 's family , and how he has to learn the importance of his father 's job , something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon . also , the movie explores his relationship with er ming , who is mentally challenged , and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies , but also their souls . the two main themes of the movie , the family and the problems of progress , are incredibly well handled , and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make , both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of chinese society and customs . the director , yang zhang , tells his tale in a simple way , letting the characters characters do the job . it is a very simple approach , but it fits the movie perfectly , and i highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good . zhang has enormous potential , as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks . the acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach , everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed . the three lead characters give remarkable performances , and wu jiang as er ming surely steals the show . even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing `` old days were much better '' message , instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium , like saying that progress is good , and we must move on , but we must not forget where we came from , and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old . an awesome , and touching film . 8/10
the creators of south park in their own film here , this is a brilliant film with a huge entertainment factor . if you like naked gun films and are not young and not too mature or serious on your humor , you 'll love this .
even if you know absolutely nothing about ireland , you have to love `` my left foot '' ( and especially daniel day-lewis ' performance in it ) . he plays cerebral palsy-afflicted christy brown . due to this , he has spent most of his life ostracized . even when trying to warn people about something , they just laugh at him . the light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part : his left foot . he uses that appendage to paint and write poetry , bringing him to prominence . daniel day-lewis and director jim sheridan did very well on this collaboration , and also on a later collaboration : `` in the name of the father '' ( but `` the boxer '' was unnecessary ) . `` my left foot '' can make you feel many ways : sad , hopeful , or something else . but in any case , daniel day-lewis gave the performance of a lifetime here . a great movie in every sense .
this is one of my favorite films of all time . al pacino acting is at its best and the story is excellent . too bad it did n't do to well in the 80 's when it was first released because people did n't get a chance to experience this classic .
james stewart and margaret sullavan play co-workers in a budapest gift shop who do n't really like each other , not knowing they 're really sweetheart pen pals who have yet to meet . a very charming romantic comedy , very engagingly played by it 's two likable stars and a very eager-to-please supporting cast . the story is well written and the film has that romantic innocence ( do n't quite know how to explain it ) that films today just do n't have . this can obviously be compared to the recent you 've got mail , and the original wins in every way . this is mandatory viewing each christmas , i ca n't think of a better way to jumpstart a christmas feel than this little gem .
i just watched i. q. again tonight and had forgotten how much i love this movie . it is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world . i love the allusions to mozart all throughout from the opening with `` einstein '' playing `` twinkle , twinkle little star '' on the violin to him humming eine kleine nachtmusik during the iq testing of the ed walters . i love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career , an especially unique situation for the 1950 's , the time in which this movie is set . ( i myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children , so please do n't think i am some staunch women 's libber . ) it 's wonderful how a man who is `` only a grease monkey '' is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as catherine 's fiance , a clinical behavioral researcher . the message to me is that we are not what we do , but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels . there are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you do n't watch and listen carefully . i did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page . in the scene when ed walters is to speak at symposium , there are 3 instruments ( protractor , ruler , etc . ) hanging on the right from the chalk ledge . in the next camera shot , there only 2 . in the credits on our video , it lists tony shaloub 's character as bob watters , not bob rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on imdb . i highly recommend this movie . it may be a piece of fluff in some estimations , but has lots more substance than many give it credit for . not only that , what a great cast is assembled here . watch it and enjoy !
robin williams and kurt russell play guys in their 30 's who put their marraiges in jeopardy by deciding ( russell somewhat reluctantly ) to replay their heartbreaking tie with rival bakersfield years after the fact . williams is ok , but russell is flat-out great as legendary taft quarterback remo hightower . holly palance does a nice and attractive turn as williams ' wife , who could live without this rematch . film is worth watching just to see the famed remo in action . highly recommended .
perhaps it 's me and my perverted ways , or the fact that i tend to have a very sick mind , but i rented this film at random one very weird night and to my great surprise , i enjoyed it . yes , i read the synopsis on the back of the dvd box and read that it had been banned for 25 years and figured i was prepared for anything it would offer . i was clearly deceived after seeing ... well ... everything , to cut a long story short . i can see why it was banned , not only for such explicit sex scenes , but for beastiality . of course , as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of beauty and the beast , a personal favorite of mine , it tells the story of a girl 's sexual awakening over a dream about a duchess being chased by a whatever-the-hell-that-thing-was-like beast with an enormous erection and a substantial amount of ejaculation . of course , the beast gets what he wants and the duchess decides she likes it and they continue frolicking in the woods . but that 's not all . oh , there is so much more ! not only do we get to see interspecial sex , but there 's also humping horses , the babysitter who gets down and dirty with the slave when she 's not humping the bed to get her ... er ... satisfaction and the daydreaming girl masturbating with rose petals . creative and enjoyable , but it did take a while for my father to talk to me again after he watched it after i went to bed ... i was 15 . words of advice when watching this film : make sure you 're the only one who knows you have it and watch it with the curtains closed . it may be fun , but i doubt there are other porn films like this one .
... it even beats the nasty `` raw '' . almost twenty years old is this show and still i laughed very much when i was watching it last night . it shows eddie murphy dressed in tight red clothes ( old school ) and he jokes with everything from celebertis to his family . he was only 22-years old then and this is a must-see ! 8/10
finally , the uncut version of `` baby face '' surfaces and from what source ? the library of congress . the restored four minutes , snippets here and there , make for a much better film . we now know that baby face was pimped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years of age . another reason d'tat for her behavior and cold , calculating exterior . barbara stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of lily powers ( notice the moniker ) , a part that called for just the right amount of sexuality coated with power , cunning , and revenge , yet tinged with virginal pretense when called for , a very difficult portrayal to make convincing . barbara stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top ( literally ) , she still has good in her heart -- note the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as chico ( the marvelous actress theresa harris ) and the old philosopher . and though she exploits her sexuality to make mush of men who are rich and powerful , those same men are attempting to exploit her for their carnal desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her . lily powers fails to understand , at first , that emotions are difficult to ride , that it 's easy to lose control . one possible result is death . hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral , and it 's a cold lonely location . a word should be said about the philosophy of friedrich nietzsche whose will to power is stressed in `` baby face '' by the elderly philosopher who befriends lilly when she is still turning tricks for her old man . `` baby face '' was released the same year adolf hitler came to power in germany . though it 's highly unlikely that the semi-literate hitler understood much about nietzsche , he considered himself a nietzschean to the nth degree and touted it along side his other rantings . `` baby face '' serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of nietzsche 's will to power concept , especially in the final scenes . although `` you 've got the cutest little baby face . '' is apropos as a theme for `` baby face , '' an even more telling and applicable melody is w. c. handy 's `` st. louis blues '' played throughout the film , especially at times when the camera has to drift away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes . `` st. louis blues '' is also used wisely toward the end as lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values . chico is singing a raw , salacious version of `` st. louis blues '' when lily , now disagreeing with the lyrics , orders her to stop . the restored version of `` baby face '' makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new hollywood release . by all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy .
`` hatred of a minute '' is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years . not to say that it 's a brilliant film by any means , but it 's definitely worth a watch . `` hatred '' chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver ( played by director kallio ) , a formerly abused child now grown up , and starting to listen to his evil side . `` hatred '' is very nice visually . the shots are creative , and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at . this film actually has an element of production value to it , unlike other recent michigan releases like `` dark tomorrow '' and `` biker zombies . '' subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film 's $ 350,000 budget . however , `` hatred '' stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do , and that 's in the story and character department . essentially , things just kind-of happen . eric seaver does n't evolve at all . basically , he 's always been crazy , it 's just that people are starting to notice . the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development . also , the ending is very abrupt . however- since this is a horror film , since when do we care about plot ? we just want to see people die , and `` hatred '' certainly delivers . as the body count mounted , people in the theater started cheering `` kill her ! kill em ' all ! '' when people scream back at the screen , it 's always fun . that 's the place where `` hatred '' succeeds . it 's fun . and in the end , that 's all that really matters .
i was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time . the frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension , especially when landing , yet the specially effects when the krell attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago ! living in the middle east i saw shades of islam creep in when jj adams suggested alta should dress more modestly , and as an engineer , was amazed by the imagination used for the 'futuristic ' gadgets , and gizmos dreamed up by the props department . all in all , an entertaining hour and a half , my first time seeing walter pidgeon and a chance to see leslie neilsen as a 'young ' man
this is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie . there are many plots and turns . the story or the director opens question marks on the death row or presumed crimes committed by black people . this film is very well directed by arne glimcher and the fine sound of james newton howard is excellent . strong performance of sean connery and ed harris . if you liked this one don´t miss `` true crimes '' or `` the hurricane '' . my wife and me gave 8/10 .
one of the less widely lauded of recent asian period action affairs gojoe is an at first slow and often curious but overall pretty terrific offering , exciting , layered and beautiful . i 'm sad to say i know virtually nothing of the buddhist philosophy or japanese history and legend that surrounds this film so its deeper meanings are lost on me , but even without contextual knowledge this is still rich fare , taking a traditional fantasy structure into a , impactful higher plane . the story is of benkei , a warrior monk and perhaps demon who seeks enlightenment by destroying the demon of gojoe bridge : prince shanao , himself a mortal seeker after his own higher plane but this time the power of demons . thus the film becomes a matter of illusions and in benkei 's case , indecision , a conflict in which the real goal is self knowledge , for benkei to come to terms with his true nature and for prince shanao to come face to face with the nature of what he seeks to become . benkei is even more hampered here by the fact that his dark nature makes him fundamentally at odds with the world , even when not in open conflict he is never at ease . director sogo ishii handles this one as an epic , with measured pace , camera work always stylish and often frenzied , without neglecting the need for more sedate moments to let the location sink in , there is also great use of lighting and fog to give an ethereal atmosphere , there is an air of fantasy to much of the film but outside of the overtly supernatural moments it is a down and dirty fantasy with more period fell than flights of fancy . the cinematography of makoto watanbe is important here , vivid and detailed , a richly evocative affair . actingwise daisuke ryu is dignified and powerful with a mysterious savagery as benkei , while tadanobu asano has a driven , cold arrogance as prince shanao . of the leads masatoshi nagase rounds things out as an ordinary man , smart and cynical but still unaware of just exactly what the stakes are . the film all fits together well , it is however a touch flabby at times , it begins slowly , some shots are a little drawn out and the epic fight scenes at times go on longer than strictly necessary . as for the fighting it is filmed frenetic rather than for actual moves , it has artistic impact but may disappoint regular action fans , often obscured by objects , flashing blades and fast moving individuals , whirling with deadly force through their adversaries are the order of the day , it is invigorating to watch but in the end i could have done with a little more traditionalism . there is some unfortunate cgi bloodshed as well , it somewhat works in the context but is still distracting . overall though i found this to be a pretty great film , its not one for regular action fans or swordplay enthusiasts seeking another azumi , rather a deeper and more mystical beast , its ending in particular will not go down well with fans of the more generic wing of such fare . but as for myself it really hit the spot and for those more adventurously inclined it might do so too . well recommended at any rate .
a beautiful piece of children 's cinema buried in a world of archaic celticism . setting the story around the famous book of kels , believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of iona , off the western coast of scotland . telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of crom-cruic , the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology . in hopes of recovering a lost artefact . the films true beauty lies in its ' animation . cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity . deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant cartoon network series 'samurai jack ' for its genius use of mark making and background depth , the secret of kels creates a consistently affective celtic world living under the shadow of viking invasion . the history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and celtic-revivalist mysticism . the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is , as she glides from branch to branch . appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary cheshire cat from alice and wonderland . the secret of kels is an absolute treat . for all genders , all ages , it 's a lovely piece of family cinema . do n't expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed !
full house came to me when i was about 9 . i remember seeing re-runs of america 's funniest home videos with bob saget , and one day my mom told me that he was also in a show called full house . one day , i was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting family . it did n't seem too interesting at first , but as i watched more and more , ever night at 9:00 , i would just be so into it . this show really makes you want to be there yourself , hang out with the girls , go places with them , and maybe even join in their little family `` sing-alongs '' . the thing i like most about full house is that it 's a great show for kids and adults of all ages . there will be some parts that are more for adults , then parts that are meant for kids , so that the whole family will enjoy it . no matter how cheesy it can be , it 's still a great show , and i would definitely recommend it to anyone . 10/10
this is a great example of a rather simple film noir story that is handled exceptionally well -- thanks to excellent direction by otto preminger as well as some lovely acting performances . dana andrews stars as a hot-headed detective who all too often uses his fists instead of his brains . soon after the film begins , andrews is being reprimanded for this and is warned that if this continues he 'll be off the force . a bit later , while investigating a crime he 's attacked by a suspect and andrews is forced to fight to protect himself . this time he does not use excessive force but the assailant is killed . andrews panics and assumes they wo n't believe him so he tries to cover up the death -- though instead an innocent man is ultimately blamed for the crime . there 's a lot more to the film than this -- including a plot involving a slimy villain ( gary merrill ) and a love interest for andrews ( gene tierney ) . all in all , this is one of the better examples of the genre -- with great gritty dialog , superb lighting and a simple yet very effective story . this is the way noir was meant to be .
paul greengrass definitely saved the best bourne for last ! i 've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie , and some have even compared the camera style to the blair witch project . all i have to say to that is ... are you kidding me ? come on it was not that bad at all . i think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic , which i would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography . as for the rest of the movie i really did n't even notice it . you can tell that damon has really gotten comfortable with the role of jason bourne . sometimes that can be a bad thing , but in this case its a really good thing . he really becomes jason bourne in this installment . damon also has a great supporting cast in joan allen , ezra kramer , and julia stiles . david strathairn was a great addition to the cast , as he added more depth to the secret cia organization . even though the movie is filled with great car chases and nonstop action , they managed to stick a fair amount of character development in their with all of that going on . this film stands far above the other two bourne movies , and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 summer season !
`` fido '' is to be commended for taking a tired genre , zombies , and turning it into a most original film experience . the early 50s atmosphere is stunning , the acting terrific , and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning . suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars , `` eisenhower era '' dress , art deco furniture , and zombie servants . it would be very easy to dismiss `` fido '' as cartoon-like fluff , similar to `` tank girl '' , but the two movies are vastly different . `` fido has structure , a script that tells a story , and acting that is superior . make no mistake , this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed . highly recommended . - merk
i gave it an 8 star rating . the story may have fallen short about 3/4 of the way into the picture but the performances remained strong throughout . `` men of honor '' was changed from `` navy diver '' understandably so . anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that `` honor '' is an appropriate word to use in the title .
jackie chan is considered by many film and martial arts movie fans as one of the greatest action stars ever to grace the silver screen and police story cemented his reputation as the likely successor to the late , great bruce lee . if enter the dragon bared the so-called bench mark of lee 's greatness in the 70s , then the same can be said about police story and jackie chan in the 80s . forget about the rush hour trilogy , or any of his us efforts- the one film that really typifies chan 's excellence , not to mention kick starting his status as a high kicking , bone-crushing kung- fu talisman , as well as his movie career was this , police story- the first in a series of successful cop films , set in mainland , present day hong kong . i 've seen many of his efforts- likewise the us-based rush hour , rumble in the bronx , the medalian and the tuxedo to name- and frankly many of them pale into insignificance compared to police story . in those movies , we saw a less 'dumbed down ' version of jackie , of whom did n't get the opportunity to utilise his fighting abilities to the maximum , not to mention the fight sequences were no where as good as those in such efforts as drunken master , police story to name . the stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best featured in any action movie . the shopping mall scene is literally one of a kind and has to be seen to be believed : the flying shards of glass , chan who is left dangling outside the bus only by his walking stick as a madman frantically drives through the streets of the town , and chan successfully making usage of all sorts of inanimate objects and prop devices as weapons to fight the bad guys with . considering he is known for injuring and breaking every bone in his body and putting himself in harm 's way , jackie 's persistence in showing his versatility as a stuntman himself by not relying on one , is somewhat of a testament to his reputation as a kung fu expert . especially as he has the bruises to show for it . thus , he has proved that he is no one-trick pony when it comes down to devising and coming up with various and clever looking moves . story-wise , there is not much to discuss but what it lacks in narrative , it makes up with its end-to end action and fight sequences . as for the dialogue , well it 's not a really huge aspect of the film- which is why most fans of jackie 's and martial arts films are more interested in action , as opposed to the story . unlike say the matrix , there are no wires or cgi , or any form of computer trickery involved . what you see is what you get- and what you get with police story is a great jackie chan epic , full of action and pulsating stunts.it is miles better than rumble in the bronx , rush hour and all his other american efforts . police story is an excellent film and one i 'd definitely recommend to anyone who is a novice jackie chan fan , but of whom are unsure which one they should watch first .
a very cute movie with a great background provided by the city of boston and fenway park . as a baseball fan and light movie addict , it hit a homerun for me . plenty of laughs and plenty of authentic baseball scenes with real ballplayers and real references to past bosox failures . and how enjoyable was it to watch a movie with a baseball theme without having to endure an overage , over-the-hill , self-serving kevin costner attempting to make believers out of a critical audience ? jimmy and drew did a fine job as a young love-struck couple suffering from jimmy 's bosox `` jones '' . it was a bit whacky and out of left field , but there really are sox fans that are that fanatic and live their lives through the fortunes of their beloved team . the movie coasted along at a fast pace and the ending , although predictable , had the charm and sentimentality of so many other popular movies , without being overly pretentious . also enjoyable was the return of willie garson to the screen . i miss the forever-popular `` stanford blatch '' from sex & the city . he 's always funny , even when he does or says very little . so buy yourself two box seats , some popcorn , and get ready for a fun time . `` fever pitch '' is a winner .
the united states was still fighting world war ii ( the movie was released in between ve day and vj day ) . any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where fearless american soldiers beat the enemy , or americans in general were singing and dancing . technicolor musicals were what america thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed . most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number ! i get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970 . depressing how quickly we forget . this film could 've been called `` the search for jose iturbi '' but now everyone wonders why . allow me to explain . from 1929 -- his arrival in america -- until his death in 1980 , iturbi was one of the finest pianists to grace a concert stage . he agreed to do a few movies in 1942 , but hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time . not only an excellent pianist , but a successful conductor as well , iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years . the scene where iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of liszt 's rhapsodies was planned early on -- and has n't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children ? joe pasternak , who produced that movie & many other mgm musicals , credited iturbi with interesting america 's youth in classical music . grayson 's wanting an audition with iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time . everyone wanted iturbi back then . the joke among soldiers was that `` gi '' meant `` get iturbi '' ( he did a lot of concerts at military bases ) . gene kelly was a great dancer and frank sinatra an excellent singer , but at the time this movie was made sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to columbia records for four years . kelly was already well-known as a dancer , but iturbi had by then been a world-wide sensation for 20+ years . and as to the lack of a plot , americans did n't need plot . they were tired of war , they were sick with fear for their loved ones , and worried about the future . they needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in the end . they needed music and smiles and joy and romance . this movie and others like it delivered just what was needed . enough lecturing . mouse dancing aside , the best scene in the movie occurs between sinatra and iturbi with each of them `` ignorantly '' complimenting the other 's music . if you have any interest in jose iturbi , the spaniard who conquered more of america than de soto , cortez , and de leon put together , please drop by my website , www.joseiturbi.com , where you can find a plot summary , excerpts from movie reviews `` of the day '' and pictures from this and certain other mgm musicals of the 1940 's , as well as a biography and discography of iturbi . trout
-a very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she connects with . as the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man jack becomes deadly as he threatens lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in , or else have her father die . see now that 's what you happens when you fly coach , stuff like that never happens in first class . -other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight , the other thing that this movie shares with `` flightplan '' is the sheer unbelievability * if that 's a word * of the story . the point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician 's room so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan , but wo n't it have being easier for jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into the hotel 's system ? teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers , so i 'm pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie . -plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about . this is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something . but i 'm 100 % sure that i 'm reading way too much into it . the movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of `` 24 '' so one ca n't be perplexed by such complexities . for all my complaints though , this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done . it 's not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain , but at the same time it does n't require great intelligence to fully enjoy . -i 'd love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really i ca n't . i love rachel mcadams , i love cillian murphy , and i like brian cox , but they do n't really stretch their acting muscles here . it 's not really much of a problem since this is n't the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting is n't the least bit horrible , just not great . wes craven is n't exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this , but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script . it was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing `` cursed '' and as much as i liked him doing something different with this movie , i still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it 's release . -one nice thing about the movie which i really appreciated was just how short the movie was . it is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while , but nowadays it 's like every movie that comes out feels too long , where as this movie just felt like the right length . not too long , and too short . they do n't waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this is n't the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie . being a huge film music geek , i have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by marco beltrami . it 's really nice to see beltrami go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he 's doing now . i really the cool techno/orchestral stuff he does for the main titles . too bad that i ca n't find the soundtrack anywhere , would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime i wanted instead of having to pop in the dvd when i want to hear it . -overall it 's nice for what it is and whiles it 's far from great cinema , should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a half
my kids recently started watching the reruns of this show - both the early episodes on the n , and the later ones on abc family - and they love it . ( i was n't aware the show had even lasted past the first or second season ) i 'm curious as to what prompted all of the cast changes - i 've seen them described as `` highly publicized , '' and yet a half hours searching efforts on the web have revealed nothing but endless comments on how the early episodes were so much better than the later episodes . ( personally , i do n't see a whole lot of difference - the scripts and themes remain largely the same throughout - but they do lose some great people along the way ) my daughter has put the dvds on her wish list , so perhaps the land of special features and commentary will shed some light on all of this . i also wish they 'd done some self-referential humor about the changes - like on `` boy meets world '' where they drop the little sister for an entire season or so , and when a different actor later shows up playing her , they ask her where she 's been and she says `` upstairs , '' or when early series token geek `` minkus '' shows up for the high school graduation , they ask him where he 's been and he says `` over there , '' pointing to the part of the classroom never shown by the camera , before saying `` hey , mr. turner , wait up ! '' and running off screen ( mr. turner being another character who left ) oh well - maybe there will be an e true hollywood story on this or something ? i was just glad to see aunt hilda show up for the finale - she was always one of my favorites - it 's too bad it could n't have been a more encompassing cast reunion . ( the zelda candle just did n't cut it for me )
i have to say , i loved vanishing point . i 've seen the original , and this is a pretty good remake of it . even though it did n't follow the original storyline ( that 's why i gave it 8 out of 10 ) , it was still pretty good and this is probably a better storyline . as for the car , well the dj 's comment at the end about the challenger going 185 mph into the bulldozers is pretty improbable ( and if you look , the speedometer needle was wobbling at 145-150 ) , but even though i did n't see one on the engine in one of the beginning scenes where they show the engine , the original storyline had a supercharged hemi , so it 's possible . for those of you who say aerodynamics would n't allow it , the normally aspirated chrysler 300c of today can go 168 mph , and if you look at that thing , going on a highway with it it 's like pushing a brick wall through the wind at 70 mph . plus , in a wind tunnel test if you put an air dam on the challenger it would probably be more aerodynamic .
i do n't know how anyone could hate this movie . it is so funny . it took a unique mind to come up with this storyline . it 's not your typical alien movie . these aliens are so stupid and confused . you need to rent it at least once .
one word can describe this movie and that is weird . i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting . well it was , the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge . on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not . very strange , if you are a fan of animation/science-fiction you might want to check this out .
religious bigotry is rampant everywhere . australia is not immune to it . a dingo snatched a baby and the mother was tried and sent to prison for having `` killed '' her own baby . i do n't mean to spoil the story for you , but you need to know the basics before getting knee-deep in what caused this woman to find herself inside a prison . buy or rent the movie and discover how deep-seated human hatred of those who are different continues to thrive around the globe . this is a very moving motion picture with a terrific cast of actors . both meryl streep ( with her famous aussie accent ) and sam neill , whose accent is his native-born pronunciation , are outstanding . those with supporting roles are also quite good . you will remember this movie for many years . see it !
worth watching twice because of the rapid-paced causal shifts among several compelling stories , `` bug '' emerges as a wholly satisfying work of art that plays ever-optimistic love against myriad examples of frustrating reality . my favorite characters are wallace ( john carroll lynch ) whose overriding concern for life -- from that of a cockroach to the airline passengers for whom he is partially responsible -- frames the film ; olive ( christina kirk ) , who spends considerable time creating surreal but tasty meals for her impossible husband ernie ( chris bauer ) ; and mitchell , a cable tv technician with unbounded trust in fortune cookie messages : `` you will meet the girl of your dreams . '' against such optimism are the forces of quirky reality , all generated by actions of the characters : parking tickets , a clogged drain in a chinese food/donut shop , tv disruption , a crushed auto fender , an obliterated dinner reservation that eventually results in cancellation of a hawaiian vacation . the film is funny : olive getting drunk at a chippendale performance , johnston ( michael hitchcock ) as a customer service rep attempting to deal with an irate customer , the germ-obsessive cyr ( brian cox ) facing a restaurant inspector , dwight ( jamie kennedy ) reacting to his girlfriend 's refusal to have children by writing hostile chinese cookie fortunes : `` your girlfriend is lying to you '' and the guy who falls asleep while manning a jackhammer because he spent the night looking for his girlfriend 's missing cat . a minor story with public cable access host ( darryl theirse ) and a local acting teacher reading from `` the boy in the bubble '' expresses the major theme : love comes from the heart . `` bug '' entertains on much the same level as `` trains , planes and automobiles '' but on a lower budget and with a fresher eye .
this is a great little film , that 's very unique , and creative , with some great plot twists and wonderful performances ! . all the characters are great , and the story while bizarre , is fascinating and very interesting , plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this ! . it 's very hard to describe this movie , because it really is quite bizarre , it 's a comedy/romance , one minute then it turns into a thriller the next , however it was still very entertaining all the same , plus nicole 's russian accent was fantastic , and extremely convincing . chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together , and i loved vincent cassel 's performance ! , plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise ! . the ending was very cute , and it 's unpredictable throughout ! , plus this movie is quite underrated as well ! . you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is scammed , and i thought all the characters were really likable , plus the finale is especially good.this is nicole 's movie though , and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance ! . this is a great little film , that 's very unique , and creative , with some great plot twists and wonderful performances ! , i highly recommend this one ! . the direction is very good ! . jez butterworth does a very good job here , with great camera work , solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace ! . the acting is wonderful ! . nicole kidman , is stunningly gorgeous ! , and is amazing as always , she is incredibly sexy , very likable , had one of the coolest accents , added a lot of presence , had very good chemistry with ben chaplin , and had a very mysterious character ! , she was amazing . ( kidman rules ! ! ! ! ) . ben chaplin is great here , he is extremely likable , had a cool character , had very good chemistry with kidman , the only thing i did n't like was him taking out his anger out on kidman , even though what she did was wrong , and i loved how he got revenge in the end ! . vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain , yes he was ott , but he was very intense and quite creepy at times , this role was perfect for him . mathieu kassovitz is ok here , but did n't have much to do . rest of the cast are fine . overall i highly recommend this one ! . * * * 1/2 out of 5
it is n't always easy to explain what a movie is like , but this time i think i 've found it . it reminded me of two movies : trainspotting ( small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in schotland ) and the blair witch project ( because of the style of filming ) . it 's about the loyalty between two friends , one of them is coming out of jail , the other one has n't been caught yet . with a stolen vehicle they drive through the scottish countryside but than run out of petrol . as they try to find some fuel , they find a farm in the middle of nowhere . the farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them . than it all goes wrong . one of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer 's daughter and they have to run . what follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of schotland . the two friends literally have to run for their lives . apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time . ok , that 's not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place : the scottish countryside , but i still find that quite amazing . especially because this is n't actually a bad movie . it 's perhaps not the greatest movie ever , but they still can be proud of what they achieved . i had a nice time watching it and overall i enjoyed the movie . i give it a 7/10 .
i saw this when it first came to video , my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably 12 at the time ... what stood out for me was the lack of mid-movie conflict that so many movies have , where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just do n't say the one thing that you 're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal , that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say . this is what i like the most about the movie i guess , that the main characters do n't do mean things to each other halfway through ... they do n't break up and make up , they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on . these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track , they 're not that different . loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family , and cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone . anyway , i saw this movie posted on hulu and had to watch it again ... sure there 's plot holes if you analyze the script and no , woog and dweeb should n't be eating hot dogs since they would have been herbivores in reality . now , what detracts from the film is it 's unexpected scariness . little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr. screweyes . and , the addition of him halfway through the movie ( though it 's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance ) is too abrupt ... there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie , perhaps to show that it 's not that scary without the the dinosaurs . i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie , so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half . considering the target audience , who i 'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues ... i think i 'll give it a pass on those factors too , and just enjoy the story . it 's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind ... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years i think .
hickory dickory dock was a good poirot mystery . i confess i have not read the book , despite being an avid agatha christie fan . the adaptation is n't without its problems , there were times when the humour , and there were valiant attempts to get it right , was a little overdone , and the events leading up to the final solution were rather rushed . i also thought there were some slow moments so some of the mystery felt padded . however , i loved how hickory dickory dock was filmed , it had a very similar visual style to the brilliant abc murders , and it really set the atmosphere , what with the dark camera work and dark lighting . the darker moments were somewhat creepy , this was helped by one of the most haunting music scores in a poirot adaptation , maybe not as disturbing as the one in one two buckle my shoe , which gave me nightmares . the plot is complex , with all the essential ingredients , though not as convoluted as buckle my shoe , and in some way that is a good thing . the acting was very good , david suchet is impeccable ( i know i ca n't use this word forever but i ca n't think of a better word to describe his performance in the series ) as poirot , and phillip jackson and pauline moran do justice to their integral characters brilliantly . and the students had great personalities and well developed on the whole , particularly damian lewis as leonard . all in all , solid mystery but does n't rank along the best . 7.5/10 bethany cox
`` pandora 's clock '' is a gripping suspense/thriller that 's a cross between a virus movie and a disaster film . this movie , which aired in two parts on nbc in its debut showing in 1996 , is about an airplane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers just happens to be carrying this disease . the u.s. government debates on whether the plane should be destroyed or not , while the pilot ( richard dean anderson ) and a virus expert ( daphne zuniga ) try to figure something out to avoid disaster . i 'm not really a big fan of tv movies and miniseries , but i liked `` pandora 's clock '' . it 's one heck of a thrill ride . jane leeves ( tv 's `` frasier '' ) , robert loggia , and edward herrmann ( as the president ) also star . * * * ( out of four )
i happen to like leslie howard , in his better films . yet , for some reason , his performance in of human bondage never has moved me tremendously . i first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by dirk bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed . this is not usually the case ( off hand i think of ashley wilkes as a man who might be betrayed , if he and scarlett o'hara were meant to be an item by margaret mitchell - but ashley loved melonie , not scarlett ) . howard could play any type , and a role like r. j. mitchell or professor henry higgins is not one who is betrayed . * ( * one can make the case that philip armstrong scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in 49th parallel , but they are nazis who consider him - a liberal , westerner , canadian - fair game to double cross in wartime . it is n't the same as emotional betrayal , and howard does not shrivel up as a result , but faces the nazis and captures one after beating him up . ) i think what the reviewer meant was that howard could be soulful - or try to be soulful . witness his poet - dreamer - wanderer in the petrified forrest . but that character was not betrayed , except by history perhaps ( as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by humphrey bogart ) . the character of philip carey in somerset maugham 's of human bondage is soulful too . he is sensitive for several reasons . he has an interest in art and tries to become a painter - but unlike the artist strickland in the moon and sixpence he has no real talent . so he decides to concentrate on medical studies , accentuated by a club foot condition he has . here he is a man with low self-esteem who is set up to be betrayed . philip finds that betrayal in the form of mildred a cockney waitress ( bette davis ) who is mercenary and as selfish as they come . why philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film , but he does find the woman fascinating . and she finds him an easy meal ticket . ironically in being so captivated by this slut , philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him ( kay johnson and frances dee ) , and are more fit to be his mate . he also keeps finding himself forgiving davis when she has affairs with other men ( alan hale and reginald denny - the latter a friend of howard 's ) . although howard 's performance captures the doormat tendency of philip towards mildred , he really does not show enough passion ( until late in the movie , when he turns on her ) . that is why i find i never cared for his performance here - it lacks any reality . his later tortured insistence in gone with the wind that he loves olivia de haviland , not vivian leigh , has more consistency with a man in love . but the performance of davis as mildred makes the film important . she had a wide variety of parts up to 1934 , like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in the man who played god or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in fog over frisco or the mouse-like secretary in three on a match . as mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitch . curiously her performance was not all of one note . while she uses and abuses howard for two thirds of the film , culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her , her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating , and her inability to keep any honest jobs . when howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes ( he asks what happened to her baby - she tells him the baby died and howard says brusquely that he is glad , which is hardly the response she expects ) . in the end howard does finally get his life in order , but mildred ends a casualty ( ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend denny on a medical call ) . the motion picture academy of arts and sciences did fail to nominate davis in 1934 ( leading to the largest write - in campaign in it 's history , and a permanent change in it 's rules ) , but davis was established as a star . in one year she won the oscar as joyce heth in dangerous . and in two years she co-starred with howard again ( as equal stars ) in the petrified forrest .
after having seen a lot of greek movies i feel very suspicious against most of them . but after watching this i felt astonished . the movies is great without a big try . you can not claim that the screenplay is so great or the photography is perfect or something technical . it 's a real story and it is happening in greek rural areas in places forgotten from god . the movie is like a punch in the stomach and i would really wish that things are not like this . it obviously talks about the xenophobia of the greek people ( the ignorance ) to anything different . the problem of this guy is not that he is an ex-convicted . the problem is that he is not one of these people . he is different and they do not want them ( that 's why all the good things he is doing turn boomerang to him ) . and also speaks about the apathy of the people , because there are some people who are against the hunting of the king , but they do not dare to say their opinion . in the end you can clearly see the hypocrisy of the society being religious and trying to act like god says , but at the same time acting so unfairly to the king . this shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or their beliefs according to the established system . in the end you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story , meaning that you can understand and be part of this society only if you want to become one of them . if you want to remain different and even alone , you are lost ( and it is not far from reality ) i think it is tragic that the story is real and this should be a bell for everybody . no comment for the main actor because he is already given an award and i believe that his play was great . small comment for hatzisavvas ( plays the policeman ) , he is like a dinosaur , he has played a lot of roles and i 'm sure that this role for him was very easy but he plays it so great that you can not deny him a big bravo . i definitely recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a good greek movie .
in iran , women are not admitted to soccer games . officially it 's because they are to be spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience . but of course it is about sexism . women are lower forms of human beings . some brave girls oppose this and try to get into the stadium by using different tricks . they are caught by soldiers and hold in a kind of cage , until the police will come and pick them up . despite the insane situation , this is a film with lots of humor . it 's also encouraging to see how people always find different ways of fighting oppression . you 'll get touched at the same time as you have lots of laughs . good job by director jafar panahi . this is in many ways a heroic comedy .
* contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques , so read at your own risk ! * i loved this film . the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life . i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen . for instance , in one scene , leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen . her face is huge in the back and leo 's is in the foreground . one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train , a scene shot in an almost political poster style , with facial close ups . it reminded me of battleship potemkin , that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore . same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub ... you can only see the red water on the side . it is one of the things i love about von trier , his understatement of horror , which ends up making it all the more creepy . the use of text in the film was unique , like when leo 's character is pushed by the word , `` werewolf . '' i have never seen anything like that in a film . the use of black comedy in this film was well done . ernst-hugo järegård is great as leo 's uncle . it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom ( riget . ) this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww2 and all the chaos , easier to take . it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy . it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them . yet some people , like leo , are tuned in , but do nothing positive about it . the voice over , done expertly well by max von sydow , is amusing too . it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leo 's head , which at times is a scary place to be . the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they do n't choose a side . i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark , where bjork 's character does n't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction . actually , at one time , von trier seemed anti-woman to me , by making breaking the waves and dancer , but now i know his male characters do n't fare well either ! i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer , when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions , but of course , they never do !
ghost train is a fine and entertaining film , typical of the better british comedy chillers of the 1930s and 40s . the antics of comedian arthur askey are not as funny as they once apparently were , but this can be overcome by viewing him as a period piece or a curiosity . for a low-budget wartime production , ghost train is atmospheric , effective , and it provides some genuine suspense . great fun for a dark ( and , yes , stormy ) night . lighten up , take off the critic 's hat , and enjoy .
or released on dvd or screened on a cable channel like amer . life tv network . i have been watching another favorite , `` voyage to the bottom of the sea '' , as well as `` lost in space '' and land of giants '' . they 've been showing them forever but are n't receptive to suggestions for other shows . my father and i were big fans as i was already a big science/electronics nut , ( still am ) and my father was an old school chum of nader . they both attended oxy together . i still have memories of several of the episodes even though i was only 9 . more so than any show that old . i think it was televised on sat . after `` bonanza '' . some of the episodes i recall are the one where he takes the experimental drug that slows down action . or the one where he body surfs the big ones , ( i did that too ! ) or the one where there was a mine cave in and he conveys how to use mind control to have the trapped people slow their breathing by entering a trance-like state . that is the one show that i wish i could see again . i got my wish with the original `` outer limits '' and `` sci-fi theater ... john
before seeing this , i was put off by the subject matter , but this is not your average triumph over adversity story . although this is technically about blind tibetan kids climbing mt . everest , there is so much more to it . this movie shows the very strong , often contradictory personalities of two highly accomplished blind adults leading the children , erik and sabriye . erik is an american blind mountain climber/athlete and sabriye is a blind german academic who started a school in lhasa tibet . they are both exceptional in their own ways , but disagree on what will really build confidence in the kids . erik wants them to reach the summit while sabriye wants them to enjoy erik as a role model and take pleasure in moment . the nuances are complicated and one walks away not really being sure who was right or if the whole climb was a mistake or a great idea . the most profound scenes are with the tibetan children themselves and the hardships they faced before finding their way to the school . the most moving for me was the story of tashi , a frail teenager who grew up on the streets after his parents abandoned him . i could watch a whole movie on his life and was happy to learn that thanks to the school , he is now running a successful small business with some of his fellow students . if you liked spellbound or murderball , you will love this .
really the tale of two cocky brothers and their respective falls from grace ( via drug addiction ) and later redemption . one brother , a self-proclaimed genius played by james franco is your typical sensitive but intelligent man-child . the other brother is a hard-working future doctor who becomes less judgmental as he himself falls prey to addiction while dealing with the stress of living up to his family 's expectations for both children . not too heavy handed as drug fables are want to be , and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that drug problems bring about . i 'd recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and commend james franco for his efforts in what was obviously a labor of love .
when i first got my n64 when i was five or six , i fell in love with it , and my first game was super mario 64.and i loved it ! the graphics were great for it 's time , a good plot , great courses and above all , the best music i heard in a nintendo game . i do n't remember the plot completely , but i think princess peach was kidnapped by bowser , and mario has to rescue her.the object of the game is to get 120 stars from the curses in the castle.each had about five or six challnges to get the stars.there are secert parts of the castle , where you can get more stars.but of course , you have beat bowser . * i think there are three levels to beat bowser on * lets start with the characters.mario is the main character , and gets helpful advice from toad , so he is basically one of your only alliances.i heard that luigi and yoshi are in the game towards the end.the main villain is bowser , and there are a bunch of other characters like boo and goomba.the characters are really great . next , how about the graphics ? people say gameplay is more important then the graphics , and i agree completely.but with he great plot , there are great graphics.especially for it 's time.i have a whole bunch of other nintendo games like 007 and their graphics do n't compare to super mario.bright colors , great effects and awesome sound effects.i found the graphics in the water courses very very good.next to the bowser world ones , it has the best graphics in the game . now , the music.this is my favorite part of the game.growing up , when i played this at a young age , i 'd gladly leave the game on all night so the music would put me to sleep.especially the music from jolly roger bay , which was peaceful and wonderful.there are others that are great too , especially in , once again , the worlds with bowser , are the ones that stick with me the most and are my favorites . this game was my favorite past time as a developing gamer , and i love it.this game gets 10/10 or * * * * * ( 5 ) / * * * * * ( 5 ) go play the game !
wow , i forgot how great this movie was until i stumbled upon it while looking through the garage . it 's a kind of strange combination of a bio of michael jackson , a collection of musical vignettes , and a story about a super hero fighting to save some little kids . the vignettes are good ( especially speed demon ) , but the best part of this movie is the super hero segment , in which michael jackson turns into a car , a robot , and finally a spaceship ( and it 's just as weird as it sounds ) . joe pesci is hilarious , and has enough cool imagery and great music to entertain throughout ! the real gem however is the incredible `` smooth criminal '' video , which makes the movie worth owning for that part alone !
this movie was highly entertaining . the soundtrack ( bian adams ) is simply beautiful and inspiring . even more impressive is brian adams doing all the songs in french as well . the score is also uplifting and dramatic . the movie is made from a mix of traditional animation , combined with computer generated images . the result is truly stunning . i watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it . the story is compelling and well narrated . i do n't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7 . definately a keeper in my household .
what if a platoon of g.i . 's from the japanese army were to be send back in time 400 years right in the middle of the feudal wars that led to the formation of the tokugawa shogunate ? great pitch right ? the movie does exactly what it says on the tin . thankfully the writers did n't bother to explain the , usually ridiculous in sci-fi movies , scientific mumbo jumbo of time transport . no how 's or why 's . they just did . however the time transport sequence itself is trippy as hell and quite beautiful , if not a bit dated . not as silly as one would imagine . the rest of the movie follows the premise to a t. but while it loses a bit of steam with the various subplots that follow the g.i.s arrival to medieval japan , it picks up with a devastating battle sequence . undoubtedly it 's the main order of the day . the whole concept and by extension the movie itself , was probably originated from this simple pitch : what if g.i . 's equipped with the latest in modern warfare were to fight samurais ? and boy does it deliver . the main battle sequence that spans more than half an hour is probably one of the best of its kind in 70 's action/war movies . not only is it relentless and exhausting in pace and length , it 's also a terrific mish-mash of styles and techniques that only unique premises like g.i . samurai can deliver . i mean , where else would you get the chance to feature tanks , ninjas complete with shuriikens , a helicopter and samurais in the same shot ? the g.i . platoon led by lieutenant iba tears literally through hundreds of extras , gunning them down with machine guns , mortars , grenades and tanks . this mish-mash of styles is with one foot firmly rooted in the sprawling jidai-geki epic of kurosawa 's kagemusha or hiroshi inagaki 's samurai banners , while the other is in western action and war movies . there are stylistic touches ( like the wonderful slow-motion shots and bloody violence ) that bring sam peckinpah or enzo g. castellari circa keoma to mind . japanese cinema has always been influenced by westerns and other hollywood works and vice versa , and g.i . samurai effortlessly turns this east-meets-west melting pot into an exciting film . the film-makers thankfully take the whole thing seriously and the movie benefits immensely from it . not that tongue-in-cheek mentality is completely absent , it 's just that it does n't try to pander to so-bad-it's-good audiences that enjoy laughing at their movies . the budget was probably hefty , as it is evident in the hundreds of extras , elaborate costumes ( very decent for a production that is not a traditional jidai-geki ) and special effects . the camera-work and editing are all top notch , almost better than a movie with no higher artistic ambitions deserves . it 's not withouts its flaws either of course . there are many `` song '' scenes , where all sorts of 70 's japanese rock , disco and country songs play over montages ( there 's a bonding scene , a love-interest scene , a `` war is hell '' scene etc ) . the songs themselves are pretty lame and corny and detract from the whole thing . although it clocks at a whooping 140 minutes , it flies like a bullet for the most part . still some scenes , flashbacks and subplots in the first half could have been clipped for a tighter effect . the cast also deserves a mention , featuring such prominent names as sonny chiba , isao natsuyagi ( goyokin , samurai wolf ) , tsunehiko watase ( the yakuza papers ) and hiroyuki sanada , all of them hitting the right notes .
cosimo ( luis guzman ) ends up in prison for car burglary and there he 's given the plan for the perfect heist from a lifer in prison ; so he has to get out of jail , fast . he tells his girlfriend rosalind ( patricia clarkson ) to find a man who will do his time in prison for some money . but no one wants to do the time for cosimo 's crime and yet everybody seems to know a guy who will do that . soon bad boxer pero mahalovic ( sam rockwell ) founds out the details of this so called `` perfect job '' . first of all , i think this movie was very funny and from my point of view i would recommend it to everyone . this movie is remake of italian comedy `` i soliti ignoti '' . i did n't watch the italian original so i can not judge or compare those two movies . but `` welcome to collinwood '' is great comedy for itself , about four people trying to rob the money from the vault in one house . everyone gave their part of brilliance from this movie cast . really excellent movie for these actors : sam rockwell , william h. macy ( great ) , isaiah washington , michael jeter ( great ) , luis guzmán , patricia clarkson , jennifer esposito and finally george clooney gave their share in this project . maybe to say that this movie is only comedy , is n't fair . this is more then that . because of one difference . all of thieves in this movie have very small wishes when they are asked : what will they do with their money ? it is mostly securing their future in very humble way . this fact goes beyond comedy into the soul of that criminals . and not only them but also cop babitch , who is presented like corrupted one ; so here directors russo presents us fact that criminals and cop are the same . actually all in collinwood are ; and not only in collinwood , cause all people chase money , on legal or illegal way . i do n't like all movies were audience eventually likes and cheers for thieves . but , this one is exception . you have to love them all . riley with his little baby and wife in jail . toto with his pants . cosimo with his line : `` your mother 's a whore ! '' and all others . they are just like characters in my favorite comic , alan ford . they all trying to make some money , but simply they are out of luck . but they all did one good deed : they gave money to riley , so he can get his wife out of prison . they are all heroes in my eyes , cause lots of `` honest '' people would n't do that .
this film is n't just about a school shooting , in fact its never even seen . but that just adds to the power this film has . its about people and how they deal with tragedy . i know it was shown to the students who survived the columbine shooting and it provided a sense of closure for a lot of them . the acting is superb . all three main actors ( busy phillips , erika christensen and victor garber ) are excellent in their roles ... i highly recommend this film to anyone . its one of those films that makes you talk about it after you see it . it provokes discussion of not only school shootings but of human emotions and reactions to all forms of tragedy . it is a tear-jerker but it is well worth it and one i will watch time and time again
this is a very moving picture about 3 forty-something best friends in a small england town . one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor , when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever . definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you ! a powerful piece of work . this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time . * spoiler ! ! ! spoiler alert ! ! spoiler ! ! * the main character is taken by her young , handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blossoms . her two jealous `` friends '' play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy . she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop . in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together . ( in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted )
like many americans , i was first introduced to the works of hayao miyazaki when i saw `` spirited away . '' i fell in love with the film and have seen it many times . now i am on a search to see every film by miyazaki . one of his earlier works is `` castle in the sky . '' although it 's still enjoyable , it 's not as good as `` spirited away '' ( though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair ) . a young boy named pazu ( james van der beek ) is working in a mine late one night , when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky . when she wakes up the next morning , she introduces herself as sheeta ( anna paquin ) . but sheeta has a secret , and before he knows it , pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates , the army and a lost floating city . going into a film by hayao miyazaki means you can expect one thing : a sense of wonder and magic . many filmmakers have tried , but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like miyazaki . watching a film by miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood . because the film is animated , dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words . it also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors . the voice acting is varied . james van der beek fares best . he brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of pazu that is perfect for the character . anna paquin is nearly as good as sheeta . she 's frightened by the events going on around her , but she knows what she has to do . mark hamill is unrecognizable as the evil muska . he 's dangerous and wants something from sheeta , and will do anything to get it . the other voices are bad . cloris leachman is awful as dola . leachman may have won an oscar for `` the last picture show , '' but she 's annoying as the pirate leader . leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that 's nearly always monotonous . it 's so bad it nearly ruins the film ! jim cummings is an effective voice-over actor , but he 's miscast as the general . i would definitely recommend seeing `` castle in the sky . '' i 'll probably end up buying it myself . but even though it 's not as good as `` spirited away , '' it 's still pretty good .
i 'm not a follower of a certain movie genre . i classify movies only as industrial or non-industrial . valentine is the second industrial movie of the director jamie blanks , after his urban legends . unlike urban legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak . yet again unlike urban legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic , and that is what makes valentine the best . as the first basic and iconic element , the growing hatred of the serial killer is so down-to-earth . since his secondary school years , he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends , who have made fun of him . when you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie , you will come to see this point of view of humanism : `` noone is entirely good or evil . in fact , somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted . '' just because the story line and the direction is very weak , we are not as satisfied as we deserved . the second iconic element is , of course , the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s ' super starlets : my favourite is jessica cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed . an arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in , while she was playing hide-and-seek with her blind date , never able to met with . katherine heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables . denise richards is killed third , while she just found a valentines ' day gift for her at a whirlpool bath . jessica capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way , then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer . marley shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know , 'cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed . finally , benita ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer , david boreanaz . the third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene , the valentines ' day celebration at dorothy 's house scenes and ultimately the killing themes . everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as i know . hard rock never suits better within a serial killer-mystery movie .
spoilers tom and jerry is a classic cartoon , with a flawless idea , and almost every single short is a gem . while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts , there is not way you can hate this cartoon . sure , it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes , and i can say that i agree , but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great , but some are just better than others . well , this would fit into `` others . '' here is the plot of fraidy cat . tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast , and becomes easily frightened . jerry observes how scared he is , and tries to scare him even more than he already is . he creates scary dilemmas for tom , and tom becomes scared out of his wits , and his lives . jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it , thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost . tom finds out that jerry did all of this , and chases him . tom then accidentally bites the house maid . however , at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup . overall , this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there , but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time . it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this . the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short , but it felt like something was missing in this . it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts . anyway , this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons , but it is still nice . 7/10
i liked this film a lot . it 's dark , it 's not a bullet-dodging , car-chasing numb your brain action movie . a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague , leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions . it 's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds . in the end , motivated by love or vengeance , or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is `` right '' . 'will god ever forgive us for what we 've done ? ' - it 's not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do , what he 's good at , what he 's been trained to do . denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly ca n't think of one bad movie he 's done - and he 's got a great supporting cast . i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone .
funny . sad . charming . these are all words that floated through my head while i was watching this beautiful , simple film . it is rare that a movie truly moves me , but `` shall we dance ? '' accomplished that with grace to spare . gentle humor mixed in with occasional subtle agony made this easily one of the best experiences of my movie-viewing history . it left me with a quiet sense of exultation , but with a small touch of sadness mixed in . and the dancing , oh yes , the dancing . even if you are not a lover of the art , or ca n't put one foot in front of another , the steps displayed here will take your breath away , and make you want to sign up for classes as fast as you can . it was absolutely enchanting , even the parts that show sugiyama 's ( touchingly portrayed by koji yakusho ) stilted steps when he was first learning to dance were lovely in a humorous , child-like way . and yet , this film was not entirely about dancing , but more about the subtleties of human behavior and feelings . we witness a shy man learning to express his repressed feelings through dance , a beautiful dance instructor rediscovering her love for the art , and the personal growth of every member of the wonderful supporting cast . beauty . pain . emotion . all the love and little agonies of life are here , expressed with the delicate feeling of a fine japanese watercolor painting combined with the emotional strength and grace of the culture .
this , `` prodigal son '' and `` eastern condors '' are my favourite sammo hung films . the fat dragon is fatter in this outing than he was in `` condors '' , but he 's no less sure-footed as director or actor . he is , in fact , at the top of his form and delivers a devastating , brutal actioner that boasts half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate , sweet love story also . love and romance are not the director 's priorities here , but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action , and insure that viewers do n't hit the fast-forward button between the physical clashes . the opening scene , which features a funny light sabre duel , sets a solid but deceptive tone . a sequence in which sammo 's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp , comic tone . the fast and furious stick fight between sammo and lau kar leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp , superb direction , and easily one of the best ever of its type . the film 's violence escalates slowly until , finally , when the climactic showdown comes , we are subjected to some of the most brutal altercations ever seen in a sammo production . the director/actor 's assault on billy chow and a house filled with angry , menacing opponents is a bone-cracking , physically punishing delight . terrific on every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made . great score , too .
at the height of the 'celebrity big brother ' racism row in 2007 ( involving shilpa shetty and the late jade goody ) , i condemned on an internet forum those ' c.b.b . ' fans who praised the show , after years of bashing 'racist ' '70 's sitcoms such as 'curry & chips ' & 'love thy neighbour ' . i thought they were being hypocritical , and said so . 'it ai n't half hot mum ' was then thrown into the argument , with some pointing out it had starred an english actor blacked-up . well , yes , but michael bates had lived in india as a boy , and spoke urdu fluently . the show 's detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer 'rangi ram ' . the noted indian character actor , renu setna , said in a 1995 documentary 'perry & croft : the sitcoms ' that he was upset when he heard bates had landed the role , but added : `` no indian actor could have played that role as well as bates. '' . indeed . 'mum ' was perry and croft 's companion show to 'dad 's army ' ; also set in wartime , the sedate english town of walmington-on-sea had been replaced by the hot , steamy jungles of india , in particularly a place called deolali , where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops , among them bombadier solomons ( george layton , his first sitcom role since 'doctor in charge ' ) , camp gunner 'gloria ' beaumont ( melvyn hayes ) , diminutive gunner 'lofty ' sugden , 'lah de-dah ' gunner graham ( john clegg ) , and gunner parkins ( the late christopher mitchell ) . presiding over this gang of misfits was the bellicose sergeant-major williams ( the brilliant windsor davies ) , who regarded them all as 'poofs ' . his frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying ( though he was nice to parkins , whom he thought was his illegitimate son ! ) . then there was ever-so english colonel reynolds ( donald hewlett ) and dimwitted captain ashwood ( michael knowles ) . rangi was like a wise old sage , beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by quoting obscure hindu proverbs . he loved being bearer so much he came to regard himself as practically british . his friends were the tea-making char wallah ( the late dino shafeek , who went on to 'mind your language ' ) and the rope pulling punka wallah ( babar bhatti ) . so real indians featured in the show - another point its detractors ignore . shafeek also provided what was described on the credits as 'vocal interruptions ' ( similar to the '40 's songs used as incidental music on 'dad 's army ' ) . each edition closed with him warbling 'land of hope & glory ' only to be silenced by a 'shut up ! ' from williams . the excellent opening theme was penned by jimmy perry and derek taverner . though never quite equalling 'dad 's army ' in the public 's affections , 'mum ' nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons . in 1975 , davies and estelle topped the charts with a cover version of that old chestnut 'whispering grass ' . they then recorded an entire album of old chestnuts , entitled ( what else ? ) 'sing lofty ! ' . the show hit crisis point three years later when bates died of cancer . rather than recast the role of 'rangi ' , the writers just let him be quietly forgotten . when george layton left , the character of 'gloria ' took his place as 'bombadier ' , providing another source of comedy . the last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave india by boat for blighty , the char wallah watching them go with great sadness ( as did viewers ) . repeats have been few and far between ( mainly on u.k. gold ) all because of its so-called 'dodgy ' reputation . this is strange . for one thing , the show was not specifically about racism . if a white man blacked-up is so wrong , why does david lean 's 1984 film ' a passage to india ' still get shown on television ? ( it featured alec guinness as an indian , and won two oscars ! ) . it was derived from jimmy perry 's own experiences . some characters were based on real people ( the sergeant-major really did refer to his men as 'poofs ' ) . i take the view that if you are going to put history on television , get it right . sanitizing the past , no matter how unsavoury it might seem to modern audiences , is fundamentally dishonest . 'mum ' was both funny and truthful , and viewers saw this . thank heavens for d.v.d . 's i say . time to stop this review . as williams would say : `` i 'll have no gossiping in this jungle ! ''
i 've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it was n't as successful ( commercially or artistically ) as it should have been , and discovered considerable artistic merit -- which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing . first of all , this movie attempts `` serious '' science-fiction , social commentary , more than action-adventure . there is action in it , but that 's not really what it 's about . if you focus on that , you 'll end up with ( as others have noted ) a bad `` aliens '' clone . but , again , that 's not what it 's about . the movie is really about todd 's ( kurt russell ) transformation from human to near-machine and back to human ( mostly * back * ) . but because it 's not trying to give you a typically glib hollywood style answer , kurt russell must make this transformation without speaking , and largely without broad expressions . and he really does a wonderful job -- it can take two viewings to appreciate it . the surrounding `` social logic '' is flawed and it 's never adequately explained whether todd 's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human-ness or what , but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for russell 's ( easy to underestimate ) talent .
* some spoilers * i was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticisms ( acting , dated dialogue , unclear storyline ) unfounded . belafonte is great as a brandoesque , menacing , swearing spirit who must earn his wings but is realistically ill-equipped from his past life to do so . he learns too late how empty his hustling , materialistic life was without love . mostel is likewise great as an anguished man with his dying wife fanny . in spite of his prayers for a miracle , his bitterness prevents him from accepting ( or believing ) in one . the two social worlds the characters represent alternately collide and complement the other , the result being hilarious and touchingly sad . the perplexing ending is actually quite consistent with the rest of the film . after looking everywhere for belafonte , mostel looks up to see a falling feather , and he frantically reaches for it as if he 's finally willing to believe in angels and miracles . but belafonte was n't allowed to finish his miracle ( either to restore fanny 's health or mostel 's faith ) , so he never got his wings . the feather floats tauntingly out of mostel 's grasp , a metaphor for both men 's live : it 's too late and you do n't get a second chance . like `` it 's a wonderful life , '' this movie is magical , wonderful , funny , but terribly tragic .
then you must see this film , to understand the reality . having read the book , ms. duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with bipolar disorder ; formerly labeled manic-depression . it is hard to believe that in this day and age , people still critique others with emotional problems , or those who seek psychiatric help . regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists , and this is unfortunate . in this film , the audience sees the pain and suffering ms. duke had been through , especially as a child . many of us may remember her from the teenage `` patty duke show '' . she was a household name in america by age 15 . you learn of her exploitation by the ross ' ( well played by howard hesseman ) . as she was growing up in the 1950 's , the stigma was in full-force . however , we see as she advances in her career , yet the illness becomes worse . she goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity ; even marries someone whom she divorces the next week ; and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother . all these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy , and medication . a recent survey released by nami ( national alliance on mental illness ) recorded that a majority of us adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder . it also was released that one in five respondents to the poll believed that people could control their illness without medication if they wanted to . ( bp magazine , winter 2006 ) if you watch this film , you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not `` pull herself up by her bootstraps '' and `` get well '' until she was educated about her disorder , and received proper treatment . thank you , ms. duke , for being an advocate against ignorance and prejudice .
here 's a real weirdo for you . it starts out with another take-off on the psycho shower scene , on campus , then gets crazier when several coeds and their doofy boyfriends head south for spring break . the trouble starts when they drive into the redneck county ruled by homicidal sheriff dean . one of the college cuties wanders into the woods , witnesses a murder by the sheriff and has her head blown open . then it 's lets-rip-off macon county line-time as dean stalks , traps and slaughters the witless witnesses one by one . tony march is on-target as the evil , shotgun-happy dean . the movie 's overall tone is truly disturbing . the ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film ; it 's also a study in despair . shallow grave is a must for misanthropes , misogynists and nihilists the world over .
this film , as low budget as it may be , is one of the best psychological thrillers i 've ever seen . if you accept that it 's low budget from the start , you can appreciate just how good of a story it is , how very well written the script is , and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money . all the elements of a great film are here . the visuals , though shot on digital , were gorgeous in places . the bizarre , dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog , that scene was just amazing . it 's such a trippy piece of work , but not done in a pretentious way , and because of that i have a whole lot of respect for this film . it comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating , and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there .
this film has a special place in my heart , as when i caught it the first time , i was teaching adult literacy . it rang very true to me and even an outstanding student i had at the time . there are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion , and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation . excellent performances by jane fonda and robert deniro that rank with their best work , a great turn by a young martha plimpton , an inspiring story line , and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience .
star rating : * * * * * the works * * * * just misses the mark * * * that little bit in between * * lagging behind * the pits mike atherton ( dudikoff ) is peacefully making his way in the wild west when he spots a group of men mistreating a lady . being a gentleman , he naturally steps in and puts a stop to this and in doing so kills the son of a nasty enforcer . this is just the beginning of a all guns blazing battle to the finish from which there will be only one winner . m dudikoff is an action star who 's never truly managed to take off with me . maybe i discovered him too late and after the other film i saw with him in it last monday , the human shield , it was just another dud ( ha ha ) added to the list . but i have a thing for westerns , being films that just sort of transport me to a different time and place and provide real escapist entertainment and with this dudikoff has picked one of his better scripts , as his films go anyway . the film hits a few low points in the shape of a naff central villain , sounding like a blank marlon brando and some generally ropey acting from some of the cast , along with the obligatory cheap looking sets . but if , for some strange reason , your life ever depended on watching a dudikoff film , this would be one of your best choices . * * *
having not seen all the films released in 2002 , i ca n't say that this is the best film of the year . i can say that it is the best film i have seen all year . most american films featuring black people either obsess over the american preoccupation with `` race relations '' , or fall into the cliches of the inner city ghetto , with every sterotype imaginable spouting ebonic-phrased slang . antwone fisher stands proudly alone in this regard : race is irrelevant , save for one fight that may , or may not , have been provoked by a racial slur . antwone fisher 's story is one that should find resonance with any empathic individual . he is understatedly , and thoughtfully , portrayed by derek luke . denzel washington , while obviously using his star power to have the film made , sticks to the background for the most part , and allows the film to be the antwone fisher story . at a time when bet , and popular culture in general want to maintain the ghetoization of a large number of americans ( and canadians too , you know ) , this is a film that speaks to the humanity in all of us . i just hope that the non-black audience will go see this film for that humanity , rather than avoiding it because they feel that there are no characters or actors in the movie whom they can identify with . that would be a sad commentary on race-relations in north america in and of itself .
ok ... this one 's a weirdy .... honestly , i ca n't tell you all the inner plot-points of the beast , cuz i started losing interest when nothing happened during the first 45 or more minutes - but just wait , it definitely does `` pick up '' ... the plot involves something about a monster in the woods that some french aristocrat chick screwed back in the day . eventually you see `` the beast '' , which looks like a guy dressed in a giant rat-bear costume with a horse cock attached to it . the scene takes place with the aristocrat woman running around the forest looking for a lost sheep . the sheep ends up dead and the woman gets scared . the beast pops up , rapes the chick and shoots 400 gallons of spunk all over her . eventually the chick starts to enjoy the beast 's `` attention '' which results in some pretty novel simulated sex scenes , including an unnervingly erotic foot masturbation scene where the woman jerks the beast off with her feet while the monster shoots more huge loads everywhere ( yeah , i 've got a twisted foot-fetish - so sue me .... ) ... the whole film is told in flashbacks and long-winded dialog scenes that tended to be a bit tedious . a `` shocking '' but predictable ending concludes this extremely strange film ... the beast is a film that i find kind of hard to rate . the cinematography itself is quite eye-catching and the sets , costumes and locations are elaborate . the plot is a little convoluted and seems to take it self awfully seriously for what ends up being such an unintentionally hilarious film about a chick boning a rat-bear . a good bit of tits , ass , and hairy 70 's french bushes to help make up for the dull first half of the film . i have to honestly say , that if it were n't for the graphic scenes of the beast spackling all over the willing maiden , this film would have been a real bore - that is unless you like dull dialog and some graphic horse sex ( the beginning has a very up-close and personal scene of two horses boning , including a pulsating and spunk covered female horse vagina ... yum ! ! ! ) . but the beast sex scene is so strange and such a refreshing change from the rest of the film , that i have to say that those scenes alone make up for what otherwise would have been a real snoozer . i have to recommend this one to anyone who thinks they 've seen it all - the beast rape really is out-there and something to be witnessed . also recommended to any fans of 70's/80 's sleaze films - this one ranks pretty high with them . worth a look for you sick rat-bear beastiality lovers out there ( like me ) ... 8/10
this is a very entertaining movie . a few of the reviews that i have read on this forum have been written by people who , apparently , think that the film was an effort at serious drama . it was not made that way .... it is an extremely enjoyable film , performed in a tongue in cheek manner . all of the actors are obviously having fun while entertaining us . the fight sequences are lively , brisk and , above all , not gratuitous . the so-called `` green death '' , utilized on a couple of occasions , is not , as i read in one review , `` gruesome '' . a couple of reviewers were very critical of the martial arts fight between doc and seas near the end of the film . hey , lighten up ... again , i remind one and all that this is a fun film . each phase of this `` fight '' was captioned , which added to the fun aspect . the actors were not trying to emulate bruce lee or jackie chan . this is not one of those martial arts films . ron ely looks great in this film and is the perfect choice to play doc . another nice touch is the unique manner in which the ultimate fate of the `` bad guy '' ( seas ) is dealt with . i promise you that if you do n't try to take this film very seriously and simply watch it for the entertainment value , you will spend 100 minutes in a most enjoyable manner .
saw this movie on its release and have treasured it since . what a wonderful group of actors ( i always find the casting one of the most interesting aspects of a film ) . really enjoyed seeing dramatic actress jacqueline bisset in this role and wallace shawn is always a hoot . the script is smart , sly and tongue-in-cheek , poking fun at almost everything `` beverley hills '' . loved paul bartel 's `` doctor '' and ray sharkey 's manservant . this was raunchy and crude , but thank god ! unless you 're a prude , i heartily recommend this movie . fyi for anyone who likes to play six degrees of kevin bacon , mary woronov & paul bartel were in `` rock & roll high school '' . mary woronov and robert beltran were in `` night of the comet '' together . they were all three in `` eating raoul '' .
those who only remember the late sir peter ustinov as hercule poirot or a professional raconteur would do well to seek out this charming piece of late '60s satire . ustinov stars as a convicted embezzler ( we first see him during his last day in gaol where he is preparing the prison governor 's tax return ) who , sensing that the future is in computers , poses ( by means of a deft piece of identity theft ) as a computer expert and sets out to infiltrate an american multinational . ustinov ( who co-wrote the script ) is on top form , as is the delightful maggie smith , here unusually cast as an accident-prone cockney-sparrow dolly bird . bob newhart also puts in an amusing performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on maggie smith . in addition , karl malden is satisfyingly sleazy as ustinov and newhart 's womanising boss . what do i particularly like about this film ? not only is it a well-thought-out 'caper movie ' but it 's also a touching little love story ; ustinov and smith are very convincing as the two misfits stumbling into love ( the whole scene involving the deck of cards is particularly effective . ) so , what is there not to like ? well , the script is no more computer-literate than most films ( that is , hardly at all ) even though it captures the feel of late '60s 'big iron ' business computing quite well . also there are a couple of small plot glitches that you 're not likely to notice until the second or third viewing , but i consider these to be minor niggles . as i said , this is a film which is well worth seeking out , and after you 've seen it once you 'll want to see it again at regular intervals .
i enjoyed this movie , and after watching it , it made me wonder just how many 'caitlin rose 's ' exist in the world.how many other girls have been subjected to this sort of sexual abuse , and torment by classmates and have been too frightened to open their mouth about it ? just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another , because as this film demonstrates , who 's right is not foremost important , its who is popular , and feared which manipulates the minds of youths , and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen.tiffani amber thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim , and brian austin green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved , and his best friend.this is the kind of film that does n't get the exposure it deserves.remarkable , and brilliant , too good to be just a film made for tv .
first things first ! this is n't an action movie although there is a lot of action in it ! i think you can compare it to american sports movies ! where a team of very bad players succeed in the unthinkable , winning a game or tournament beyond expectation ! in this case it is n't about football or baseball , but taekwondo ! in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing ! but soon we will find out that they do n't want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life ! it is nice to see them struggle and training ! i was surprised how funny this movie was ! from start till the end you will laugh your pants off ! the young korean actors are very convincing ! go see this wonderful feel good movie !
academy award winner robert redford ( best director . ordinary people 1980 ) captures the majesty of the montana wilderness and the strength of the american family in this acclaimed adaptation of norman macleans classic memoir . craig sheffer stars as the young norman , and brad pitt stars as his brother paul , an irresistible daredevil driven to challenge the world . growing up , both boys rebel against their stern minister father ( tom skerritt ) . while norman channels his rebellion into writing , paul descends a slippery path to self-destruction . also starring emily lloyd as wild-hearted jessie burns . the film won an academy award for best cinematopghaphy in 1993 .
there are too many new styles of the sitcom but the one that works best is the old fashioned way with an audience and indoor set . that 70 's show is a great example . when the show came on the air , nobody really heard of kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp much less the adolescents played wonderfully by topher grace and ashton kushton ( both of them are leaving the show this year to pursue other interests ) i wish topher would stay around because the show began about his character , eric , and his close circle of friends . ashton is already the john travolta of our time . remember when john was in love with diana hyland from eight is enough , think of ashton with demi moore . the cast of actors were never known to us which is a good thing because a celebrity cast member can spoil it . i miss mo gaffney who played don 's girlfriend joanne . i miss lisa robin kelly as the original laurie , the replacement could not match her and i am sorry about that . i liked the casting of tommy chong as the wasted but beloved father figure to steven hyde . i loved watching tanya roberts besides charlie 's angels . i loved brooke shields playing jackie 's mom . she really showed her acting talent before heading to broadway . this show has been a delight with many surprises . i hope this show lasts longer even though 2 of their cast members are leaving but i hope they do n't stay too far away too long . i wish the show 's creators , bonnie and terry turner , who also created my other favorite show , third rock from the sun , is more successful on fox than they were on nbc which sabotaged their show . the turners are not dummies and i hope they create more shows like this in the future .
we fans of ed wood tend to be an obsessive bunch in the first place , but this movie in particular has driven me to a level of fan-dom that i have never before approached ! one of the most intense thrills of non-mainstream movie adulation - at least as far as i am concerned - is the pleasure of unearthing the obscure . i remember how , as a teenager , i longed to see eddie 's `` revenge of the dead '' ( a.k.a . `` night of the ghouls '' ) , which at that time had been vaulted for a couple of decades . likewise such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as doris wishman 's `` a night to dismember '' or half the works of jesus franco ! however , recent years have seen video and dvd rendering these once unfindable treasures almost too accessible - even for those of us on the 'wrong ' ( ! ) side of the atlantic .... and then , behold , there was `` i woke up early the day i died '' - a movie that should have been so 'big ' , yet which disappeared into the ether even before fangoria printed the first fairly lengthy article on it that first whetted my appetite . the 1990s needed a hard-to-find movie though which would really be worth hunting out : and this , to be sure is it .... i do n't especially wish to add too much of a commentary on all those marvellous aspects of the film - its classy-yet-kitsch cast , its haunting yet often hallucinogenic visuals , its wondrous moments of `` pure cinema '' ( in the sense of the 1920s french cineastes ) and surrealism , or even its resoundingly memorable soundtrack - since this has all been described most eloquently by other users here . what i do wish to mention , briefly , is the pleasure that i have received also from hunting down certain obscure artefacts relating to this almost-lost-to-us-but-thankfully-not-quite movie ! i think the german video , which i picked up while in cologne on a cold crisp winter 's day , is fairly well-known to ed wood 's followers now . it is also quite common knowledge that a promotional poster for the film was released . however , there is thankfully more to be found ! ! ! firstly , there are a number of reviews available from the film 's german theatrical release - i have used several of these in my translation classes in an attempt to `` woodify '' my students ..... some of these reviews are positive eulogies to the film 's artistry and entertainment value - and most interesting of all is that most critics placed it squarely within both the american trash and european arthouse traditions . secondly , there is the score by larry groupe ' , which can be acquired from the man himself - many of the tracks exert a truly emotional pull on the listener , particularly if you are contemplating the film 's currently `` vaulted '' status and growing a little melancholy at the same time . finally - for now - i wish to mention the promo soundtrack that cinequanon put out in extremely limited numbers . beg , borrow , steal , kill or do whatever it takes if you get the chance to acquire one of these ! ! ! ! ! ! it features 14 tracks from the film , including eartha kitt 's ballad , the late darcy clay 's `` jesus i was evil '' ( two versions of which are also available on cd from new zealand , although that is another story again ! ) , the cool radio music to which christina ricci dances , and also those amazing techno drops by minty and zhv ( the latter being billy z 's very own techno band ) ..... become obsessed - let ed wood rule your life .
i saw this film with a special screening of the work of owen alik shahadah . it is so interesting where did this guy come from . now he is probably the key independent african filmmaker in the world . and i am not talking about black filmmakers i am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture . the idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of african themes , with his film 500 years later it is a african issue . but the idea does n't fit that mold . showing the artistic diversity . the film is an all african cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to . i just love the mild comedy in it . and the kora of tunde jegede is just amazing , it is really a art-house gem .
i read all of nancy drew as a preteen and collect the books as a grown-up . i loved the effect used at the end ( and a little bit at the beginning ) of the movie where line drawings in the style of the books morphed into scenes from the movie . it was a neat way of pointing out connections between situations in the movie and the books . for example , the scenes with the oriental antiques dealer were very reminiscent of many scenarios i remember from the books . i thought ned was perfectly cast , and emma roberts was a wonderful 21st century interpretation of nancy drew . ( just like the picture of betty crocker , she keeps up with the times ! )
this would have worked a lot better if it had been made as `` mitchell in malta . '' at least then we would have been spared the sight of joe don baker running around an otherwise scenic mediterranean locale clad in that ridiculous looking cowboy outfit ... not to mention acting like an old west gunslinger . mitchell being mitchell , the film would n't have suffered from a lack of gratuitous police brutality either . oh well . at least the comic comments of mike and the bots made this enjoyable fare as an episode of mst . i ca n't imagine watching it on it 's own , however .
i have complained to abc about the cancellation of six degrees . if enough people do the same then it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life ! ! just go onto the official site and the rest is simple enough . i do not understand why this show has been cancelled . what a fantastic show , cast and characters . the whole concept is gripping viewing ! i am astounded that my favourite show is over after just one series . why is this ? six degrees is phenomenal , it 's better than so many other tv programmes out there ! until i heard they were stopping it from a friend it had n't even occurred to me that this might happen .
el mar is a tough , stark , utterly brilliant , brave work of cinematic art . director agustí villaronga , with an adaptation by antoni aloy and biel mesquida of blai bonet 's novel , has created a film that traces the profound effects of war on the minds of children and how that exposure wrecks havoc on adult lives . and though the focus is on war 's heinous tattoo on children , the transference to like effects on soldiers and citizens of adult age is clear . this film becomes one of the finest anti-war documents without resorting to pamphleteering : the end result has far greater impact because of its inherent story following children 's march toward adulthood . a small group of children are shown in the spanish civil war of spain , threatened with blackouts and invasive nighttime slaughtering of citizens . ramala ( nilo mur ) , tur ( david lozano ) , julia ( sergi moreno ) , and francisca ( victoria verger ) witness the terror of the assassination of men , and the revenge that drives one of them to murder and suicide . these wide-eyed children become adults , carrying all of the psychic disease and trauma repressed in their minds . we then encounter the three who survive into adulthood where they are all confined to a tuberculosis sanitarium . ramala ( roger casamajor ) has survived as a male prostitute , protected by his 'john ' morell ( juli mira ) , and has kept his life style private . tur ( bruno bergonzini ) has become a frail sexually repressed gay male whose cover is his commitment to catholicism and the blur of delusional self-mutilation/crucifixion . francisca ( antònia torrens ) has become a nun and serves the patients in the sanitarium . the three are re-joined by their environment in the sanitarium and slowly each reveals the scars of their childhood experiences with war . tur longs for ramala 's love , ramala longs to be free from his morell , and francisca must face her own internal needs covered by her white nun 's habit . the setting of the sanitarium provides a graphic plane where the thin thread between life and death , between lust and love , and between devotion and destruction is played out . to detail more would destroy the impact of the film on the individual viewer , but suffice it to say that graphic sex and full nudity are involved ( in some of the most stunningly raw footage yet captured on film ) and the viewer should be prepared to witness every form of brutality imaginable . for this viewer these scenes are of utmost importance and director villaronga is to be applauded for his perseverance and bravery in making this story so intense . the actors , both as children and as adults , are splendid : roger cassamoor , bruno bergonzini and antònia torrens are especially fine in inordinately difficult roles . the cinematography by jaime peracaula and the haunting musical score by javier navarrete serve the director 's vision . a tough film , this , but one highly recommended to those who are unafraid to face the horrors of war and its aftermath . in spanish with english subtitles . grady harp
hardcastle and mccormick is an excellent tv show . yes , it is predictable much like the dukes of hazzard , hunter , the a-team , etc etc etc . this show is just good clean television . the relationship between hardcastle and mccormick is quite amusing . they often take jabs at each other several times an episode , which adds a great deal of humor to the show . it contains several car chases in almost every episode , but , who does n't enjoy a good car chase ? especially with the coyote ! i only wish they made clean television like this today i highly recommend this !
i 've read a lot of comments about the film and how it 's so hard for people to believe that it is a sequel to henry fool , and even though it technically is , i think that fay grim needs to be looked at as an entirely different film . just because it is the sequel does n't mean that it has to be a direct continuation of the first , and i enjoyed that so much about it . the whole point of the film was to change direction from the first , which makes sense because the movie is n't called henry fool 2 , it 's fay grim . all that aside , the film , i thought , was so well made and thought out that it actually surprised me . i was expecting to rent another nearly-released-straight-to-video film and have to endure 2 hours of bad editing and an almost hard to follow story-line ( aka parker 's last direct to video feature the oh in ohio ) but this was so surprisingly well focused that it almost does n't seem so , which i absolutely loved . there are so many nuances in the film making and writing that i crave to see in films , but never do . the cinematography was brilliant due to it 's simplicity and truly making the film seem 'grim ' throughout - in terms of setting . the writing was so well put together as well , whoever said this movie is n't as witty as henry fool needs to watch again and actually listen ; i almost ca n't even begin to explain how actually hilarious it was , and pertinent . and well , parker posey , who could complain ? the scene in which fool and jalal were talking in the dark was so captivating and emotional . and i thought the spy-ness throughout the film was just so hilarious and spot on ( in hindsight because i do agree that at times during you kind of felt lost ) . the main thing that struck me so powerfully about the film , and i believe the point of the film , was parker 's love and naivety about fool , which was so endearing and turned , yes very quickly , from denial to outright passion . the last five minutes of the film were perfect . obviously there were things that were n't excellent , but nothing is perfect ; some of the acting was poor , and at times i did think that some of the new back story and dialogue about terrorism got a little hard to follow and out of hand , but in the end you got it and did n't even mind that at the time it may have slipped from your comprehension . ( this may also have to do with goldblum 's tendency to talk extremely fast ) on the whole i would say that it was probably one of the best films i 've seen this year ; stylistically pleasing , clever and witty writing , performances that were so impressive i now have gained new respect for some of the actors , and a truly touching film , and do n't forget , a complete departure from fool . which was the point .
this film came out 12 years years ago , and was a revelation even for people who knew something of the drag scene in new york . the textbooks on drag performance say nothing of these vogueing houses . anthony slide 's 'great pretenders ' says nothing . julian fleisher 's `` the drag queens of new york : an illustrated field guide '' with its flow chart of influence that pulls together julian eltinge , minette , the warhol queens , and the 90s club scene - and postdates the film - ignores the houses completely . even laurence senelick 's `` the changing room '' - the closest thing that we have to a definitive book on drag performance rushes quickly past the film and does not give the background information that one would have expected from it . i understand from the film itself , and various articles i found on the web that this house system goes back decades . the major film performance by a house member prior to 1990 seems to be chrystal la beija in `` the queen '' , 1968 . the historical context is the biggest missing part of `` paris is burning '' . the film is valuable because it focuses on a scene otherwise being ignored . it is a valuable snapshot of life in 1989 . the unfortunate fact that venus xtravaganza was murdered during filming provides a very dramatic ending , but this is not the only film about transsexuals to include a real-life murder . as we now know , dorian corey had a mummified corpse in her literal closet , but this did not come out until three years later . of historical importance , but we still need someone to do either a book or a documentary film that provides more context .
lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane austen 's satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in provincial 18th century england . northam and paltrow are a salutory mixture as friends who must pass through jealousies and lies to discover that they love each other . good humor is a sustaining virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the accessability of the aged source material ( which has been toned down a bit in its harsh scepticism ) . i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up , and i thought it did n't rely too much on successions of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do . very good results .
sarafina was a fun movie , and some of the songs were really great . sarafina was very entertaining . i do n't normally like music things like this , but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box . the movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the soweto rioting of 1976 . it showed you things from the perspective of the students in the rioting and showed you that they were real characters . because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience , and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government , who you can not sympathise with . the singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent . the clothing of the students in sarafina is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from soweto . they made the movie actually in soweto , which is why it looks very accurate in many parts . all these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about aparthied . as viewers we must be critical of the way the history of apartheid was presented . as i said before , you become sympathetic to the students - this makes it potentially less reliable and objective . also , it changes some of the details from other accounts . in sarafina it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their classroom and shoots the students . the police and army were very aggressive at soweto , but this is probably an exaggerated event . the police and army did shoot students , but there is not evidence of them going into schools and executing people like this . the fighting was more in the streets and had looting and crime . this is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students . the movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about aparthied . the teacher was arrested for being against the government , and the mum goes to work in a white persons house . but there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist policies and laws . -by george s , chris and finlay
maybe the greatest film ever about jazz . it is jazz . the opening shot continues to haunt my reverie . lester , of course , is wonderful and out of this world . jo jones is always a delight ( see the sound of jazz as well ) . if you can , find the music ; it 's available on cd . all lovers of jazz and film noir should study this tremendous jewel . what shadows and light - what music - what a hat !
this highly underrated film is ( to me ) what good writing in a movie should be all about . kasdan takes the search for meaning in our lives and lays it out for all to see and wonder at . the movie is about the divides people create to insulate themselves from the violence and hatred and bigotry of everyday life . along the way we are asked question after question about life . davis ( steve martin with a great beard ) asks himself 'is my making a violent movie ( and by extension our enjoyment of it ) causing the violence in society ? ' claire asks `` what kind of world throws away something as precious as a human life ? ' mack is not immune as he asks 'is it possible to pass beyond the bounds of race and ( an even harder step ) finance ? these are of course not quoted from the film , but generalities . others ask their questions too , and to be honest it raises more than it answers . but that is the nature of life . we strive all our lives to find answers to questions we will never totally answer , and in certain cases have to make answers fit to our own needs and desires . as humans we thrive on questions we can not answer . some answers are real . claire and mack come to realize that even though they could take the easy road and let the state take the baby , their finding it placed the responsibility for her life in their hands . some answers are not . davis ` sees the light ' and decides not to make violent films , but the next day turns around and dismisses his epiphany as subordinate to his art . we all seek answers . this movie does not answer them for ; it simply reminds you to keep looking for the answers .
i saw this movie once in or close to its release year 36 years ago ( 1969 ) . although i can now only remember bits of it , i long to see it again . the parts i remember , rightly or wrongly , include mustard gas in the trenches and suzie kendall as a german spy , offering some bloke sexual favours in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him . the music score was especially memorable and emotion stirring in the league of gone with the wind and i would love to hear it again . there must be some commercial or copyright reason why this movie is not available . anyone know why ? i doubt its anything to do with a lack of quality or interest .
elisha cuthbert plays sue a fourteen year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to communicate with her father , until one day in the basement of her apartment she finds a secret magic elevator which takes her to back to the late 18th century were she meets two other children who have lost their father and face poverty ... i was clicking through the channels and found this .. i read the synopsis and suddenly saw elisha cuthbert ... i thought okay .... and watched the movie .. i did n't realise elisha had done films before .... 'the girl next door and 24 ' elisha provides a satisfactory performance , the plot is a little cheesy but the film works ... its amazing how this young girl went on to become the hottest babe in hollywood !
this film is one of those that has a resounding familiarity to it . it is earthy , grounded and a film that will make you think ... and smile . paul reiser and peter falk take you on a journey that you will not forget . the soundtrack is beautifully varied and fitting ; and the film itself is like a breath of fresh air . this surely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors ! finally , a piece of art that departs from the obvious love story and the frequent special affects that are seen today . never have i walked out from a movie with such deep warmth and feeling of thoughtfulness in my heart ; for it felt as if someone had just wrapped it in a fluffy fleece blanket . to see this film is to find a real treasure and delight in it .
definitely spoilers in this review ! i * * adore * * american gothic and have done since i first saw it late at night when it first aired on ch4 in the uk when i was 14 . the comparisons made to stephen king are just about right . it 's small town supernatural eeriness but with fantastic layered characters . best of all , and the reason i love it so much , is it had the guts to never be black and white ! lucas buck though lacking any conscience often works by , as he says , giving people enough rope to hang themselves with . his manipulation only works because of other people 's weak morals . caleb though generally a thoughtful , kind , insightful boy can at times show the latent dark side inherited from his father . none of the characters are wholly good or bad with even the angelic merlyn showing a wrathful side through reckless vengeance in the plague sower . not only that but having gail , the closest thing to a mother figure for caleb , not only sleep with but fall in love with lucas despite all she knows made me realise this show would just go there and not apologise for it . i 'm a huge buffy fan , but when that show tried to go really 'dark ' in later seasons it failed miserably because it lost it 's humorous side and did n't commit fully to its ideas . ag shows that you can have a morally bankrupt character right at the heart of the show , and still have a hell of laugh doing it . i ca n't even think about why it was cancelled as i 'll just get too angry at the ridiculousness of it all . so much rubbish on tv and good , original shows get kicked around and stamped on . thanks to the emergence of dvd at least i can see the show in it 's entirety ! yes some of the visuals look dated now , but the creepy strange atmosphere is provided well enough by the story lines . the actors also all give such perfect performances that it more than makes up for some odd camera work . the only reason why i think someone may not like this show is that it is n't like the x-files where there are cases to 'solve ' or lost where there 's huge unanswered questions . it 's pretty obvious from the get go that lucas buck has some kind of evil powers , and that the show is all about fighting for caleb 's soul . so this show might frustrate people looking for a purpose or an unknown 'truth ' to find . yes there are some mysterious unanswered aspects , with some such as the truth about gails parents getting resolved , but unlike lost and x-files this show is n't about trying to find out more 'facts ' about what 's going on imo . it 's all about the characters and the way they have to confront moral choices in the twisted world of trinity . personally i would just get such a kick out of seeing lucas turn every situation to his advantage . all in all the main thing i have to say is check it out . i 'm pretty certain most fantasy/horror fans will love it . also even though it got cancelled all characters have arcs and there is enough in the finale to give some small sense of closure . the only hanging thread i felt was dr matt . having him not be in the final episodes is strange . i would have done anything for a second season , but at least the full 22 episodes exist and perhaps given how brainless some tv execs appear to be i should be glad this wonderful show got made at all ! ! !
yaitate ! ! japan is a really fun show and i really like it ! it was shown in our country just recently in hero tv and abs-cbn every 5:30 . it is about azuma kazuma who is trying to fulfill his dream to make japanese bread that will represent his country . he is working in the southern toyo branch of pantasia and he is also helping his friend ( tsukino azusagawa ) along with other bakers ( like kawachi kyousuke and kanmuri shigeru ) to beat st. pierre and take control of pantasia . they fight other skillful bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different kinds of bread but also learn to cook other food . it is a really funny and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime ( like naruto , detective conan and one piece ) and famous people from real life . it is one of the best works of takashi haschiguchi and is really a must-see for people of different ages .
can not believe my eyes when read quite a bunch of other comments and reviews . as if it were a mediocre movie of some run-of-the-mill dudes . the movie is great , funny , crazy , over-the-top violent though with minimum gore , and all the way energetic to the core . loved every single bit of it . ca n't remember anything insane like this made for laughs and martial art showing off . and now the most important thing ( at least to me ) : it is computer effects free . when i watch some hollywood actors duking it out on screen in modern high-resolution and damn high-budgeted action `` fuflo '' ( a russian word that means `` bull * beep * '' ) , i understand that any * beep * child can do it - you can adjust the wires to the body , add some cute pc effects , and stuff it into the action film . here it is different . i do n't think that there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide , who can repeat the brawl that takes place at the end of the film or the `` chinese football '' play . and it is just a little hong kong cinema made for fun , not pretending to be `` star wars '' . having a dvd with english soundtrack is not a problem with this movie . it does not spoil the atmosphere to me . ca n't help mentioning a very neat theatrical play . some of you , suppose , wo n't like it . as to me - it 's amazing . have a look at the dragon 's friend who is talking in a brave manner to the criminals and all of a sudden gets a fist punch in his left side of the head . his face expression changes into something whimsical and he comes up to dragon with a baby expression . and take a look at the menacing size of his mouth - it 's nearly from one ear to the other long when he makes grimaces . this movie deserves a higher rating and a thousand comments from people all over the world . very thankful to our russian industry for the releases of classic jackie chan movies . his modern ones are much weaker in my humble opinion and do not deserve much hype . total 10 out of 10 - a legendary movie in its genre . thank you for attention .
in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time . the theme of workers v. management ( with lots of talk of unions and rights ) perhaps dates the film a bit now as it 's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that does n't stop `` white suit '' from being a show stopping classic . the plot , about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil , does n't sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy . the fabric repels dirt and can never wear out ! the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the centrepiece for several iconic images and sequences , such as guinness being able to use his indestructible thread to scale a sheer wall ! the script itself is full of dry wit - `` is he all right ? '' `` yes . '' `` pity . '' - and characterisation is first rate . i 'm always astonished by the wonderful direction in these films as well . comedies of later eras would adopt a `` point the camera at the actors and let it roll '' mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and innovations . this film is no exception . of course , it 's the cast that lifts the material to dizzying heights . alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance , with eyes that convey wonder , joy and crushing defeat whenever the story demands it . stratton is a man oblivious to everything except his work . such an insular character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable , so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as stratton tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything he 's ever worked for . joan greenwood plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual , as are befuddled cecil parker and slimy michael gough ; everybody gets laughs without even trying to . it 's comical british understatement at its finest . `` the man in the white suit '' is 81 minutes of sheer brilliance , with a great plot , great cast , sparkling wit and healthy dollops of cynicism . absolutely top notch .
vivah in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 , coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career . i am not too keen in romantic movies these days , because i see them as `` old wine in a new bottle '' and so predictable . however , i have watched this movie three times now ... and believe me it 's an awesome movie . vivah goes back to the traditional route , displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage . the movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do ( or would do ) when it comes to marriage . in that sense sooraj r. barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a well-made highly entertaining movie . several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately : * when shahid kapoor comes to see the bride ( amrita rao ) - the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family . the song 'do anjaane ajnabi ' goes well with the mood of this scene . * the first conversation between shahid and amrita , when he comes to see her - i.e . a shy shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation . also amrita 's naive nature , limited eye-contact , shy characteristics and answering softly to shahid 's questions . * the emotional breakdown of amrita and her uncle ( alok nath ) when she feeds him at shahid 's party in the form of another 's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle 's beloved niece . clearly the movie belongs to amrita rao all the way . the actress portrays the role of poonam with such conviction that you can not imagine anybody else replacing her . she looks beautiful throughout the whole movie , and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly . shahid kapoor performs brilliantly too . he delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than salman khan when it comes to acting in a sooraj r. barjatya film . in fact shahid and amrita make a cute on-screen couple , without a shadow of doubt . other characters - alok nath ( excellent ) , anupam kher ( brilliant ) , mohan joshi ( very good ) . on the whole , vivah delivers what it promised , a well made and realistic story of two families . the movie has top-notch performances , excellent story and great music to suit the film , as well as being directed by the fabulous sooraj r. barjatya . it 's a must see !
this was a great movie with a good story . my children ( 10 , 7 , 5 , and 4 ) all loved this movie , including myself . the music was also fantastic . no , the horses do not talk , but instead , the story is told by spirit . and to hear a story told by a horse 's point if view was fun . i think the title says it all , `` spirit '' . this movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends . i would have to say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie , and even got so into it , they laughed so hard , and they cheered for spirit in the end . enjoy `` spirit '' with your family and have your spirit lifted with this heartwarming story . your kids will love it . i think you will too .
i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history ... the antebellum years and the civil war in particular . i purchased it recently from a rack of previously-viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection . though not of the caliber of civil war films such as `` glory '' or `` gettysburg , '' provides a lot of history on the pre-civil war brotherhood among cadets at west point . maybe it 's the gray uniforms , the youth , or the military discipline , but i am fascinated by the story of the corps of cadets from around 1830 to the brink of the war . i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a classroom with other young men , learning how to make war , then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates ! actually , there were two classes graduated in 1861 : one class in may , the other in june . the movie makes no real mention of this , except to mention henry a. dupont , first graduate of the may class ; and george custer , last grad of the june class . the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war , but it was the result of switching back to a four-year course of study , after a few years of experimenting with a five-year course ( i think the first class had attended five years , the other for four ) . as the movie portrays , cadets were like brothers and often had nicknames for each other ... george `` fanny '' or `` autie '' custer ; alonzo `` lon '' cushing ; james `` beauty '' stuart ( for j.e.b . stuart , class of 1854 ) , etc . i say this film is `` santa fe trail '' as it should have been because that 1940 film , while enjoyable , really fudges history . cadets from several different classes are all graduating together . jeb stuart and george custer are portrayed as the best of friends and are side-by-side in stopping john brown 's 1859 insurrection at harper 's ferry . in fact , stuart and custer were never friends , but enemies during the war . they faced each other ( for the first time , i think ) at gettysburg in 1863 ( stuart was at the harper 's ferry raid , but custer was still a cadet at the point when it took place ) . `` fanny '' custer plays a role in `` class of '61 , '' though his classmate chums , dev o'neill and shelby peyton are fictional . i believe they are respectively based on partick henry o'rorke and john pelham , two people you can look up . anyway , i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid-19th century america .
`` the lion king '' is without a doubt my favorite disney movie of all time , so i figured maybe i should give the sequels a chance and i did . lion king 1 1/2 was pretty good and had it 's good laughs and fun with timon and pumba . only problem , i feel sometimes no explanations are needed because they can create plot holes and just the feeling of wanting your own explanation . well , i would highly recommend this movie for lion king fans or just a night with the family . it 's a fun flick with the same laughs and lovable characters as the first . so , hopefully , i 'll get the same with the third installment to the lion king series . sit back and just think hakuna matata ! it means no worries ! 8/10
`` gespenster '' question of to be cool in the german cinema there are not many german films in the last ten years , who have made me so interest . yes , the problem of the most german films are in this film `` gespenster '' too . he is on some places to uncooked to be good to see . special the figure of toni ( sabine timento ) is too cool . but thats is in german films always so . everybody must to learns this coolneß - is the realism in this films . thats difficult to understand . but in this case it makes some sense , because she steals and she lies - she is the kind of girl is better you never love it , because you lose it . thats not clear for the other girl nina in this film . she love her - and she would lose her . but nina lost everything . she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling . there is no way - but you must take it said herbert achterbusch for twenty years . thats so often the way it goes in german films . why ? nina ( julia hummer ) is not inside of the laws of society - the is outside - and there she have no chance . this films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside . thats one of the problems - the stupid break with conventions - the criminal fascination . throw it all away - and go nowhere ! but the actress plays this difficult part very interesting . on the other side - there the parents - who are the pendant to the two girls . the have a car - a hotel suite - the have money and live in world with music of the opera . but the film stand always in some distance to seem . there is no much explaining of them . in the center of this film , there is one scene you will never forget . the two girls got to a casting . and there they should say how they find together . in this scene toni will lying on . she said a fantastic story-has nothing to do with her . and then nina will say the truth . she said it in an introversion way . there is no exhibition in it . she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here . thats a great moment . in the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on- than toni goes away ... okay , the film will end - in the german way of coolneß - rubbish - here the circle of sadness is closing . but there was a moment - where is happening something else - and this moment was important . he is more than german coolneß - and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time !
'cry freedom ' is a movie about how far people will go to find the truth . the first half is an interesting portrayal of an unlikely friendship between activist steve biko and editor don woods ( played fanatically by dezel washington and kevin klein ) . while the second half deals with woods looking for answers on biko 's death . although most people favor the first half of the movie which focuses on the unlikely friendship between biko and woods ' . i found the second half about don woods struggle to have biko 's story be heard around the world much more interesting .
i really thought they did an * excellent * job , there was nothing wrong with it at all , i do n't know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible , it moved me to tears ( i guess it moved about everyone to tears ) but i try not to cry in a movie because it 's embarrassing but this one got me . it was sooo good ! i hope they release it on dvd because i will definitely buy a copy ! i feel like it renewed my faith and gave me a hope that i ca n't explain , it made me want to strive to be a better person , they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted , i guess . compared to that , i feel like our own trials are nothing . well , not nothing , but they hardly match what they had to go through . i loved it . who played emma ? !
when i think of return of the jedi i think epic . yeah ewoks were in there so what ? they 're an interesting add to the movie ( not to mention they are similar to the vietcong who were also able to take down a technologically advanced army with primitive acts ) . jedi is definitely more darker then the rest of the movies . emperor palpatine ( portrayed by the amazing theater actor ian mcdiarmid ) was one the best parts of the movie . palpatine is so evil and vicious , vader looks like mr. rogers compared to him . speaking of darth vader , what an amazing end to such an iconic character . vader is truly a modern day greek tragedy and i think people can now especially understand and appreciate this after revenge of the sith came out . his redemption at the end was moving and really brings a happy yet bittersweet feeling to you . the best part was of course the special effects . it 's amazing how a film from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with it 's graphics . the scenes at jabba 's palace ( leia looks amazing in that metal bikini ) and of course the epic three way battle at the end are still stunning to look at . in all jedi 's deep plot and emotional moments ( primarily between luke vader and palpatine and when luke reveals the truth to leia ) and incredible special effects is a fitting end to one of the most beloved franchises in cinema history .
i 'd waited for some years before this movie finally got released in england , but was in many ways very pleased when i finally saw it . there are a lot of great things to the film , for a start the acting . its not something i have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work . this and the constantly gripping and interesting script , with a nice sorta lovecraftian feel to it , give the film a real solid backbone . add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner . it has my favorite kind of gore too , supernatural and splattery . also , the characters of marcus , the angry bodybuilding transsexual and daisy , his mentally retarded lover/plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times , and give a far out , anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent freudian overtones . this is one of the most impressive recent horror movies , far more shocking or out there than anything hollywood can produce . my only gripe was that i wanted the ending to be darker in tone , but it still works , so on the whole i 'd really recommend this to serious horror buffs .
a true anomaly in the french cinema , this despairing work has no equivalent in the contemporary production.one would rather have to look on the side of louis malle 's `` le feu follet '' ( 1963 ) ( the fire within ) to find something not completely unlike harel 's effort.wry and cynical , having lost all his illusions , the hero , a computer scientist , has got no more reason to live.absolutely none.estranged from the human race , he seems to live his life as some kind of entomologist , studying his colleagues.one of them catches his attention : tisserand-josé garcia plays the most demeaning part of the decade-.then tisserand will become some kind of prey : all his pessimism will rub off on this poor man.the scene is the night-club climaxes the strange relationship : the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unfulfilled unless he .... well now the movie takes a more conventional turn so to speak ( clouzot 's misanthropy maybe ) but just for a while . the form is weird beyond comment there are two voices-over , one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as `` our hero '' , one for the aforementioned hero.the story takes place , now in paris , now in rouen , guy de maupassant 's town.in a scene with his shrink , the hero says the writer 's madness was only the expression of his disgust for man and he draws a parallel between his despair and maupassant 's one . this depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience.not for the very short excerpts of x-rated movies , but because after watching it , you may be feeling down in the dumps .
this is n't 'bonnie and clyde ' or 'thelma and louise ' but it is a fine road movie . it sets up its two main characters gently and easily . viewers learn the underlying tensions quickly , which is a tribute to the director . there is the young french ( and english ) speaking son who wants to do well in france , has a french girlfriend and who drinks alcohol , parties as young men do . and there is his moroccan arabic ( and french ) speaking father who devoutly follows his muslim faith , with generosity and the wisdom of elders and who rejects the new culture surrounding him ( like mobile phones ) . the film could explore very powerful politics - the odd couple drive thru the former yugoslavia , thru turkey and then thru the middle east to get to mecca . these are areas where the muslim populations have been involved in wars , repression , ethnic cleansing ; where dictators have pursued torture and summary executions to hold power and where religious communities are in constant deadly battle with each other . yet the film moves thru those places and possibilities with only hints of such agendas . the relationship between the two is key to this film , and faith , politics are the backdrop . it seems to be saying that we are all human , and need to understand and care for each other in order to manage well in this world . it certainly is n't 'natural born killers ' and is all the better for it .
what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining . `` right to die '' is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore . spoilers here : top credits also go to the dead-on performance from martin donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen . playing the character in a great `` aloof '' fashion , you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails . corbin bernsen also chews up the scenery playing a not-so-good-guy who gets his just desserts . end of spoiler . as a revenge-from-the-dead flick , `` right to die '' benefits heavily from it 's performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour .
an absurdly hilarious and strikingly human tale of the jealousies and infidelities surrounding a beetle marriage , russian animation pioneer wladyslaw starewicz 's `` mest kinematograficheskogo operatora '' ( `` the cameraman 's revenge '' , or `` the revenge of a kinematograph cameraman '' ) is a delight of early animation , brimming with highly-effective stop-motion puppetry and no shortage of imagination . mr. and mrs. beetle have a completely uneventful marriage , and both yearn for more excitement in their lives . mr. beetle 's desires can only be satisfied by the beautiful exotic dancer at the `` gay dragonfly '' night club , whom he visits whenever he takes a `` business trip '' to the city . she is the only one who understands him . a fellow admirer of this dancer , an aggressive grasshopper , is jealous that mr. beetle has stolen his lady and , as fate would have it , he is also a movie cameraman . the devious grasshopper follows mr. beetle and his acquaintance to a hotel room , where he films their exploits through the keyhole . meanwhile , mrs. beetle has , likewise , acquired a friend to add excitement to her life . he is an artist , and he brings her a painting for a present , before they both settle down on the couch for some intimacy . at that moment , however , mr. beetle returns home and witnesses the entire spectacle . as mr. beetle bashes through the front door , the artist friend clambers up the chimney , but he does n't escape without mr. beetle first venting his anger and frustration upon him . there is a certain irony in the statement that follows : `` mr. beetle is generous . he forgives his wife and takes her to a movie . '' he is generous enough to forgive her , and yet he had been equally unfaithful just minutes earlier . at this point in time , however , we still have n't forgotten the jealous movie cameraman who had been plotting his revenge , and it is no surprise when he turns out to be the projectionist for the film mr. and mrs. beetle are attending . suddenly intercut into the film they are enjoying is the footage of mr. beetle 's disloyalty , and the angry wife hits him across the head with an umbrella , before the frightened and angry husband dives through the theatre screen in search of the grasshopper . in the final scene , both mr. and mrs. beetle , now somewhat more appreciative of each other , are serving time in prison for the fire that broke out when mr. beetle sought his final revenge . we do , indeed , hope that `` the home life of the beetles will be less exciting in the future '' this film may appear to be a mere story of the comings-and-goings of a miniscule insect species , but starewicz is communicating so much more than that . this is n't a story about beetles  it is a story about us . and it 's startlingly accurate , is n't it ? !
* * * * * * * spoiler ! * * * * * * * * i saw this gr8 film a few years back , its a lovely story about a young fella who wants to drink his mothers milk at the breast but she thinks he is to old for it . he ends up lusting after another ladies breasts and ends up in competition with his brother who fancies her . throw in a jealous husband of this woman who can not get `` aroused '' and you have a cheeky yet warm story about love , friendship and lovely pairs of jugs hehe its brilliant dont be put off by sub-tit-les hehe !
this show was great , it was n't just for kids which i thought at first , it is for the whole family . the first season was mostly about the father looking after is two daughters and son , he sadly passed away in season 2 , i could believe it when i heard it . i am clad they carried on with the show as that what would really happen in really life and i need to mention the goodbye episode it was so well made , it must of be so hard for them to film this , you could tell they were real tears in theirs eyes . i am 24 year old male and this episode did make me cry me as i know how they felt as my father died when i was 13 years too just like roy . season 2 and season 3 had great comedy in there also season 3 had some of my favorites such freaky friday , secrets . i still think the show was strong enough to go on , i was disappointed that it ended , it was one the best no it was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement and it could have been the next friends . it should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday .
this is one of the best of the genre . i saw it twice about 25yrs ago and have not had another opportunity to see it again since then . it rivals the zatoichi series ( also starring katsu ) in exciting swordplay .
this unpretentious horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic . much much better than 90 % of the scream rip-offs out there ! i even hope they come up with a sequel !
finally got to see this classic tv movie on an unofficial disc recorded from an old vhs , it is a classic piece of horror . its a pity more of this neglected corner of horror in terms of official releases on dvd and vhs ... the tv horror movie . recommended for all fans of the 70 's tv movie much like trilogy of terror . those interested should get the book on the subject by david deal - television fright films of the 70 's . email me for a chance to see it ..... its fabulous to see it again . it does have it problems like many tv movies they have to be rather inventive in the effects dept and even at 70 mins it can seem to drag possibly we are all used to more modern editing but still great stuff and far better than many theatrical frights released today .
i was hooked from beginning to end . great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump , but to make you go `` what the f * ck did i just see ? '' all the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about , so i wo n't rehash what has already been said . i was telling other people about this movie days after i had seen it just because it still haunted me . i even had a bad dream after seeing it , and i am a true horror fan , not easily spooked by tripe like `` the grudge '' or even `` silent hill '' . what gave me the bad dreams was the unease i felt about what i would do if i were in that cell with those guys . what would my personal horror be ? my subconscious took me there , and it was not pleasant . that my friends is what a good horror flick does to you ! the best part of this movie is that it is subtle . it 's not about bogeymen that jump out at you , alien invasions , or tons of gore . it 's the opposite . the horror you create in your own mind . the irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it 's power over them . simply , the men ask for the one thing they desire , and they get it ... but not in the way they imagined . so on the one hand , they get what they wish for from an occult book , but may ultimately wish they had n't . sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be !
otto preminger , completing a noir cycle at twentieth century fox , reunited his `` laura '' leads for this stark , gritty detective drama . dana andrews again portrays a cop , but this time he 's hardened , cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior - `` you do n't hate hoods , you liked to beat them up ! '' . mark dixon ( andrews ) despises criminals , as his own father was a crook . he does n't want to be `` sandy dixon 's kid '' so he became a policeman , but his methods are harsh and hated . one night , investigating a murder , he unknowingly punches a suspect , ken paine ( craig stevens ) so hard that it kills him . a shaken dixon does his best to cover it up , intending to frame a hated thug , scalise ( gary merrill ) for the crime . however , the blame falls on paine 's father-in-law , jiggs taylor ( tom tully ) , whose daughter , department store model morgan taylor ( tierney ) is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes . paine had slapped his wife , enraging her father , who did show up at his son-in-law 's apartment , but not until dixon had departed with the body . with no better suspects , jiggs is arrested and charged . riddled with guilt , mark falls for morgan and offers money for an attorney . he decides to take on scalise anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death , confessing everything . in the end , he can not live with the knowledge with what he has done , and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and by morgan . despite all the tragic circumstances , morgan professes her love for mark and will wait for him . it was great to find this film on dvd , after so many years of televised obscurity . eddie mueller , a film noir historian , provides the commentary and does a good job , but i find his assertion that audiences would n't have caught the significance of the casting of the two leads , since `` laura '' had been made six years earlier . in that respect , he is mistaken because they had appeared in `` the iron curtain '' two years prior to wtse and the film was a box-office success . andrews and tierney were fabulous together , and ruth donnelly is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner martha , fanning the flames between the detective and the dame . the night cityscapes give the film an air of menace . gary merrill is great as the low-life scalise , who had a criminal past with dixon 's dad ( `` your father liked me , '' he taunts mark ) . karl malden and a young neville brand are terrific also . and tom tully is just touching and funny as morgan 's unjustly accused pop . a watchable film noir with a fantastic cast .
in northeastern of brazil , the father of the twelve years old illiterate maria ( fernanda carvalho ) sells his daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization , tadeu ( chico dias ) , to be employed as a housemaid and have a better life . however , the girl is resold to the farmer lourenço ( otávio augusto ) that deflowers her , and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience . then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in amazonas and explored his owner , the despicable saraiva ( antonio calloni ) . when maria escapes to rio de janeiro expecting a better life , she is explored by the cáften vera ( darlene glória ) . `` anjos do sol '' exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in brazil through the fate of the girl maria . last year i saw `` lilja 4-ever '' that tells an identical story in the former soviet union ; therefore this problem does exist in third world countries . director and writer rudi lagemann presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes . it is the debut of the promising fernanda carvalho , who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival . most of the prostitutes are amateurs , and it is impossible to recognize the famous darlene glória so different she is after many plastic surgeries . the bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic . my vote is ten . title ( brazil ) : `` anjos do sol '' ( `` angels of the sun '' )
coming of age movies are quite usual these days . for 1980 , `` foxes '' really gives its meaning . jodie foster plays her character straight out . ever since she did `` taxi driver '' four years earlier , she has a stronger character in this movie . she 's jeanie , a high schooler who has plenty of guts , and seems to get out of any situation she 's in . scott baio plays brad way before chachi on `` happy days '' . he 's deemed immature by the other girls . cherie currie is annie , hangs with the wrong crowd , chased by her policeman father . jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand . exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous . annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted . reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident . and one gets married to a much older man . growing up is n't easy , sometimes we got to explore life how it is . in reality , you got to be careful about the people surrounding you . for me , i was my own person , and i tend to stay that way ! great music , great plot , this movie 's a gem ! 4 out of 5 stars !
i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start - every time i even thought going to bed , something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my bedtime . this movie could have been another easy slam dunk anti-gun film , but instead they chose to examine the aftereffects of the shootings . and even better , the movie kept on with the real life - just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out , a twist comes along and changes the whole outlook of the movie . this film not only does n't follow the formula , it shows how other events often lead up to and/or affect what happens afterwards . i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti-depressant drugs more - the kids from columnbine who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started . up until recently they were dispensing the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have . it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film , having a relative who suffers from a mental illness , i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental illnesses . bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their homework on those issues . and for those who think certain things could n't happen in a hospital ( i do n't want to tell any particulars ) , you 're dead wrong on that too - i 've been there . the script was so real it was amazing . go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before it 's too late . someday they 'll thank you for it .
i loved this mini series . tara fitzgerald did an incredible job portraying helen graham , a beautiful young woman hiding , along with her young son , from a mysterious past . as an anglophile who loves romances ... this movie was just my cup of tea and i would recommend it to anyone looking to escape for a few hours into the england of the 1800 's . i also must mention that toby stephens who portrays the very magnetic gilbert markham is reason enough to watch this wonderful production .
not really a big box office draw , but i was pleasently surprised with this movie . james `` i did some things to farrah fawcett '' orr co-wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary , average guy named larry burrows who thinks his life would have been incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball game when he was 15 . but thanks to mysterious and magical bartender mike , larry gets his wish , yet soon realizes that his new life is n't exactly as he hoped it would be . i must say , this movie really impressed me . critics have given it mixed , and i must say the concept is really interesting and pulled off well . yes , it is a little standard , but packs enough funny moments , drama and excellent acting to make it really good . james belushi ( i think ) was oscar worthy for his role . jon lovitz is perfect , and linda hamilton plus renee russo shine in their roles . michael caine is perfect as the bartender . it 's just a good movie with a good lesson . if you 've never seen , i highly recommend you check
i watched fido on some movie channel and i have to say that i 've become an instant fan . the film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s , you know the wholesome decade when they danced to elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it . people were so naive back then that it 's frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here . kudos to this canadian production , the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast , including carrie anne moss , billy connolly , henry czerny and the kid . it 's a shame this film was n't a bigger hit . it deserved more recognition . it 's much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team . oh well . it 's an instant classic nonetheless .
watching the commercials for this movie , i was fairly convinced that i was going to loathe it . for one thing , it was one of those `` loosely based on the novel '' movies , which usually means that the book author saw the script , hated it , and refused to be associated with the film . worse , the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable ( ex : kid gets squirted in the face with a garden hose ... and falls over ) . so when my little brother got it into his mind that this was the `` must see '' film of the season ( of course , he thought the same thing about `` cars '' , `` over the hedge '' , `` the ant bully '' , `` monster house '' , etc , etc ) , i was admittedly less than thrilled . but once at the theater , the film won me over for a variety of reasons . first and foremost , the writers capture 'kid dialogue ' better than just about any other children 's film i 've ever seen . a prime example of this comes directly after the boys ' principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet . the boys do a lame , over-exaggerated impression of the principal lecturing them , which makes it realistic since all little kids think ( mistakenly ) that they do great mocking expressions of their adult tormentors . then one of the boys asks , `` why did he say , 'alley oop ' ? '' another boy responds , `` maybe he 's crazy ! '' and the entire group laughs uproariously . not an overly witty rejoinder , but exactly the kind of thing a young kid would come up with on the spot and exactly the type of remark other kids his age would find hilarious . as if to confirm it , my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken on-screen ; i could practically hear his voice spouting the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situation . another reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying , sibling relationships , the new kid in school , and peer pressure/conformity without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special . for example , the bully ( joe ) is n't stereotypical ; he 's definitely bad but not pure evil , and just enough of his home-life is revealed that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins . there 's also no `` cue the dramatic music '' moment where billy ( 'worm boy ' ) realizes what a complete tool he 's being to his younger brother woody , and yet , by the end of the movie , some type of minor transformation has been made . there 's some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other , and very little of it comes across as corny . the only drawback to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous mcdonald 's dance party in `` mac and me '' would scoff at . why oh why was it put into the movie ? ? did austin rogers ( adam ) pull a macaulay culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills ? the entire sequence definitely did not need to be there and had slightly less comedic value than any given show on `` the history channel '' . overall , though , this movie was excellent , and the length ( about an hour and twenty minutes ) was just about perfect . one of the best , most realistic live action kid films you 'll ever see if you 're ever around children or just remember what being a kid was actually like .
this movie captures the essence of growing up in smalltown america for a young girl on her own . the realism and subtle nuances , offered to ashley judd 's character , ruby , by the storyline , capture what can only be described as a true to life setting in the panhandle of florida . from the slam of a screen door , to the lack of work , the echoes of what life is really like on the `` red-neck riviera '' provide rough choices for the young girl . paradise did not come easy . but she slowly overcomes obstacles and deceit , and learns to be her own woman , with a strength that flows from within . ashley judd 's winning smile , and infectious gait exude warmth and command respect and admiration . the careful pace of the character development resembles that of `` ulee 's gold '' in 1997 , starring peter fonda , and also directed by victor nunez .
i have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and i would first like to say that i understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well : viewed from an israeli perspective , i can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie . what i would like to say is that 'distortion ' was shown at a film festival in geneva in november 2005 ( festival 'cinéma tout écran ' ) where it won the award of the audience ( 'prix du public'in french ) . for what affects me , i liked the 'nervous camera ' work of mr bouzaglo , who , in my opinion , portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well , and i think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie . this perspective , however , might seem totally 'alien ' to an israeli viewer , but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers , because switzerland is a country which has never been subject to any terrorist attack . it therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in geneva judged this film with a much more 'detached ' perspective.i would also like to quote what mr bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a geneva newspaper ( i 'm translating from french ) : `` after 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence , we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal.we might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living . we are like the characters in my movie , '' on the edge of the edge '' . this is the reason why the private detective , who is somehow `` voyeur '' is the happiest character in the movie , because he earns a living thanks to the system , he takes advantage of this situation '' this is , in substance , the main thing that i and the swiss public , in my opinion , pointed out in this movie , and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor . so , to sum up , different country=different perspective , but i think that this is somehow great , because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema , that is to say that it well never be subject to a 'unique ' of 'formatted ' way of thinking .
personnaly i really loved this movie , and it particularly moved me . the two main actors are giving us such great performances , that at the end , it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their characters . the alchemy between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous , and the song are just great the way they are . that 's why i did n't feel surprised when i learned it had won 5 golden globe awards ( the most rewarded movie at the golden globes ) , an oscar and even a grammy . this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone . a great movie , that has often been criticized ( maybe because streisand dared to get involved in it , surely as a `` co-director '' ) . her artistry is the biggest , and that will surely please you !
i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds . but this movie i enjoyed , mostly because i 'm used to the usual hk action films . most of the films like this are do n't watch it for the story line , watch it for the mindless action . and mindless action is right . you get to see jet li jump , spin , kick , punch , shoot , make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets . it 's true that this movie was released to a broader audience after li was in lethal weapon 4 . that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped . most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film . but you need to remember most hk film budgets are n't nearly as high as a north american film , and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually requiring in wire work in a lot of them . if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing . my rating was an 8 .
this film would usually classify as the worst movie production ever . ever . but in my opinion it is possibly the funniest . the horrifying direction and screenplay makes this film priceless . i bought the movie whilst sifting through the bargain dvd 's at my local pound shop . me and some friends then watched it , admittedly whilst rather drunk . it soon occurred that this was n't any normal film . instead a priceless relic of what will probably be james cahill 's last film . at first we were confused and were screaming for the dvd player to be turned off but thankfully in our abnormal state no-one could be bothered . instead we watched the film right through . at the end we soon realised we had found any wasters dream , something that you can acceptably laugh at for hours , whilst laughing for all the wrong reasons . we soon showed all our other friends and they too agreed , this was n't a work of abysmal film . this was a film that you can truly wet yourself laughing at . this was a film that anyone can enjoy . this was genius .
this movie is simply awesome.it was a very sensitive issue and movie was superb.this movie did not create any controversy in india ( as far as i know ) and its publicity was also kept low.initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing ... most of the indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember ashoka , mangal pandey , loc etc .. there have been so many movies in india which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added . but its treatment is pretty similar to pinjar movie ( also a must watch ) . if it counts then i would like to thank anil kapoor ( producer ) and firoz abbas khan ( the director ) for making such a great movie ..
midnight cowboy is not for everybody . it 's raw , painful , and realistic but very entertaining . the lead actors jon voight and dustin hoffman who would go on to become oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances . voight as the texas hustler , joe buck , who migrates from small town texas to new york city to become a hustler . he does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy . the new york city women like the rich lady played by georgeann johnson and cass played by oscar nominated sylvia miles are different than texas women . sadly , buck is trying to escape from his past life in texas . he was raised by his grandmother , sally buck , played by the wonderful actress ruth white who died in 1969 from cancer . the locations in new york city are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between fatso played by hoffman and buck 's characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship . the men are struggling to survive the new york city life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job . as the film evolves , buck 's past comes to the surface and it 's haunting but not clear . the film is not for children but compared to today 's films and television programming , midnight cowboy might be more tame . i ca n't forget a young brenda vaccaro and a party that you ca n't forget . it 's also a tearjerker of a film , so get your hankies out too .
this is a must see for anybody who loves thriller 's specially political thriller . one scene that stands out is milgram experiment it is shot to perfection very rarely do we get to see a movie shot and scripted the way this movie is presented . the movie starts with a kennedy like assassination and a three member team is constituted to investigate the assassination . however one of the member does not agree with the final findings of the committee . as per the terms set that member would initiate a one man investigation into the assassination . this investigation gets him involved in into to deep and dark secrets of high office politics and the way they are controlled .
delightful film directed by some of the best directors in the industry today . the film is also casting some of the great actors of our time , not just from france but from everywhere . my favorite segments : 14th arrondissement : carol ( margo martindale ) , from denver , comes to paris to learn french and also to make a sense of her life . montmartre : there was probably not a better way to start this movie than with this segment on romantic paris . loin du 16ème : an image of paris that we are better aware of since the riots in the cités . ana ( catalina sandino moreno ) spends more time taking care of somebody else 's kid ( she 's a nanny ) than of her own . quartier latin : so much fun to see gérard depardieu as the `` tenancier de bar '' with gena rowlands and ben gazzara discussing their divorce . tour eiffel : do n't tell me you did n't like those mimes ! tuileries : such a treat to see steve buscemi as the tourist who 's making high-contact ( a no- no ) with a girl in the metro . parc monceau : nick nolte is great . ludivine sagnier also . i 've spend 3 days in paris in 2004 and this movie makes me want to go back ! seen in barcelona ( another great city ) , at the verdi , on march 18th , 2007 . 84/100 ( * * * )
the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel day-lewis and hugh o'conor as christy brown , guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds . as a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy , i can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing . the enormous support that christy got form his family , low-income , working class dubliners , encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book , but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy brown 's witty arrogant personality . i do recommend this movie to everyone , especially to classic movie-lovers .
i would almost give it 10 out of 10 . however , there are some confusing parts as well as sections that are miss-leading which hurt the flow/continuity of the film . the story line is great and well composed ; you will definitely want to watch this quietly to fully understand it . the characters are complicated and so is the story line , expect to be given only enough information to stop scratching your head , it 's a film where all is explained in the end . the animation is great and the combination of femme fatal and film noir result in a great film that is unlike anything else i 've seen in animation . it is a black and white film and its quiet dark in a few scenes so it 's worth watching it on a good t.v , or plasma . the character voices do save this film in its english version , but it would have been more convincing if there were some french accents to emphasize that its happening paris , i enjoyed it more in french with english subtitles . one the whole its well worth buying on dvd or blueray if they have it ! and personally if you enjoyed this film you might also like ; waking life & ghost in a shell 2 innocence , this is just a personal suggestion .
if your idea of a thriller is car chases , explosions , and dozens of people being mowed down by gunfire , then `` house of games '' is definitely not the movie for you . if you like and appreciate psychological drama and suspense , then , by all means , see it . `` house of games '' tells the story of an esteemed psychologist and writer , dr. margaret ford ( lindsay crouse ) , who tries to help a patient and gets involved in the shadowy world of con men led by the charismatic mike ( joe mantegna ) . to say anything more about the plot would ruin the suspense . frankly , i find it hard to believe anyone who says they saw the twists coming . just like a clever con artist , this movie draws you into its web and lulls your vigilance . the story is taut and well-crafted , the dialogue smart and laconic , the acting uniformly good ( mantegna is superbly charismatic ) . some have complained that dr. ford is not a very sympathetic character , and wondered why mamet would make lindsay crouse look so physically unattractive . but dr. ford is supposed to be cold and aloof ; moreover , her homeliness is in a way essential to the plot ( at one point , i believe that an injury to her sexual self-esteem is a key part of her motivation ... i 'll say no more ) . `` house of games '' is a dark look at the underside of human nature that concludes on a note of discomforting ambiguity . it will hold your attention every second while you are watching , and stay with you for a long time afterwards .
if in the 90 's you 're adapting a book written in the 50 's , set the bloody thing in the 50 's and not the '90 's . see , 40 year old mores and values tend not to play as well , or ring as true , that far down the road . it 's a simple rule that hollywood habitually keeps violating . and that 's the problem with this film . it should have been set in the era it was written in . you 'd think that would be a no-brainer , but nooo . i 'd elaborate , but bmacv 's comment spells it out quite well . i 'll limit my commentary to rachel ward . she looks like she dieted her ass completely out of existence for this role . as a result , she looks like a crack ho ' on chemotherapy , and is about as sexy as a gay leather couch in drag . i found her `` i could die at any moment '' look quite disconcerting , and it greatly detracted from her supposed `` hotness '' and the `` sexual tension '' the film intended to create . other than that , the film was quite good ; a 7+ out of 10 .
i was very surprised with this film . i was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his `` marie '' the little girl he was separated from . the humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do . actually i was expecting `` paulie wants a cracker '' jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference . so if you wish to see a good `` animal that talks '' film check this one out , much better than dr. dolittle in my opinion . paulie also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well .
this has to be the best adaptation i have seen it 's my favourite and i think it stays very close to the book.what really makes this a must see though is the casting of the two lead actors.the wonderful timothy dalton is the best rochester i have seen on screen brooding and tragic , while zelah clarke is the perfect combination of strength , courage , shyness and gentleness as jane . the story ( as i 'm sure most people know ) is this , the young and plain jane eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800 's who advertises her services as a governess in the newspapers.she is offered the post of governess at the big mansion thornfield hall to tutor adele the young ward of the halls mysterious and respected owner mr rochester . as the months go on he falls in love with jane and puts into effect a few situations to try and see if jane is as madly in love with him as he is with her.however there is a secret still waiting to be discovered at thornfield hall and when it is it 's effects are devastating.this is a moving and well acted drama with nice locations and gorgeous costumes plus as i said earlier excellent acting especially from zelah and timothy .
this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage . straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks , shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it ca n't help but amuse and entertain . there are tanks , helicopters , machine gun battles , grenades and ice cream vans and if they are n't good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one ... danny trejo . and if you do n't know who danny trejo is then you probably wo n't like this film .
bunny comes home 'this man 's navy ' deserves more credit than it gets , a clever script by borden chase , directed by 'wild bill ' wellman , the film has just the right feel for early post ww11 euphoria and goodwill , and none of the blind terror that came into play few years later . produced in 1944 , the japanese defeated , the battle scenes a little déjà vu , tom drake 's melancholy attraction for radiant young jan clayton has solid chemistry , plays real and validates drake 's career at metro . the following year jan opened on broadway in 'carousel . ' wally beery , a little bleary-eyed , boasts to an always incredulous jimmy gleason his memories an improvement over reality , and give beery a ulysses-like shadow to play against . the navy lta ( lighter than air ) shots are authentic , photographed at tustin and lakehurst , and the p-38 squadron is out of march afb . lot 3 doubled for india , and bunny 's u-turn bunny comes home gives back to beery an authentic slice of his past , something he had wanted to believe was true then , the future we spin into again is fantastical now on a grander scale , a newly designed navy lta with launch capabilities for a reconnaissance plane how expensive , blissfully optimistic still , `` you got to believe in it , that 's the way you make things come true ''
loosely intended as a satire of d.w. griffith 's intolerance , the three ages was buster keaton 's first attempt at a full length comedy feature . the only similarities to intolerance are the opening `` book '' scene and the fact that similar stories through the ages are edited together into a complete film . keaton 's reasoning for appropriating this style was that if it did n't succeed as a feature film , it could be reduced to three two-reelers . fortunately , the three ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines i 've seen in any of keaton 's film . there is nothing unique or daring about the story lines . they are simple boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-gets-girl plots , but the period satires are riotous and set the standard for future works by mel brooks and all films of this genre . however , i do n't believe that anyone has ever topped this comedy . no one can play the lovable goof like keaton and the stunts in this film are some of his best . in addition , wallace beery 's appearance as keaton 's rival adds to this film 's appeal . anyone who thinks that comedy from the 1920 's can not be appreciated by modern audiences needs to see this movie .
this supernatural peter weir thriller is truly one of the most haunting and fascinating movies ever seen . richard chamberlain does his best performance here as the australian lawyer who defends a group of young aborigins accused of murder . as he gets closer on the case , he discovers more about the main defendant , chris , and not least about himself . chris tells him that he is a mulkurul , which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in australia thousands of years ago . at the same time , extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the last wave , the one that will drown the world . the dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience . olivia hamnett and david gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles , as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays charlie , the old aborigin who can turn into an owl . the climax and the ending do n't disappoint , in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who fall flat after a promising hour or so . however , this can not be called a pure thriller . it is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world . a masterful work by peter weir , the master of visually stunning dramas .
a film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war , when a spanish republican , sent by his soon to be overthrown government , ( charles boyer ) infiltrates himself into england looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in spain . he upsets the locals , getting convincingly beaten in one scene , and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood . notwithstanding socio-economic hierarchy , xenophobia , and world politics , this film expertly delves into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving unfaithful compatriots played by katina paxinou and peter lorre , and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by james wong howe , and manages more than once to get under your skin .
jörg buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times , even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to classify . they are artistically made , with also often deeper meaning to its themes . this movie is a perfect example of his work . it 's also really hard to label this movie . it 's not really a movie with a story to it , in a sense of having a beginning , middle and end in it . it also does n't have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings , on 7 different days . all different stories are being told with lots of class , though some of them are of course more 'interesting ' and realistic than the others . they are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story . the movie does n't feel disjointed at all . all different stories have a different feel to it and buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any words ( also typical for his style ) but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story . it helps to make this movie an effective one to watch . again , the production values all are n't too high and this might be something that might scare off some people . it however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark , disturbing and depressing themes . a buttgereit movie that i 'enjoyed ' watching . 7/10
dark angel is a cross between huxley 's brave new world and percy 's love in the ruins -- portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order , both in the worst sense of the word . once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by `` the pulse , '' it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters -- max ( the dark angel/bike messenger ) and logan ( the rich rebel ) . it seems uneven , perhaps a result of a variety of authors , but is held together by the energetic , beautiful , and charming jessica alba , who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive . i think that fox has done it again .
the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn . it 's peak years were between 1968 and 1972 . one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle , who had a small but fanatic cult of followers . she was actually able to act , unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks , and her subsequent credits proved it . and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique . gary graver , the director , was also a talent ; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre , and his skill , combined with monica gayle 's screen presence , makes sandra , the making of a woman , a pleasantly enjoyable experience . the film never drags and you wo n't have your finger pressed on the fast-forward button .
tarzan and his mate ( 1934 ) was the only tarzan movie i did n't see when i was a kid . it sounded boring . now i have seen it . i have seen the ape man ( 1932 ) about a hundred times and i keep a copy on my drive . it 's a remarkable movie . it 's almost flawless . tarzan and his mate ( 1934 ) however , falters . it 's not harmonic and it 's parts tend to live a life of there own . the parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great . big budget expensive . tarzan himself is co-starring . jane dominates . she have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy i tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead . well . she let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant . she insists tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father . forever . the thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle . stupid ? later someone founds it in the river . well it 's supposed to proof tarzan is dead . some cheap drama . the crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead tarzan convince jane that he is gone . she takes their words for granted and want to be taken away ( to england ) . stupid jane seems to have forgot how tough tarzan is , how hard he is to kill . the caravan is leaving and jane go along . again a pothole . she could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more , to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband . she could be smart . she could dive where they found the floating bracelet , check the banks for traces . she can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in liana 's . picking up traces should n't be too hard for jungle jane . she could talk to the apes , and so on . if she get home to england without have done this she would become miserable . jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down . and why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with `` i blame myself as much as you '' . a punishment for being vane perhaps ? nonsense . struggle , a hard slap and telling tarzan would be appropriate . still . this movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep . just lean back and enjoy . it 's tarzan and jane for god sake .
this is a racist movie , but worthy of study and enjoyment . first time through it the natural inclination is to focus on erbe & dad . they have a relaxed , peaceful thing going , what with her still at home about to graduate from high school , and him retired and kicking back waiting for inspiration to do something . second time through you realize how horribly the sister 's husband is dissed by her friends in the backwoods blues bar . he takes it , it 's the thing to do these days , and the critical moment passes as if they were chatting about the weather . in that same scene the sister 's blues song is a real tear-jerker if you 're the least bit sensitive and like that kind of music . her performance feels like the climax of the story ; a blues story with the good guys being `` people of color '' in their element in backwoods , sc . meanwhile , all the white folk in the movie lead what appears to be shallow meaningless lives fit only for making babies . that 's cool , long as you recognize it as fiction .
what was there about 1939 that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films ? well , whatever it was , the magic may also be found in this columbia picture . it 's a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show . ( maltin 's movie book does not contain it . ) in nearly every department , amazing mr. williams is a jewel . it 's the story of a first-rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended . as the wedding bells are about to ring , he gets called to the scene of a murder . the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force . there are a lot of laughs in the process . melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy . joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight . edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilarious . the film goes on a bit too long , but who cares ? the screwball comedies are always able to entertain , and this film belongs right in there with the best .
this film has a lot of strong points . it has one of the best horror casts outside of the lugosi-karloff-chaney circle : lionel atwill , fay wray , and dwight frye , plus leading man melvyn douglas . it 's got all the right ingredients : bats , a castle with lots of stone staircases , a mad scientist , townspeople waving torches and hunting vampires , an `` igor '' -type character , a beautiful girl , even a goofy-haired burgomeister . the soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative . there 's even some good comic relief nicely spaced throughout the script . but it 's not really a monster movie because there is nothing supernatural going on in `` kleinschloss '' ( `` little castle '' ) . the plot revolves around the generic crazy scientist ( nicely played by atwill ) who values his work more highly than human lives . it 's not top-tier material , because of a ho-hum resolution of the plot and some embarrassingly bad dialog for dwight frye . but it 's worth a look if you like early b/w horror pictures .
hi , im scott ( a.k.a woody7739 ) i love the film twisted desire , and i love watching melissa joan hart on the t.v as i think she is fine . i am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too , so this helped my watch it ( do n't ask ) . i love the way that nicole plans out her parents murder very carfully , as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles , so she wont give away her fingerprints ( a very well planned out idea ) , back i guess it all backfired on nicole as she got caught as her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt . i give this film a nine out of ten , and put it in my top 10 films list . and last but not least if anyone see 's this film in the shops please tell me as i seen it on tv and did n't record it . bye
these are excerpts from a nine-page `` memo to mr. cohn from mr. welles '' , written after orson had seen studio mogul harry cohn 's edited version of the picture ( he took an hour out ) : `` ... the preview title music was written by a first rate composer , george antheil . although not written for our picture at all , this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable ... the only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer ( heinz roemheld ) is the rather weary one of using a popular song -- the `` theme '' -- in as many arrangements as possible . throughout we have musical references to `` please do n't kiss me '' for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material . the tune is pleasing , it may do very well on the hit parade -- but lady from shanghai is not a musical comedy ... mr. roemheld is an ardent devotee of an old-fashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as `` disney '' . in other words , if somebody falls down , he makes a `` falling down '' sound in the orchestra , etc. , etc ... if the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative , i could n't be unhappier about the results ... just before i left to go abroad , i asked vi ( viola lawrence , the editor ) to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi-cab and also quite a bit of dialogue . i am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut ... saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence ( this was not done , accounting for the main weaknesses of the film 's opening reel ) ... there is nothing in the fact of rita 's diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo ... what does matter is rita 's beauty ... the evil overtones suggested by grigsby 's character , and michael 's bewilderment . any or all of these items might have inspired the music . instead , the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a silly symphony : a pratfall by pluto the pup , or a wild jump into space by donald duck ... there is no sound atmosphere on the boat . a little wind and water is sorely missed . there 's no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen ... at the start of the picnic sequence ... in the temporary score , we used a very curious , sexy latin-american strain ... this has been replaced with a corny `` dramatic '' sequel -- bad stock stuff ... this sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved lady from shanghai from being just another whodunit ... there is a big musical outburst after grigsby 's line , `` i want you to kill him . '' this is absurd ... the hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio ... was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point . as it stands now , it 's on about the same level as the rest of the scoring . nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we 're kidding ... the aquarium scene needs more echo . `` please do n't kiss me '' is in again ! ... a bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of michael 's run down the pier . from the gunshot through to the phone call , a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort . for some reason , this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo . as a result , the whole sequence seems dull ... the audience should feel at this point , along with michael , that maybe they are going crazy . the new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they 're going to sleep ... the gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music ... the closing music again makes reference to `` please do n't kiss me '' ... this finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity , and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picture . '' all of these edits from orson were ignored
it 's funny . it 's not arthur miller or t.s . elliot , but man this is funny . kline and fields are great . ( her toss-off line `` god , you are so disgusting '' as she climbs in his window - great ! kline 's running into the door after scoping out teri hatcher - great too ! ) robert downey jr. and kathy moriarty work together flawlessly - until he finds out who she really is ... a soap opera turn if there every was one ! the scene near the end in the chinese dining area had my kids and i rolling on the floor - that scene alone is worth the rental price . does n't solve any world problems or show the seemy underbelly of daytime t.v . ( i hope ) . just a lot of fun .
sometimes i just want to laugh . do n't you ? no analyzing , no critiquing and no looking for deeper meaning . rent this movie , watch it all and laugh your ass off . do n't want to admit you liked it ? fine . but do n't trash it here when you and i both know you liked it . it 's damn funny !
there is n't a whole lot going on in this story -- just two men employing very different ways of handling memories of vietnam . but what it lacks in premise , it more than makes up for in acting and realism . it 's a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience . we even get romance ( not gratuitous -- just another very real piece of this story ) . it 's well worth seeing .
visconti 's first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique , accompanied by compelling performances from massimo girotti as the handsome drifter and , best of all , clara calamai as the fabulous , frantic giovanna . remade several times as 'the postman rings twice ' but never bettered . ca n't believe this was the man 's first film ! it shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career .
this movie was directed by victor nunez who also wrote the screenplay ( ulee 's gold ) . nice and straightforward writing , that was nominated for the independent spirit award , looking at ruby 's day to day life . what we see is a slice in the life of the young woman ruby . ashley judd ( sisters ) won the independent spirit award best female lead for this role . ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity . she explores jobs , friendships , boy friends , sex , a typical young adult search . the movie won grand jury prize at the sundance film festival . as an independent film enthusiast i picked the movie because of sundance . i appreciate this type of movie , because it does not carry the hollywood baggage . although the stories are completely different this reminded me of nobody 's fool , staring paul newman . the later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man . i like that . the story is very nicely told , and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story . the only thing i am not sure about is the title . i am sure that there are not that many bugs , and flies in paradise as there are in florida . as i am allergic to mosquitos , florida is no paradise to me , i itch all over thinking about florida . i turn into a complete red boil . i recommend this movie ! favorite scenes : ruby and her friend rochelle bridges , played by allison dean walking at the beach of panama city , florida . indeed the sand is very white . i have been there . favorite quotes : `` necessity has always been a good excuse . '' `` all that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now , who is going to be and when and why . ''
so one person says , `` this movie is a beautiful , delicate exploration of west german life after world war ii . '' and the other says , `` former nazis living in bombed out buildings , and the movie is 'beautiful , delicate ' ? '' and the first sits there nodding , takes another sip of coffee . `` i ca n't explain . just see it . ''
joseph h. lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir . this is surely his best . it does n't have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir . though american-made , it is set entirely in england . it lacks gangsters . it lacks a femme fatale . it does not lack crime . the title character answers an ad . she is overjoyed that she 'll be making some money as a secretary . instead , she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot . only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal . and nina foch gives the sense of a strong woman as julia . part of the excitement comes from casting against type : ms. foch has an elegant manner . she is no screaming , cowering victim . she is actually a bit icy and patrician , albeit impecunious . this makes her character 's plight all the more believable . surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of dame may witty . she was ( and is ) probably most famous for the charming title character in `` the lady vanishes . '' she has a sweet manner and a harmless , slightly dithering manner . but here she is far from a heroine . george macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son . the whole cast , in fact , is superb . it seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident . undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing . but he did it on a low budget . that is the thrill and charm of film noir , the real film noir : it is small , convincingly lowlife , and , in this case , unforgettable .
this film is wonderful in every way that modern action adventures are not . take some time . relax , enjoy . think . people who see this movie as slow or plodding or dull really need to take a week off and watch it several times until their short attention span mind comes to grips with the possibility of being involved with a cause or even beautiful story in a beautiful place for no other reason than because it is n't hurrying to make the points you so emphatically need it to make in the short time alloted . at first i was apprehensive of brosnan playing a native american . given the story line though , i think it was apt casting . now , back to my hermiting . -jahfre
i must give how she move a near-perfect rating because the content is truly great . as a previous reviewer commented , i have no idea how this film has found itself in imdbs bottom 100 list ! that 's absolutely ridiculous ! other films -- particular those that share the dance theme -- ca n't hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of top-notch , believable acting , and amazing dance routines . from start to finish the underlying story ( this is not just about winning a competition ) is very easy to delve into , and surprisingly realistic . none of the main characters in this are 2-dimensional by any means and , by the end of the film , it 's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them . ( and , even if you 're not the crying type , you might get a little weepy-eyed before the credits roll . ) i definitely recommend this film to dance-lovers and , even more so , to those who can appreciate a poignant and well-acted storyline . how she move is n't perfect of course ( what film is ? ) , but it 's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half-baked plot and/or characters who lack substance . the actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers !
the movie was a long awaited release , which where a bit disappointing because of the expectation 's i had set up . when looking at it again i must say it is actually pretty ok. first of all is it very true to the original history ( of course not completely ) and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie . modesty 's history as a child is shown and is very true to the original . the acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin , but when you compare it to the 1966 vitti movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical . generally would i only recommend it to fans of modesty blaise or to someone who by catch it on the tv .
after the success of the second instalment , richard curtis and ben elton decided that blackadder should have a third appearance . this time instead of tudor times or elizabethan times , edmund blackadder ( bafta nominated rowan atkinson ) is living in the time of the french revolution . accompanied by the now stupid but lovable baldrick ( tony robinson ) blackadder is the `` faithful '' butler to george , the prince regent of wales ( hugh laurie ) . throughout this third series to the wonderfully written sitcom blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful . he tries electing a lord for a rotten borough , tries to sell a book , tries to win a bet about the scarlet pimpernel , tries to be a highway man and finally poses as the prince . this is a very good instalment to the popular comedy . includes appearances from robbie coltrane , tim mcinnerny , miranda richardson and stephen fry . it won the bafta for best comedy series , and it was nominated for best design and best make up . rowan atkinson was number 18 on the 50 greatest british actors , he was number 24 on the comedians ' comedian , and he was number 8 on britain 's favourite comedian , edmund blackadder was number 3 on the 100 greatest tv characters , and he was number 3 on the world 's greatest comedy characters , and blackadder ( all four series ) was number 2 on britain 's best sitcom . outstanding !
another aussie masterpiece , this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural , and it does very well . it does n't resort to the big special effects overkill like american flicks , it focuses more on emotional impact . a relatively simple plot that rebecca gibney & co. bring to life . it follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside , and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago . strange things begin to happen in the house , and john adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared , who was actually a mass murderer . highly recommended . 8/10
ah , domino is actually a breath of fresh air , something new to the cinema world . i enjoyed the movie a lot because of the intricate plot , the varied characters , and the intense camera effects . i 've seen some complain about the camera work and , in fact , according to the creators themselves , the flashy and wild shots were all the culmination of mistakes made through time . all of what you see was the desired effect . perhaps some complain because something quite like this has never been done before , although that 's what sets it apart . in a deeper aspect , what you are seeing is just how domino sees things through her eyes , think about it . when it comes to the story , i do n't see anything quite bad about it . despite it 's `` messy '' nature , according to some , it is in fact just a rapid form of storytelling . the plot really is n't all that hard to follow , if you actually focus on what 's going on . maybe it 's just me because i see movies from many different aspects such as the acting , the plot , etc . i 'm no `` interpreter '' or anything who picks movies apart , it just comes to me . with that said , i believe this is quite an excellent movie indeed , despite it 's future as a cult-classic , blockbuster , or whatever . and the characters , well there 's no doubting how varied the cast is . i believe the cast is excellent as they all do fine jobs portraying their characters effectively , that 's what makes a movie ladies and gentlemen . the characters are all very unique and a plus is that you get to witness a small piece of each one of their lives , setting them apart even further . basically , i personally loved the cast and characters . all those who bash and burn this film perhaps just do n't see it as i do , or it just does n't appeal to them . no matter , this is a great film in it 's own right , no , it 's a great film period .
this is comedy as it once was and comparing this with the two remakes , the money pit and are we done yet ? , only points out all the more how the 40 's movie makers had a flair for comedy which has since , regretfully , been lost . i was 15 when i first saw this and even at that tender age , there was much i could laugh at . now of course being familiar with adult frustrations , i see a whole lot that i missed as a youth . the three main actors ... cary grant , myrna loy , and melvyn douglas ... interacted perfectly , but the core of the movie lies in the frustrations encountered in achieving a dream . it 's never as easy and free of unseen complications as one envisions . all in all , this is a classic comedy which still stands above the attempts to remake it .
this is movie is very touching . i do n't care what people say about this movie , this is a very good movie . the performances by amitabh bachchan 's role has the dying father is great , because he wants to teach his son how to handle life in case something happens to him and akshay kumer was great in his role as the spoiled aditya thakur . the supporting role of shefali shetty who played the role of sumitra thakur was magnificent . priyanka chopra was good in her small role she had in the movie . ragpal yadav as the brain-dead servant and boman irani as the show-off father-in law have a very good connection and the comedy scene 's were hilarious . the direction is very good .
bell , book and candle was one of the great pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century , very similar to the phenoms we see today ( back in the 70 's - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this film ) . it made novak a huge star , put a nice item on jack lemon 's resume , cast new light on jimmy stewart , and gave lancaster and gingold new avenues to explore in their careers ( both went on to continue to play witches and other curious `` old bats '' , in film and television ) . along with the 40s movie i married a witch ( which helped to make veronica lake an icon ) , bell , book and candle inspired the grand film and tv fascination with all things witchy that began with bewitched and has continued through practical magic , worst witch and harry potter . what i rarely see noted is that the movie is also a rather interesting alternative xmas movie . the story takes place over the christmas holidays , and , despite the fact that it is superficially about witchcraft , actually embodies a great deal of xmas spirit ( giving , love , family , self-sacrifice , etc ) . i will always watch this movie ( have seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90 's ) particularly if it is shown around or just after the holiday season . it has style , substance , a great cast , and terrific production values . and like adam 's rib , it casually expresses ideas that were rather radical for its time , are radical even now ( in both movies the female character is guileless and powerful ) , and so always seems ahead of the times .
i watched the show 10 years ago and loved it ! ! ! am now in possession of the dvd and was watching the series , and waiting for scenes i knew were in the show ( when lucas confronts gail in his house ) and realized it was missing - all of a sudden i was watching the seduction without the lead up . then i went on line to check out all the bios of the stars and came across the comments about the shows being out of order . thank you ! ! ! ! ! but there seems to be some conflict . some comments state `` strangler number 19 then triangle 20 , when another had them around the other way . and also potato boy 5 , and dead to the world 6 , were reversed as well . can someone clarify ? ? ? ? ?
`` the notorious bettie page '' is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of america . bettie page played by gretchen mol was one of the first sex icons in america . the type of modeling bettie page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a u.s senate investigation in the 1950s . walking out of the film , all i could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s . you can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot , that the footage questioned in `` the notorious bettie page '' seems almost childlike and innocent . most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when bettie page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals . i find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today 's pornography , it was very tastefully done . to be honest , i was pretty impressed with `` the notorious bettie page , '' i found the film to be very well done and interesting . the movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in america . gretchen mol looks just like bettie page and gives a very fine performance . i also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s . my only complaint about the film was the running time , there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been . i looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the toronto film festival . also the ending was pretty tame and i was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about bettie page 's life where the film left off . those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid , the acting was great especially gretchen , and the writing was good . mary harron , who directed `` american psycho '' , which is one of my favorite films , is the director and writer of `` the notorious bettie page . '' i feel that mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like `` psycho '' , bettie page is a character study and a fine one at that . harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters . she is a very talented director who i hope will be around for many years to come . bottom line : `` the notorious bettie page '' is definitely worth a look . it 's a very interesting story that shows how far america , as well as the world , has come in terms of pornography . the film also provides a fine performance by gretchen mol who literally nails the role of bettie page on the head . and top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands . sadly , this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but i think it 's worth checking out . moviemanmenzel 's final rating for `` the notorious bettie page '' is a 8/10 . it 's an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in american history .
this film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film ! the plot is somewhat lacking , but the delightful quips are enough to make up the difference . this is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please . as a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining ; and with major stars like cary grant , myrna loy , and melvyn douglas ... how could you go wrong ? comedic dialog and timeing such as this has long been undervalued , and is very difficult to imitate . a good example of this is seen in the 1986 knockoff of this film : the money pit , with tom hanks and shelley long . despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars , the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments . achieving true comedic dialog is an art .
'stanley and iris ' show the triumph of the human spirit . for stanley , it 's the struggle to become literate and realize his potential . for iris , it 's to find the courage to love again after becoming a widow . the beauty of the movie is the dance that robert deniro and jane fonda do together , starting and stopping , before each has the skills and courage to completely trust each other and move on . in that sense it very nicely gives us a good view of how life often is , thus being credible . unlike some other reviewers i found the characters each rendered to be consistent for the whole picture . the supporting cast is also carefully chosen and they add a depth of character that the main characters get added meaning from the supporting performances . all in all an excellent movie . the best thing i take from it is hope .
this series got me into deighton 's writing and the genre when i was younger and i love this presentation of the story . i would however disagree with the above comment . from what i have read in the past , it is not holm 's performance that lead deighton to refuse to have the series released but the butchering that all three books received in the translation to the screen . a great example of this is the rewrite of the boarder crossing that ended samson 's field career . the scene is not in the book , the character who dies in the minefield was never in any of the books and the crossing in sinker was from east germany to west germany , not the polish frontier . this whole storyline is cloth . the changes in set similarly damage the integrity of the story . my perspective on holm 's performance was that he portrayed the disorientation of samson during his wife 's defection excellently and i believe comported himself well in portraying the aging field agent desperately trying to bridge the class divide . samson both pays for his father 's idealism and suffers due to its influence on his life . as clevemore comments , had he gotten himself an education he would have probably been running the department . i think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything . holm is diminutive when compared to the samson of the book - a physically impressive man capable of using his size to impose a presence .
it 's really annoying when good movies like this one go unnoticed . but i 'm glad i did not miss it . they should re-release it with a lot more publicity . i do not think they did anything to promote it . great work paxton .
i approached this film with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised . it is very well done and it beats hands down the ballroom dancing movies of recent years , especially `` strictly ballroom '' . while the music is nice and the dancing colourful , for me the movie is not about dancing . it is about the very japanese institution that gives male office workers long commutes to work and free time after work for entertainment that does not involve their families . here we have the man with the complete family and the large mortgage and a flagging zest for life . he is drawn to the attractive image of a young woman in a dance studio he passes during his commute and this leads him to try ballroom dancing . also japanese is the fact that the lecherous motives that initiated his new passion are made plain but somehow accepted , at least eventually , by family and audience . attitudes to ballroom dancing , as conveyed in the film , are definitely non-western , though the discipline and the music are clearly cultural imports to japan . the cultural contrasts are thus intriguing . even without the cultural insights , the colour , the dance and the enthusiasm of the players all make this a fun film to watch .
for starters , i did n't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet . i have not once seen it on tv before in my country , and a lot of people do not usually know about this show . it is a pity though , because this is easily the most original and clever animation i have witnessed in years . i do n't hand out 10 points a lot , but this is one show that truly deserves all 10 points . even though at first glance this might seem like a typical cartoon but keep in mind that this is not a kids-show though . when the complete story unfolds itself , you know that this is a real deep storyline , with a spiritual message . this spiritual part of the story is largely based off spirit-animals , a old indian believe that has been preserved for many years . this gives the show a original twist that you ca n't often find in animated shows . the overall design is also something very different . at times it resembles spawn a bit in terms of gritty design , and other times it takes on a more cartoony approach . i believe david feiss who also created and directed cow and chicken animated a segment in the show ( as he also drew that segment in the comic ) . if you are looking for a mind-twisting show , a show that takes on various subjects such as reality , suicide , spirituality , life , then this is something you should not miss . once you begin watching , you are probably going to watch it to the end . one minor fact may be that the show takes on less material from the comic , but this is not too annoying . the only question remains though , where is the dvd ? !
why has this not been released ? i kind of thought it must be a bit rubbish since it has n't been . how wrong can a girl be ! this film is , in a word , enthralling . you will be captivated . it holds your attention from the start and its pace never slows . the final part of the film , the `` episode '' as it were ( not giving anything away , you saw that in the trailer ) is also unmissable . you will chose a favourite , you will be shocked , you wont be able to go and make a cup of coffee because you need to find out what happens . the adrenalin rises and you cant not watch . cudos to the actors , it 's very believable . and it does n't stop there , they have a final shock for you . it also makes you question reality tv and if you would watch . and how far away from this are we , really ? endemol ( who make big brother ) made a tv show in holland last year offering a dying woman 's kidney to patients in need of a transplant . the show was revealed at the end to be a hoax , ostensibly to raise awareness of organ donation , but are we getting too close for comfort ?
twelve monkeys is an insane time-travelling , action packed movie that stars bruce willis who plays james cole , a man who is sent back in time to collect information about the devastating plague that ensues in november of 1996 . unfortunately , he is sent back too far to the year 1990 where everyone believes that he is insane . this movie is thrilling and has great acting performances from bruce willis , brad pitt and madeleine stowe . twelve monkeys is one of the greatest time travelling movies that i believe anybody can enjoy . terry gilliam has created a true masterpiece 10/10
when i saw this movie a few days ago , my eyes were completely fixed to the screen . its greatness held my attention to such an extent that i focused all of my attention on it for its entire duration . i would recommend seeing it not just to fans of anime , but to anyone who likes great movies period ( or who likes really weird stuff ) . the style of art is beautiful , the sound is perfect , and the symbolism within it is breathtaking . i 've heard complaints about the weird insertion of english text in the movie , but i think the way its done is complementary to the strange style of the movie . the self-attributed description of `` hello kitty on acid '' does n't do justice to this film of absolutely epic proportions . i 'd like to find more works by whoever made this , and see them .
heh , if i tell you to compare the dark knight with some 18-years-old comics-adapted movie rated 5.9 , will you call me crazy ? that 's just to catch your attention . everyday i meet people complaining there are no good movies , who seem to only know the recent blockbusters . it 's never a bad thing to search and explore old movies , especially those with good artistic values . dick tracy is one of those ca n't be easily outdated , in terms of technology . the negative reviews mainly complained about dt 's `` messed up '' story . but it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear , and i had no problem following it . i did n't see the comic books , yet i am not a huge us comic fan , but i appreciate the top-notch film-making and performances . maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell . but , if you see a movie casting madonna and warren beatty together , what would you expect . i had some scratches on my head , and ca n't help but wonder , did we really see the same movie ? the title role , although not as competent as it sounds , still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences . madonna was more express-less than `` breathless '' in her seductive role , but added a lot of fun to the story . al pacino was funny and prodigy to himself . apparently he 's bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles . we can see a hybrid of scarface , michael corleone , adolf hitler and robert de niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh . and many thanks to make-ups . to me it 's not bad at all . the surreal feeling really got me .
kim basinger stars as della , a housewife who has twin children ( terri and tammi-played by luke gair and erika-shaye gair ) and an abusive jerk for a husband ( kenneth ) , played by craig sheffer . the movie opens on christmas eve . kenneth is on his way home from work , driving a nice car too i might add . he is on his cellphone arguing with a business partner i would assume . when he gets home , he sees that the floor is a mess with shoes and toys spread all about . this angers him even more and he takes up with his wife , della , asking her why the house is always a mess . he pins her up against the wall . the twin 's watch from the stairs . he punches the wall , leaving a hole in it and walks away . she tends to the children , trying to comfort them . after that is all said in done , she needs to go to the mall to do some last minute shopping and because she is out of wrapping paper . she gets there and the parking lot is full because there is a lot of last minute shoppers there . while she is looking for a parking space , she notices a car taking up two spaces and this irks her . she finally finds a spot to park , makes her way over to the hoggish car and leaves a note under the wiper calling the owner a `` selfish jerk '' . then she goes in the mall to do her last minute shopping . when she finally does leave the mall , it is closing and many people have left already . not the owner of the car she left the note on however and she notices this on the way to her vehicle . she also notices that the note she left under the wiper is no longer there . odd . when she gets to her vehicle , she gets in to start it up . she notices a car coming up behind her and it blocks her from backing up . she gets out of the car only to be confronted by the owner of the car ( chuckie-played by lukas haas ) she left the note on and a posse of his thug friends . yelling ensues and a mall cop ( no , not paul blart ) makes his way over to them to see what the problem is , only to have his brains blown out of his head by chuckie . while this happens , della jumps in her vehicle , starts it and drives over the median in front of her . chuckie and his posse hop in his car and give chase . della ends up crashing her vehicle into a log pile at a housing development but she is unharmed . she manages to make it to the back of her vehicle , open up the hatchback and grab a toolbox before the thugs get there . with that , della spends the rest of the night trying to outrun and out wit the thugs armed with only the tools that she has in her toolbox as weapons . the first kill , in my opinion , is the best . the first kill that della performs anyway . the last one was probably the weakest and it should of been the best considering that this was the main bad guy she was offing . i will admit that there will be some that are put off buy the ending and i was let down a bit myself . as a whole though it was a fun flick and moves along nicely at it 's 1 hour and 20 minute run time .
mardi gras : made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but , are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another . david redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in america for up to 20 dollars . when redmon questions americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded . when he told them that they are made in china for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions , americans seemed sad , hurt , and a little remorseful but did n't really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth . when redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads . the workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and could n't believe it . this movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own . m. pitts
'presque rien ' ( 'come undone ' ) is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director sébastien lifshitz ( with the collaboration of writer stéphane bouquet - the team that gave us the later 'wild side ' ) . as we come to understand lifshitz 's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable . by allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now , time passed , time reflective , time imagined , time alone - lifshitz makes his tales more personal , involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters ' responses . it takes a bit of work to key into his method , but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film . mathieu ( handsome and gifted jérémie elkaïm ) is visiting the seaside for a holiday , a time to allow his mother ( dominique reymond ) to struggle with her undefined illness , cared for by the worldly and wise annick ( marie matheron ) and accompanied by his sister sarah ( laetitia legrix ) : their distant father has remained at home for business reasons . weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of mathieu alone , looking depressed , riding trains , speaking to someone in a little recorder . we are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action . while sunning at the beach mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him , and we can feel mathieu 's emotions quivering with confusion . the youth cédric ( stéphane rideau ) follows mathieu and his sister home , continuing the mystery of attraction . soon cédric approaches mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession . mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking , rebuffs cédric 's public approaches , but continues to seek him out for consignations . the two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship , so very necessary to understanding this story , is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes . yet as the summer wears on mathieu , a committed student , realizes that cédric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival . it becomes apparent that cédric is the dionysian partner while mathieu is the apollonian one : in a telling time in architectural ruin mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while cédric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking . mathieu is a complex person , coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non-present father , a fear of his burgeoning sexuality , and his nascent passion for cédric . their moments of joy are disrupted by cédric 's admission of infidelity and mathieu 's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways . time passes , family changes are made , and mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt . the manner in which mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace , strangely enough , in one of cédric 's past lovers pierre ( nils ohlund ) brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax . after viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful . lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion , conflicts with passion 's powers found in love , and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful . the entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative . lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film-making . in french with english subtitles . highly recommended . grady harp
i had just reached thirteen when i first saw this series and i am watching it again , on dvd , over thirty years later . the pictures over the opening credits have never left me . it has affected my view of the world and the peoples in it . my parents were with me long enough to have seen the series with me , and we always discussed the programme afterwards . it gave me a love for studying history and the highest marks i got in our school 's public exams ! sir laurence olivier 's voice and delivery is timeless and perfect . i get the feeling that the people who lived through it would feel that this is their version of the history of the second world war . i can not imagine ever getting bored looking at it . maybe an similar cold war series could now be contemplated , although who could replace sir laurence is difficult to imagine . buy it !
i remember seeing this movie when i was about 7 ; and at the time it shocked me . i had seen a violent movie before , but i never saw a movie with the consequences and reality of violence . this movie not only shows this , but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness . what this movie did and crash failed to do was to be truthful . crash tried to show how racism was bad ( and crash actually had a built-in anti asian bias ) and to come at it from a morally superior position . grand canyon came at things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually ends up on a higher ground than crash . especially when you compare the endings . the ending of crash is this supposedly neat little ending that ties everything up . while grand canyon simply ends on a quiet note , where you know nothing much will change in the character 's lives but that 's because life just goes on too , there 's no suitable ending . no matter how good ... bad you are . there is no ending of a chapter to begin another .
i only know of one other movie that could possibly compete with opening night and that 's bergman ' ; s persona . both movies are simply amazing , they have a richness of ideas hard to grasp at first sight . we have a profound meditation on the relation of art and life as one actress , myrtle gordon ( gena rowlands ) , finds herself more in touch with the character she is playing on stage than she would want to . the accidental death of one of her fans , a young girl that declares her love for myrtle and she is then hit by a car , leaves a deep mark in the actress . she starts asking herself question related to her aging that starts to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol . but that does n't help to much and myrtle is one step away from complete madness . the scene where she kill the imaginary ( or not ) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most thrilling scenes i found in a cassavets film . the movie ends with a display of genius on behalf of the director as he films a theater scene where he himself and gena rowlands improvise a scene , since myrtle comes too drunk to the opening night to perform her part accurately . this scene was filmed spontaneously , with a live audience , the laughter is genuine , the chemistry between casavates and rowlands absolutely amazing . if you liked persona or are interested in a movie that offers substantial ideas alongside great entertainment this movie will suit you just fine .
marie : you are smooth . dan : no , i 'm not smooth . i 'm dan . if you 're anything like me , smooth and single do not go together . you see someone you like , rare enough as that can be , and you want to say something but you do n't . or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you 've ever said in your life . more often then not though , you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life  a risk . you ca n't blame a guy for being a little frightened though . maybe he 's been burned hard before or maybe he 's trying to focus all his energy on his career . there are reasons , some valid , some not , and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason . you tell yourself you do n't need it or it is n't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening . any way you break it down , it 's not easy . sound familiar ? if you thought yes even just a little , then dan in real life , the new comedy from director peter hedges , is a must-see . it will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once . the dan from the title is dan burns ( steve carell ) , an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced , fulfilling and morally uplifting life . four years or so before the film opens on dan waking up to his day , he lost his wife and love of his life . after that tragedy , dan was left to raise their three daughters alone . between that and focusing on his career , finding love again was not one of dan 's priorities . and so he became more functional than feeling . removed from the power of intimacy , dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again . that is , until he meets marie ( juliette binoche ) in a book and tackle shop in connecticut on a quiet morning . they 're interaction is casual , comfortable and it catches both of them off guard . there is only one problem really . she is already seeing someone . unfortunately for all involved , that someone is dan 's brother , mitch ( dane cook ) . his entire family has come up to their parents ' country home for their yearly visit and dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with marie that morning . it only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken dan 's heart from its coma . with so many family members to deal with ( jack mahoney and dianne wiest are at the helm ) , dan in real life does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time . while the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for dan , hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract , with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film . luckily , hedges has got carell to carry the heavy burden . it is a pleasure to watch steve carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes ( despite the occasional evan almighty-sized misstep ) . he is charismatic , charming and obviously a sharp humorist . as dan , he is also self-deprecating , awkward and scared . carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona . perhaps more importantly , he is entirely relatable as dan . whether he 's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen , unable to stan d still in his anxiety , dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd . carell gives dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time . i wondered after seeing the film if i enjoyed the it as much as i did , despite its slight shortcomings ( juliette binoche  i know you might like to lighten up every now and then but i do n't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved ) , because of where i am in my life . would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film ? i ca n't say . what i can say , as someone who knows what it means to be lonely , dan in real life knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished . it also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen .
i have always been a huge james bond fanatic ! i have seen almost all of the films except for die another day , and the world is not enough . the graphic 's for everything or nothing are breathtaking ! the voice talents ......... wow ! i love pierce brosnan ! he is finally bond in a video game ! he is bond ! i enjoyed the past bond games : goldeneye , the world is not enough , agent under fire , and nightfire . this one is definitely the best ! finally , mr. brosnan , ( may i call him mr. brosnan as a sign of respect ? yes i can ! ) he was phenomenally exciting to hear in a video game ....... at long last ! duh ! i 've seen him perform with robin williams , and let me tell you , they make a great team . pierce brosnan is funny , wickedly handsome ( i mean to say wickedly in a good way , ) and just one of those actor 's who you would want to walk up to and wrap your arms around and hug , saying : `` pierce brosnan , thank you for being james bond , '' `` if it was n't for you , i would n't know who james bond is . '' he 's a great actor ! i am a huge fan of willem dafoe even though i 've seen him in a couple of movies . his role as nikolai diavalo was brilliant . ( did i spell the character 's name right ? ) lol ! ! ! ! he does a great job with an accent . sometimes i ca n't even hear an accent . i have seen willem , i mean mr. dafoe , perform in two movies : finding nemo , and spider-man with my favorite actress : kirsten dunst ! she rocks ! anyway , he never ceases to amaze . and richard kiel , wow , he 's definitely got the part of jaw 's nailed . i 've seen him in the movie 's and he 's awesome ! as a matter of fact , my grandparent 's have met mr. kiel , and i was jealous when they told me . but , kirsten dunst is at the top of my list of celebritie 's that i want to meet . john cleese was breathtaking . i have never seen a better person play as the wisecracking , and gadget creating q ! mr. cleese was hilarious ! i 've seen him work with pierce brosnan in goldeneye and tommorow never dies . he 's awesome ! john cleese 's most recent project is shrek 2 starring mike myer 's , cameron diaz , julie andrew 's and eddie murphy . ( shrek 2 is now in theatre 's ! ) good luck 007 ! oh , yeah , and as q alway 's says : `` grow up 007 ! ''
in cold blood is masterfully directed and adapted by richard brooks . however , it 's also so bent on being realistic , it 's sometimes more clinical than entertaining . recounting the brutal killing of a midwest family , author truman capote focused on minutia , wrapping himself and the reader up in the subject and subjects ! brooks departs wildly from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama . although he films on actual locations , he keeps his distance . the murderers are portrayed as depraved imbeciles , which surely they were . they 're not seen as misunderstood souls ( as in the capote book ) and the savagery of their act is horrifyingly blunt . scott wilson and robert blake are excellent as the killers as is the supporting cast , including john forsythe and paul stewart as the reporter ( the capote `` character ? '' ) the landmark photography is by the great conrad hall .
what can i say about the first film ever ? you ca n't rate this , because it 's not supposed to be entertaining . but if you have to rate it , you should give it a 10 . it is stunning to see moving images from the year 1895 . this was one of the most important movies in history . i wonder how it was to be one of the people who saw the first movie ever !
as of this writing john carpenter 's 'halloween ' is nearing it 's 30th anniversary . it has since spawned 7 sequels , a remake , a whole mess of imitations and every year around halloween when they do those 'top 10 scariest movies ' lists it 's always on there . that 's quite amazing for a film that was made on a budget of around $ 300,000 and featured a then almost completely unknown cast of up and coming young talent . i could go on and on , but the big question here is : how does the film hold up today ? and all i can say to that is , fantastically ! pros : a simple , but spooky opening credits sequence that really sets the mood . an unforgettable and goosebump-inducing score by director/co-writer john carpenter and alan howarth . great cinematography . stellar direction by carpenter who keeps the suspense high , gets some great shots , and is careful not to show too much of his villain . good performances from the then mostly unknown cast . a good sense of humor . michael myers is one scary , evil guy . a lot of eerie moments that 'll stay with you . the pace is slow , but steady and never drags . unlike most other slasher films , this one is more about suspense and terror than blood and a big body count . cons : probably not nearly as scary now as it was then . many of the goofs really stand out . final thoughts : i want to start out this section by saying this is not my favorite film in the series . i know that 's not a popular opinion , but it 's really how i feel . despite that it truly is an important film that keeps reaching new generations of film buffs . and just because it 's been remade for a new generation does n't mean it 'll be forgotten . no way , no how . my rating : 5/5
gus van sant has made some excellent films . i truly am a fan . however , i ca n't help but feel that the cerebral edge of tom robbins book `` even cowgirls get the blues '' is lost in translation to the big screen . alone , tom robbins and gus van sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent . ultimately though this one just did n't work . it was n't that the characters were n't well developed or the plot and content did n't come alive . it 's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this . we 're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and/or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author 's precision . movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience . this is what i believe happened here . i suggest reading the book !
whatever you become in your life , you must never forget that you have roots.this is the story of true facts that was made into a beautiful and moving movie ! i dare to say that this movie is well underrated.this shows us a reality of life ... the more evil surrounds you , the better person you become.trust in your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to live it happy ... without grudges , without living `` under a rock '' . the movie concept is more that interesting ... connecting the storytelling with real life events ... keeping us aware of everything .. from facts to emotions ! bless these people and make everyone happy ! see it , i recommend it to all young people.it 's not about racism it 's about how to live your life !
obviously , there was n't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production . but the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot . i mean brutal on the level of ju dou and other ( great ) chinese films . i first saw this when i was 14 years old , i ran home and begged god to forgive me for everything ...
ashanti is a very 70s sort of film ( 1979 , to be precise ) . it reminded me of the wild geese in a way ( richard burton , richard harris and roger moore on a mission in africa ) . it 's a very good film too , and i enjoyed it a lot . david ( michael caine ) is a doctor working in africa and is married to a beautiful ashanti woman called anansa ( beverley johnson ) who has trained in medicine in america and is also a doctor . while they 're doctoring , one day she is snatched by slavers working for an arabic slave trader called suleiman ( played perfectly by peter ustinov , of all people ) . the rest of the film is david trying to get her back . michael caine is a brilliant actor , of course , and plays a character who is very determined and prepared to do anything to get his wife back , but rather hopeless with a gun and action stuff . he 's helped out first by a englishman campaigning against the slave trade that no one acknowledges is going on ( rex harrison ! ) , then briefly by a helicopter pilot ( william holden ) , and then by an arab called malik ( kabir bedi ) . malik has a score to settle with suleiman ( he is very intense throughout , a very engaging character ) , and so rides off with david to find him and get anansa back - this involves a wonderful scene in which david fails miserably to get on his camel . then there 's lots of adventure . there 's also lots of morality-questioning . the progress of the story is a little predictable from this point , and there are a few liberties taken with plotting to move things along faster , but it 's all pretty forgivable . the question is , will david get to anansa before peter ustinov sells her on to omar sharif ( yes , of course omar sharif is in it ! ) ?
the story-line was rather interesting , but the characters were rather flat and at times too extreme in their thoughts/behavior . more extreme than necessary . also , i think something went wrong in the casting . john turtorro does n't really satisfy me playing a semi-autistic chess player , not to speak of the italian player . motives were n't very much outlined either .
this movie took my breath away at some points , i simply loved it ! i admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better , but hey , this is just a simple ( short ) story of a couple of guys trying to slain a dragon , there 's nothing more to it ! the overall design , atmosphere , the beautiful landscapes ... it 's all just magical ! they 've put a lot of love in this movie . character designs were great and funny . a bit tim burton-ish if you like . i can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design , displayed in a simple small , but lovely story .
some war movies succeed where others do not , and that can be judged from a variety of angles . the humanistic angle , one where you can feel the raw emotions ( the terror of being under attack , the camaraderie amongst soldiers , the arduous trials people face inside them when in combat , etc .. ) are always movies i find compelling . movies like das boot and a midnight clear are but two examples of movies that you sense a connection to the characters in the film . this film succeeds on that level as well . it speaks of `` the highest honor '' and that honor is doing the right thing . these 23 soldiers did the right thing , they had honor and it is recognized in a way wholly incompatible with western thought , but it is , to the very end , a true story of honor . unforgettable movie . based on the true story .
michael curtiz directed this 1930 very-stylish whodunit from a script by robert presnell sr. , robert n. lee and peter mine . the original novel they adapted was `` the kennel murder case '' , perhaps from a writer 's standpoint the best of the philo vance mysteries by the strange s.s. van dine . vance was a long-worded and superior detective genius , and his character being assigned to william powell probably meant the executives at warner brothers were aware of the possibility that in less-engaging hands this detective might alienate viewers . fortunately they assigned suave william powell first to the character . ; later he was played by basil rathbone , warren william , and paul lukas before being consigned to `` b '' picture status.the other question as always with warner brothers executives is why they chose vance as a character ; their penchant was to choose men who operated outside the law , with no apparent discrimination between a vicious murderer and a champion of individual rights against all comers . this film has a despicable villain who gets murdered , and a claustrophobically challenging locale inside an apartment complex . the characters are unarguably unusually well-realized , the direction rather good and unusually swift-paced ; and except for a darkish b/w look , the film avoids the comedic asides , superfluous characters and irrelevant dialogue characteristic of many early detective entries . jack okey did the good art direction . the music by berhard kaun is serviceable ; orry-kelly did the costumes . william reese provided the mostly-indoor cinematography . in the interesting cast , powell is the philo vance of his time , mostly sober-minded with just a hint of sardonic humor here and there . eugene palette is better than usual playing very straight as an admiring police partner to vance , with his very professional timing . the other actor who comes off best is handsome paul cavangh , very effective as always in what was written as a red herring part . mary astor is attractive but at this point in her career she talked a bit too fast to be as effective as she later proved . also in the cast were helen vinson as the villain 's woman , jack la rue , ralph morgan ( best known as frank morgan 's brother ) , robert barrat as the villain everyone has cause to kill , archer coe , and frank conroy as his likable brother with robert mcwade as the d.a . ; quirky and funny etiienne girardot has a delightfully witty part as the funny little forensics doctor who comes onto the crime scene . james lee as the abused chinese servant is excellent and intelligent . the story breaks into four parts . first there is shad doings at a dog show , where vance , coe and cavanagh are all showing west highland terriers . cavanagh 's dog is killed , by coe , to prevent him winning the title over his own entry . the second portion of the scene involves a leave-taking ; someone is confused enough by who has gone where , after coe parts from his girl friend , vinson , to murder his nice brother by mistake . enter vance , to find out who did in archer coe in a locked room and how , with the help of palette ; the romantic difficulties are straightened out , the chinese servant is exonerated , we find out who broke the expensive vase , who will marry whom , how archer coe was done in and why the butler did not do it -- but someone else with a good excuse did . this is a more-than-good little mystery , which skilled hungarian-born director curtiz took quite seriously . he used wipes , swift cuts , changes of camera angle and alternations between straightforward and daring camera-work to achieve variety , interest and a sustained pace . many writers , critics and experts , myself included , consider this to be the best of the vance projects , although others are estimable as well .
ah , the best and funniest movie about female football fans , only slightly better than the 1982 saga of teenage delusion set in north london ( qv ) . by the way , i just watched this on film 4 [ 2008-12-21 ] and am ruing my inability to set the pvr ) . this is easily my second favourite football movie after `` mike bassett : england manager '' , but this time with the added twist of looking like a guerrilla piece of movie-making from a team who apparently keep making movies which are banned in the country in which they are made ( just think about the bit where the girls are taken from the stadium just as the sun is setting : fast reactions all round ) . it is rare for a movie to make me laugh out loud , but when the rural soldier escorted one of the girls into the lavvies while forcing her to wear an inpromptu mask made from a poster of ali daei , i could n't stop waking the others in the house with my snorts , especially when the young soldier misunderstood the grandfather 's calls for assistance ... speaking of the toilets , i just wish i could speak farsi so that i could work out the writing on the toilet walls ( yes , there were a few scribblings in roman script , but they mostly referred to wanky american rock bands ) . also , on the rural-and-farsi theme , do n't you reckon that omid djalili sounds like a yokel when he talks farsi ? listen to the custody sergeant in this movie and then go `` yup . '' i 'm not going to bore on about the sexual politics of iran , and i 'm not going to bore on about the dubious acting ; my love for this movie comes from the script and the editing : top notch stuff . here 's a list of my top favourite football movies : 1 . mike bassett , england manager 2 . offside 3 . those glory glory days 4 . a shot at glory 5 . the arsenal stadium mystery
saw this in preview- great movie- wonderful characterizations- witty and intelligent dialog- actors were fantastic- peter falk will be up for an oscar- paul reiser was charming- photography was marvelous reiser was at the theater when we saw the film , and he gave a vivid account about the making of the film- it had been a long dream of his to write a semi-autobiographical account of relationships between sons and fathers , and more specifically between him and his father- this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion- the supporting cast was well chosen and gave the film a feeling of family- i recommend this film to anyone who is longing to see intelligent drama and wonderful performances
the finnish version of robert altman 's `` short cuts '' , set in the small rural town of äänekoski . the episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events , problems and emotions of human life : joy and love , deception and disillusionment , hopelessness and death . i was particularly impressed by two episodes . the first is the story of the young waitress , who tries to stir up a romance for his co-workers : she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life . the other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity . particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the `` routines '' of the hospital crew ( despite the signs of occasional empathy ) . compared with altman 's classic , this movie is perhaps less professional , but it is definitely a great piece of art .
the story of cinderella is one of my favorites from charles perrault , with sleeping beauty which was also made into a disney film in 1959 ; this film is a sweet , enchanting masterpiece from disney . the film has a great soundtrack ; that 's one i like in a movie is a very good soundtrack , and i love the songs too ; my favorite song is the romantic `` so this is love . '' i love the mice from the film too , they are cute . my favorite scene is the scene after the narration , the little birds tried to wake cinderella up in the morning ; i also love it when cinderella 's animal friends ( the mice and birds ) fix up cinderella 's birth-mother 's dress , so she could go to the ball ... until drizella & anastasia tore it to bits , the b * * * * es !
the trailer for this movie did n't do the movie justice . and while the movie did n't know what it really wanted to get across , the first half of the movie being a light , romance comedy and the second have a more serious , romantic drama , the overall impact was much better than i thought it would be . this movie was more of a date movie , but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be . kidman , being one of my favorites , of course i 'm biased , but this movie proved to be a light , sensitive , if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better . three out of four stars . 9/5/02 .
though not seen in too many films prior , you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since . not one of grant 's nor loy 's best films , they make an outstanding effort together . after all , with that much talent and very good supporting cast , you know the laughs will be there . the film is light , has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through . a great example of classic american film fare that has stood the test of time . definite saturday afternoon fare , heavy on the popcorn .
when i first saw this film , in london , in 1958 , i was bowled over . i had never seen a film like this before . it had a strange , hypnotic effect , quite unlike the films that i had seen previously and it left a lasting impact . i believe that odile versios & marina vlady are sisters , if not twins . certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer . if this has been converted to dvd - in region 2 format - and in the original french language , i would love to hear about it & where it can be purchased .
`` jake speed '' is a fine movie with a wonderful message . it has its flaws of course . at times it 's a little slow . it introduces its villain too far into the story . it 's action is paced at the rate of a snail 's heartbeat . it has a z-grade cast ( although i 've always admired the work of karen kopins , who has the straight-laced good looks of sandra bullock ) . but with all this going against it , `` jake speed '' really is inspiring , thanks to a charming script by wayne crawford ( who plays the title role ) and andrew lane . why do i find it so inspiring ? because it says to me `` hey , why not try to be a good person . '' the story is essentially a `` stranger in a strange land '' premise , that is good-and-heroic jake speed is placed in the real world where bad things happen to good people . jake is more than a boy scout . he 's more than a knight in shining armor . jake speed is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty , mean and evil world . it 's because of this that `` jake speed '' really needed to be a hit . it has a great message that should have gotten out to hollywood and then to the rest of the world . imagine a movie industry that really pushed itself to portray good and decent people . i 'm not saying that we should be watching the waltons in every theater at the cineplex , but that it would be nice if more movies such as `` jake speed '' would get a chance . ( `` due south , '' a tv show about a canadian mountie , is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten up american entertainment . ) sure , `` jake speed '' has violence , blood and guns , but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person , you 'll beat the forces of evil every time . 10/14/99
riff randell is a wildly , obsessed fan of the rock group ; the ramones and so are most of the students in the school . but a new tyrant of a principal , ms. togar thinks rock 'n ' roll is a bad influence on the students , especially the music from the ramones . so , when riff finds out they 're performing in town , she skips class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends . but when ms. togar discovers why she really took those days off she confiscates the tickets . while , this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff , but riff 's friend kate rambeau feels the same way about tom . but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe ramone and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song . fun ! fun ! fun ! yep , that 's right 'rock n roll high school ' does n't drift away from it main focus a boisterously , daggy romp ! it was n't what i was expecting , that 's for sure . everyone participating in this dandy project looks like they 're having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit , which makes it a priceless experience . that 's not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be . but watching this passionately , crazy ride that escalates into some good harmless high jinks , i just could n't wipe the grin off my face . it 's tacky , very cheesy , densely chaotic , but damn it 's funky-dory ! this low-budget , b-grade feature from producer roger corman and john dante who was co-writer ( and plus he co-directed some scenes when director allan arkush was hospitalised on the last day shoot ) . is basically a glorious homage on the rocking 1950s flicks by sticking with the fruitful clichés and throwing into the stew the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults ( who always know best ) . these features might not be particularly fresh , but they do rack up some appeal because of the dynamically , gusto treatment . the film has just one thing on mind , to go out on a bang ! and they manage to do that . courtesy of 'the ramones ' , who play themselves . really , you could say its one big trendy video clip , since it 's all about the ramones well , most of it anyway . i see a lot flack towards the ramones ' acting ability . these are musicians not actors , which means it 's not about their acting here , it 's the music we 're suppose to dig . they 're here to perform ! which , they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that peppered the film to create a totally upbeat vibe . especially , their flamboyant concert performances . the buzzing soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as devo , the velvet underground , mc5 , fleetwood mack , eddie and the hot rods and alice cooper . but these jumping tracks fitted in well with the carefree feel and even the score was worked in rather well . especially in the scenes involving ms. togar with the score grasping the right mood that surrounds her mind set . the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a racy pace between the electrifying tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to it 's sometimes clever , tongue-in-cheek dialogue . thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags , which i found very pleasurable and it gave it such a wider range to express itself . what else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine pj soles ( better known for her performance in halloween ) , who gave such a bang up performance as the peachy riff randell . other exemplary performances were dey young , as the extremely cute kate rambeau , vincent van patten as the gawky tom roberts and the go to man eaglebauer who 's stupendously played by clint howard . also some top drawer corman regulars pop up with great send up performances by mary woronov who 's excellent as the demanding ms. togar who 's pushing her unfair reign on the students , paul bartel as mr. mcgree and a small support role from dick millar towards the end . the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy , but that goes down well with the material and there 's a certain likability stemming from these characters , but we totally despise ms. togar and her hall monitor goons . there 's no beating around the bush here when i say 'rock 'n ' roll high school ' is an intoxicating hoot , of a rad time !
both my friend and i thought this movie was well done . we expected a light hearted comedy but got a full blown action movie with comic thrusts . we both thought that this movie may have not done so well at the box office as the previews lead us to believe it was a comedy . i was impressed with the supporting actors and of course dave morse always puts in a terrific acting job . most of the supporting cast are veterans not first timers and they were solid . we both felt that the writing and direction were first rate and made comments to each other about buying this movie . if you do n't buy rent it for a good time .
as this movie is completely in swiss dialect , it 's probably hard for most german speakers to really follow this movie . i 'm not from switzerland , but i worked there for some years , so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings . i 've seen a lot of movies of this kind ( eg . scary movie , loads of scifi spoofs etc . ) but this one is the best one of that kind , i 've seen so far . i give a 9 of 10 . the only reason i ca n't give a 10 is , because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd , so there 's almost no chance for non-swiss to understand .
this movie is a perfect portrayal of the nutcracker ; the dancing is wonderful , the scenery in the background was excellent , and i loved that floating bed . oh , and the costumes ... i particularly loved marzipan 's , the tutu was adorable . the special effects were very well done ( e.g . the tree , the bed , etc . ) , and i quite enjoyed the rats . i love how they did n't make them scary , but cute and huggable . except for the king , i suppose . if you 're a thoroughly masculine person , you wo n't enjoy this , but this is a very good movie that 's good for all ages - just not all levels of testosterone . but i have a few complaints . firstly , why did they have to put the sugar plum fairy 's partner in those terrible tights ? it would barely make a difference if he was butt naked ! and secondly .. why on earth did they have to make culkin 's outfit pink ?
for a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and trey parker and matt stone 's comic timing is perfect . there are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie . i especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes . robert stacks unsolved mysteries spoof is also very amusing .
for whoever play games video games here did anybody notice that the gta : vice city mansion inside the game and some other things including weapons from the movie that are connected to this movie and this movie inspired the makers of the game ( rockstar games ) to copy some things from this movie and by the way this is one of the best 80 's movies out there i recommend this for anybody who still did n't see it 10/10 no questions asked
i have read modesty blaise for several years now , collecting numbers of the strip . after the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book `` modesty blaise '' i was surprised the result got this good . what i got was a movie not based on action or violence . the director had focused on history and psychology . how was modesty created based on the own tale and what parts in her life was affected by her non-childhood . i think this thougths will give a greater understanding to the next ( i hope ) film . i simply loved the movies old-fashioned style . however everything was n't that good , the gambling was n't that good . almost boring and unreal . the acting could have been improved too . i 'm not thinking the bad guy in this movie felt real , the only reason he was there was so modesty could have someone to tell her story for . also they could have expanded the movie , showing more about when she builds up `` the network '' but i 'll guess thats for the next movie . and please forgive me for my bad english
i still wonder why i watched this movie . admittedly , before i viewed this film , i knew practicly nothing about the beatles . i did n't even know all their names ! all i knew was that they had a ton of fans , they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever , they broke up , john married yoko ono , and john was murdered . also , vh1 is n't even my favorite music station , mtv is . still , for some reason or another i decided to watch it , not expecting much . surprisingly , i enjoyed it very much ! the dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up . this is very important , because john and paul talking is pretty much the whole film , allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities , and to keep you watching . jared harris and adien quinn give good performaces , overall . the ending was also very smart . i enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the snl performace , and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go , and end it on a good note . my favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene . overall , i recommend this film to almost everyone . it is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up paul just showed up on john 's doorstep . which is probably the main reason of my viewing this film , settling my curiosity on who the beatles really were and what could have happened to them after the breakup .
errol flynn is `` gentleman jim '' in this 1942 film about boxer jim corbett , known as the man who beat john l. sullivan . directed with a light hand by flynn 's good friend , raoul walsh , the film also stars alexis smith , jack carson , alan hale sr. , william frawley and ward bond . flynn plays an ambitious , egotistical young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive olympic club in san francisco in the late 1800s . though good-natured , the fact that he is a `` shanty irishman '' and a social climber builds resentment in olympic club members ; most of them ca n't wait to see him lose a fight , and they bet against him . despite this , he rises to fame , even working as an actor . finally he gets the chance he 's been waiting for , a match with the world champion , john l. sullivan ( ward bond ) . sullivan demands a $ 10,000 deposit to insure that corbett will appear to fight for the $ 25,000 purse . corbett and his manager ( frawley ) despair of getting the money . however , help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual . this is a very entertaining film , and jim corbett is an excellent role for flynn , who himself was a professional fighter at one time . he has the requisite charm , good looks and athleticism for the role . alexis smith plays victoria ware , his romantic interest who insists that she hates him . in real life , she does n't seem to have existed ; corbett was married to olive lake morris from 1886 to 1895 . the focus of the film is on corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing . corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is thought of as the man who made prizefighting an art form . in the film , corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents ; it is believed that he wore down john l. sullivan this way . good film to catch flynn at the height of his too-short time as a superstar .
it 's hard for me to criticize anything that mitzi kapture does . she just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress . that notwithstanding , yes , the plot was predictable . i think perhaps if jill had slept with richard then it may have made him a little crazier than he already was , which would have added more to the suspense . it would have also been nice to see jill and her husband find out about richard 's little problem with his ex-wife , maybe a bit more back story . i was a little disappointed with the ending of the movie . i would have liked to have seen more closure with zack 's death and possibly closure with her husband . i do have to say though , i will never be able to look at a flare gun and not picture her standing there . it was a very fitting end for richard . of course , mitzi rocked ! i am so looking forward to her future projects .
has anyone been able to buy this movie ? my uncle `` hutch '' was a real ( not reel ) pilot who is seen tossing his wings in the air and then snatching them with his fist as he was awarded his pilot 's wings . he 's only on screen a few seconds but my family would love to have the movie . he was killed in a dogfight over italy , he was only 24 at the time . do we know the film studio that made it ? or has anyone seen it at a video store , like blockbuster ? i wish they would make entire catalogs of these old movies available as it is so cheap to make dvd 's these days . please email me at nfny40 @ yahoo.com if you know where i can buy a copy . thank you .
a comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little british effort `` the divorce of lady x ( 1938 ) '' . it marks the first pairing of laurence olivier and merle oberon , before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century english moors . and while olivier and oberon are not particularly well-suited to screwball comedy , it all flows along nicely . oberon is leslie , a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer logan 's ( olivier ) hotel suite by way of a nasty english fog preventing travel . she does everything possible to irritate him -- but , in the crazy way films go , he falls for her . and she falls for him . but a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when oberon 's `` lady x '' ( that 's all she leaves oliver in a note ) is thought by olivier to be a married woman . to make matters worse , and more amusing , lord mere ( ralph richardson ) goes to olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear larry thinks must be oberon ! there is some nice battle-of-the-sexes dialogue , and fun exploration of sexual politics . you can see that olivier is not too confident with the comedy , but in true olivier he 's a consummate professional , and delivers . and he handles the screwball twists and turns , maybe not with ease , but with gusto . oberon was no great shakes as an actress , but she was usually competent enough , and despite their reputed off-screen dislike of her , worked well with olivier . this was filmed in early technicolour that looks very primitive today ( everyone looks even whiter than michael jackson ) , but perhaps the print needs cleaning up .
other than susan hayward 's wooden delivery throughout this film it was as good as any biblical film made . henry king handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes , and peck is , as always , impeccable . the stirring alfred newman sound score , with the stirring twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years . the scene with goliath is a bit on the hokey side , but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made . this goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day , `` the song of ruth '' and `` esther and the king . '' it is worth watching , and raymond massy is excellent as the prophet nathan . the film is rounded out by the always fine james robertson justice as abishai and jayne meadows as michol , david 's estranged first wife .
this is an absurdist dark comedy from belgium . shot perfectly in crisp black and white , benoît poelvoorde ( man bites dog ) is on fine form as roger , the angry , obsessive father of a family in a small , sullen belgian mining town . roger is a photographer who , along with his young daughter luise , visits road accidents to take photos . he is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to break a record - and he decides that his son , michel , must attempt to break the record of perpetually walking through a door - he even hires an overweight coach to train him . michel dresses as elvis and has a spot on a radio show called 'cinema lies ' , where he describes mistakes in films . luise is friendly with near neighbour felix , a pigeon fancier . roger is a callous figure as he pushes michel right over the limit during the record attempt , which almost results in his death . interspersed throughout the film are magritte-like surreal images . it 's undeniably charming and well worth your time .
this game was really great and quite a challenge . it has a great , spooky story line and the graphics are also very good . i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish . the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me . a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up fans . >
this movie is finally out on dvd in italy ( completely restored ) . i have seen this movie so many times and i find it even actual these days ( 2003 ) when italy suffers again from a sort of brainwashing dictatorship ( or the us for that matter ) . i am glad there are outcasts as the one played by mastroianni in this movie who can sing out of tune ; maybe they can teach the sophia lorens of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognised as human beings . back to the movie : as most people here already mentioned the acting is wonderful but the audio background is astonishing . i must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you do n't understand the italian language but i can assure you that the show-off of machism , the distortion of reality in that ever-present radio-chronicle of the hitler visit to rome can really make you shiver ! a masterpiece !
sometimes it takes a film-making master like kubrick to bring that extra little something , that unique , untractable and elusive ingredient that transforms a great movie or a great script into a masterpiece , one for the ages . it 's not just that stephen king 's story has enough meat and potatoes making it difficult for even the most workmanlike of directors to miss . heck , even king himself did n't fare so bad . it 's how kubrick perceives king 's universe , how he transforms the page into screen time , that renders the shining both a visual feast and a compacted masterclass in directing . kubrick 's miss-en-scene is , as usually , terrific . the movie progresses with a brisk , sharp , lively pace , even though it 's neither fast nor heavily edited and it clocks at no less than 160 minutes . the camera prowls through the lavish corridors of the overlook hotel like it is some kind of mystic labyrinth rife for exploration , linear tracking shots exposing the impeccably decorated interiors in all their grandeur . there 's a symmetry and geometrical approach in how kubrick perceives space that reminds me very much of how japanese directors worked in the sixties . as if what is depicted is inconsequential to how all the different elements are balanced inside the frame . certain images definitely stand out . the first shot of jack 's typewriter , accompanied off screen from the thumps of a ball , like drums of doom coming from some other floor or produced by the typewriter itself as though it is an instrument of doom all by itself , later on proving to be nothing short of just that . a red river flowing through the hotel 's elevators in slow motion . jack hitting the door with the axe , the camera moving along with him , tracking the action as it happens instead of remaining static , as though it 's the camera piercing through the door and not the axe . the ultra fast zoom in the kid 's face thrusting us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his pov . and of course , the bathroom scene . much has been said of jack nicholson 's obtrusive overacting . his mad is not entirely successful , because , well , he 's jack nicholson . the guy looks half-mad anyway . playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself . shelley duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices kubrick ever had . coming from a streak of fantastic performances for robert altman in the seventies ( 3 women , thieves like us , nashville ) , she brings to her character the right amounts of fragility and emotional distress . a terrific and very underrated actress .
this is truly one from the `` golden age '' of hollywood , the kind they do not make anymore . it is an unique , fun movie that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next . all the actors are perfectly cast and they are all great supporting actors . this is the first movie i saw with ronald colman in it and i have been a fan of his ever since . reginald gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine and adds a certain quality to every movie he is in . while he played a different kind of character here , he still added something to the movie that another actor cast in this character would not have added .
i first saw the trailer for frailty on yahoo movies way back in the day , after hearing stephen king praise it to high heaven . not really a fan of either star , i still wanted to see it because i 'm a huge thriller fan . i was not disappointed . the acting was superb , especially from the two young boys . usually i loathe child actors , but young adam and young fenton were excellent . bill paxton really did a good job of directing it too . it was beautifully shot . one must also note the plot twists . the three twists at the end hit hard and fast , and i did n't see them coming . the final twist of the film , coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed , gives me chills to this day , even though i 've re-watched the film so many times . a true gem .
it is a rare occasion when i want to see a movie again . `` the amati girls '' is such a movie . in old time movie theaters i would have stayed put for more showings . was this story autobiographical for the writer/director ? it has the aura of reality . the all star cast present their characters believably and with tenderness . who would not want mercedes ruehl as an older sister ? i have loved her work since `` for roseanna '' . with most movies , one suspends belief because we know that it is the work of actors , producers , directors , sound technicians , etc . it was hard to suspend such belief in `` the amati girls '' . one feels such a part of this family ! how i wanted to come to the defense of dolores when her family is stifling her emotional life . and wanted to cheer lee grant as she levels criticism at cloris leachman 's hair color . the humor throughout is not belly laugh humor , but instead has a feel-good quality that satisfies far more than pratfalls and such . the love that is portrayed in this cinema family is to be emulated and cherished . it is no coincidence that the family name , amati , translated from the italian means 'the loved ones ' .
forbidden planet is one of the best examples of hollywood sf films . its influence was felt for more than a decade . however , certain elements relating to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a mid-fifties audience that is now gone have dated it quite a bit , and the film 's sometimes sluggish pacing does n't help . but , the story 's compelling central idea involving the ancient , extinct krell civilization and `` monsters from the id '' has n't lost its appeal and continue to make this film a relevant `` must see '' movie . what i 'm mostly interested in saying here is that the current dvd for this movie is terrible . the movie has never really looked that good on home video and it 's elements are in dire need of restoration . i hope that will happen soon and we get a special edition of this sf classic .
i enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter i had never heard of before . so i set out exploring her life and work afterwards . as could be expected , i found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate . i was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy . come on , guys , a film is n't and should n't be a biography ( nor a novel ! ) . any historical film distorts reality , because it should be a work of art in its own right . a film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own . artemisia is a wonderful film and i think it brought many people ( including some that now give negative comments ) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist .
i have n't read this book , but all through the movie i was awestruck with only one thought in my head : this is so vonnegut . i have never seen an author , all of the intelligence and life behind the workings of a novel , translated so well to film . this movie had the same complexities found in vonnegut 's novels : the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic , and the dramatic events and symbols were often also jokes . campbell was also a very vonnegut character , portrayed perfectly by nick nolte . he had all of the earmarks of a vonnegut `` hero '' : lack of concern for political boundaries , ironic dark humor giving way to dumb inactivity in response to stress , and an unwillingness to push his version of reality on those around him . overall , i was constantly surprised and impressed as i watched this movie . it was the same feeling i had reading `` cat 's cradle , '' my first vonnegut novel , as if the most perfectly oddball thing that could happen , he thought of that , and he made it real and important . yes , he has nothing but army surplus `` white christmas '' albums . so it goes !
this movie is a great way for the series to finally end . peter ( the boy from puppet master iii ) is all grown up and is now the puppet master . well , this girl comes to destroy the puppets and learn toulon 's secrets but instead she listens to the story about the puppets . most of this movie is footage from puppet master ii , puppet master iii , puppet master 4 , puppet master 5 , curse of the puppet master , and retro puppet master ( sorry ... but i guess paramount would n't let them use scenes from 1 ) . personally i wish puppet master vs . demonic toys would finally be made but the way this movie ends they basically say `` this is the final movie in the series ... ''
pegg has had a few hits in the past few years , starting with `` shaun of the dead '' in 2004 , movie on to `` hot fuzz 2007 '' , early 2008 he came out with `` run fat boy run '' and now comes this , `` how to lose friends and alienate people '' which is in many ways one of my favourite comedy 's of the year . the film is about sidney yound , a man who writes a failing magazine who makes fun of celebrity 's mostly because he is not one of them . anyway , one of the most successful magazine owners ( played by jeff bridges ) invites him ( out of nostalgia ) to work at his magazine . sidney is of course excited and moves to america , there he meets a girl currently writing a book , and hilarity ensues . this film is great and i hope more come out like it in the near future . pegg has once again given people everywhere another good film and i cant wait to the see the third part of the blood and ice cream trilogy `` paul '' . i rate this film 81 % .
the sopranos is arguably the greatest show in dramatic television history . its hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence , sublime writing or first rate performances . across its epic scope it produces fresh and iconic characters and a constant level of high quality . centering around the life of one tony soprano , a man who lives in two families . one is the conventional wife and two kids nuclear family the other a huge new jersey mafia group , of which he is the boss of both . played by james gandolfini , of true romance and the mexican fame , tony is a fascinating , scary but also likable guy . full praise must be given to gandolfini for making a womanising and horrifically aggressive brute a genuinely identifiable and perfect leading man . contemporay american drama has never had such an arresting and iconic figure as tony . the cast of hundreds never boasts a flat performance and such stand out characters like paulie walnuts and ralph cifaretto will stick in your memory for ever . the true genius of this tale however , is the creator and writers bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series . twenty minute long dream sequences , powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical imagery and truly shocking scenes of violence . yet all this style is met by truly touching themes of love , honour and respect for family . the series never becomes cold hearted or gratuitous . with tv now competitive and often poor the sopranos stands tall above the rest as america 's most original and compelling drama . forget family redifined . this is television redifined .
human body -- - wow . there are about 27,000 sunrises in human life .... hardly one thousand sunrises will be watched by 90 % of humans on this planet .... our days are limited ... excellent movie for all women .... makers of human body ... thanks and regards .
skippy from family ties goes from clean-cut to metal kid in this fairly cheesy movie . the film seems like it was made in response to all those upset parents who claimed metal music was turning their kids evil or making them kill themselves - except in this one a dead satanic metal star is trying to come back from the grave ( using skippy to help out ) . and while the plot is corny and cliche , the corniness ( for example , an evil green fog taking off a girl 's clothes ) and the soundtrack are what make the movie so hilarious ( and great ) . and of course , there 's nothing like ozzy osbourne playing a preacher who 's asking what happened to the love song : ) . definitely a movie for having a few friends over for a good laugh . and while you 're at it , make it a double feature with slumber party massacre 2 - there 's an `` evil rocker '' ( as stated on the video box ) driller killer in black leather w/fringe . a must see for cheesy movie fans .
meryl streep is excellent in her nuanced and stoic performance as the infamous lindy chamberlain who was accused and tried for allegedly killing her own baby azaria chamberlain and using her alibi of ravenous dingoes as her defense . based on the book `` evil angels '' and titled so in its australian release , a cry in the dark is an ugly film to watch . it presents a scenario that 's all too real for us in america : the witch-hunt against a person deemed an easy target . lindy chamberlain was this woman . being someone who spoke her mind , someone who did n't play the sympathy card , and someone who was just tough enough to move on with her life despite her horrific ordeal , she was labeled as suspect and hated beyond comprehension even when it was clear she did n't kill her own child . the media began a tightening noose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon had the entire nation glued to their sets as they eviscerated this family piece by piece . and through it all , lindy remained as stoic as ever , even when her husband michael was falling apart . this stance , of course , is the power of strength , as unsympathetic as it may look like , and people happen to react strongly to that . they want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally faint at every turn , not sit there and look blank . people do n't understand that not everyone grieves the same way and when someone decides to stand strong they begin speculations . meryl streep embodies this tainted woman to the hilt and in doing so creates a cold , but not unfeeling woman , one that stood by her convictions even if they cost her liberty . because of her , sam neill is allowed to have his character slowly dissolve into despair -- someone has to , or the chamberlains would be too detached , and no one wants to see that . except the monster that has at the time of this writing become the news-media . they 'll always eat train wrecks up and feed the mangled manure to the uninformed public .
i gave this film 10 not because it is a superbly consistent movie , but for it 's pure ability to evoke emotions in its audience . the story of one-woman's-struggle-against-all-odds is an old cliché by now , but very few films have carried it off with so much warmth and sincerity as the color purple . it also showed a different side to the african-american experience - showing that after slaves were granted freedom many fell into the ways of the hated 'white man ' and were abusive of their own people . i find this an important point as it goes against the portray-white-on-black-violence-and-win-an-oscar trend . also the acting performances are superb - especially oprah who i now have a new found respect for . well worth watching - but keep some tissue handy .
`` father of the pride `` was another of those good shows that unfortunately do n't have a very long life . and that is pretty sad , specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air ( think in `` the simple life `` ) i admit that are many similarities with this show and `` the simpsons '' , but despite the similarities , the show have it own merits . the animation is just adequate , not incredible , but is good .the best are the characters . all the animals are very likable and funny , and even sigfried and roy had their moments . the music was good , i liked many of the songs . even if the show is n't very original , i think that this had lots of potential .like `` mission hill `` a show that is n't very famous but i liked a lot , this did n't have the appreciation that it deserved . what a shame .
war inc. is a funny but strange film . the actors are likable , the film is likable also , but i do n't know how to describe the plot . i will go into the plot later on . this is a movie with some weird casting choices . besides john cusack as a hit-man , which we saw years ago in grosse point blank which i liked . here we have hilary duff playing a russian pop star named yonica babyya or something like that . her character is odd . there is a scene where she sticks a scorpion down her pants . and hits on hauser ( cusack ) . there is a twist in the end involving the two characters . it makes sense . that is the only casting choice i am going into . cause it just plain strange . the whole movie is strange . but at times incredibly funny and i was never bored . here we have some of the best actors out there . excluding miss duff . she ai n't great . but here we have john cusack , marisa tomeii , joan cusack , ben kingsley . see what i mean ? this is the story of a hit-man named hauser ( cusack ) . he is sent down to some middle eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named omar sheriif ( not the actor ) . while trying to deal with his own personal problems , he has to help out the wedding of a popstar ( played by hilary duff ) . and he falls in love with a news reporter ( played by marisa tomeii ) . there is a thing about the popstar though . hauser is disgusted by her . there is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws up . the twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why . the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming . but that does n't matter . this is a strange , funny , and entertaining comedy . i love most of the actors . so really , how could i not recommend it ? war , inc . :3.5/5
terrfic film with a slightyly slow start - give it a chance to start cooking . story builds in interest and complexity . characters and storyline subvert expectation and cliche at all the right moments . superb new york city locations - gritty , real - are a fantastic antidote to the commercial imperatives of `` sex in the city '' - in fact , the entire film is an antidote to the hbo/hollywood notion of new york city , sex and relationships . it 's a rare film that treats its characters so honestly and compassionately . loved it ! great cast with notable performances by steve buscemi , rosario dawson , and her love interest ( forgot his name ! ) .
four macho rough'n'tumble guys and three sexy gals venture into a remote woodland area to hunt for a bear . the motley coed group runs afoul of crazed vietnam veteran jesse ( an effectively creepy portrayal by alberto mejia baron ) , who not surprisingly does n't take kindly to any strangers trespassing on his terrain . director/co-writer pedro galindo iii relates the gripping story at a steady pace , creates a good deal of nerve-rattling tension , and delivers a fair amount of graphic gore with the brutal murder set pieces ( a nasty throat slicing and a hand being blown off with a shotgun rate as the definite gruesome splatter highlights ) . the capable cast all give solid performances , with especially praiseworthy work by pedro fernandez as the nice , humane nacho , edith gonzalez as the feisty alejandra , charly valentino as the amiable charly , and tono mauri as antagonistic jerk mauricio . better still , both yummy blonde marisol santacruz and lovely brunette adriana vega supply some tasty eye candy by wearing skimpy bathing suits . antonio de anda 's slick , agile cinematography , the breathtaking sylvan scenery , pedro plascencia 's robust , shuddery , stirring score , the well-developed characters , and the pleasingly tight'n'trim 76 minute running time further enhance the overall sound quality of this bang-up horror/action hybrid winner .
* * * * = a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten * * * 1/2 = a classic in time ; simply a must see * * * = a solid , worth-while , very entertaining piece * * 1/2 = a good movie , but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws * * = may still be considered good in areas , but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable ( e.g. , genre ) * 1/2 = mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile moments bomb = not of a viewable quality - kalifornia = * * * - unrated ( for strong violent material , considerable sexuality , and language ) i rented this film expecting an in-your-face summer-blockbuster-quality celebration of brad pitt 's face , but was happily surprised and disappointed . this really is more of a drama , and very grim at that ... i remember some emotionally intense duchovny voice-overs . pitt plays out his possibly un-sexiest film ever with startling talent . who started out as a hopeless yet harmless `` white trash '' husband became realized as a violent , disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind . during some of the latter stages in the film , i found it hard to keep watching him - he was unpredictable and scary . this proves very good writing and acting . the whole movie is filled with bizarre , sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once , and i do n't mean action scenes . i mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted i actually winced and gasped at what i was seeing . it was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death . again , i am very impressed with the screenwriter ( s ) ; whoever they are did the impossible : mixed oil and water . i also very much enjoyed juliette lewis 's performance . it is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy . some of her moments in this film brought me to tears . i mean that . the emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible , and i clearly remember getting blurry-eyed on a few occasions . i almost feel like i 'm cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving `` kalifornia '' a * * * rating . but the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it . i do believe that everyone should see this movie though . i truly do .
it was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot , the characters in the show were great as well , and complimented one another well . i was sorry to see it cut off .. i would have loved to see where it could have went.you found yourself leaning toward lucas buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone . lucas was frightening and alluring . and i would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became . i will however buy the show just to enjoy , it was great to something different on tv . and paige turrco who was caleb 's cousin , she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to lucas . its a shame it is n't around still .. or was never finished , i would have loved to see what would have happened .
an inventive , suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia . a japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms . not completely successful , but taut , surprising and well-acted . one might find the film somewhat reminiscent of saw  two men trapped in room and pitting against each other  but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film . it 's like watching a lab experiment . some might find the contained suspense tedious , but this reviewer found it enthralling . the sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized . this is a certainly a good film to use to show off a good home video system . just right for a late night movie fest , when one is in the paranoid mood . it certainly kept me awake that night .
trudy lintz ( rene russo ) was one very fortunate lady many years ago . she was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money . her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds . trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children . they dressed in clothes and had many amenities . one day , she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla . knowing nothing about the large apes , she relies on her husband 's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla 's life . once out of danger , trudy decides she will raise the gorilla , also , as one of her children . this works well for years and buddy , the gorilla , is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home . but , buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous . will trudy be able to keep buddy under control ? for those who love animals , buddy is a must-see movie . based on a true story , trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore . of course , buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one , in the film , but he is very close to seeming totally real . russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice . the costumes are exemplary , as befitting the earlier era of the story , and the settings and production values outstanding . but , most importantly , animals are here in abundance , not only buddy , but the adorable chimps , the ducks , the rabbits , and so forth . for those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven , here on earth , this is a great movie choice . all animal lovers , and even those who just want to watch a great family film , will go `` ape '' over buddy .
my definition of a great movie is if you want to continue to see it over again . this movie for some reason strikes a cord in me even though the scenes with scott glenn still make me winch ; i watch it over and over again and love the music !
robert urich was a fine actor , and he makes this tv movie believable . i remember watching this film when i was 15 , and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same . people lose who they were when enter this exclusive club , in a computer rich californian town . urich try 's to figure out what is wrong with his family , and i love the halloween space suit idea , brilliant . this film is about the battle of one 's sprit . tv quality , that exceeds , the big budget , gangs of new york . i wonder if robert urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie ? i hope so ! 6 or 7 out of 10 .
it 's hard to find an outright bad historical drama that 's based on the life of any number of british monarchs . just take a well respected british or australian actor , make things look pretty , and you 're guaranteed a formula for oscar success . the young victoria is no exception , getting just about everything right , the cinematography striking and beautiful , with soft lights and lush colors and fabrics . starring emily blunt in a role she can finally soar in , the film begins with victoria 's 18th birthday and moves through the intrigue and issues that surrounded her eventual rise to the throne and her famous marriage to prince albert ( rupert friend ) . as the young victoria herself laments , she 's moved like a chess pawn by a variety of parties as she finds her footing and her voice as one of britain 's most influential rulers . while this moving around the chess board is fairly typical territory , it is the development of victoria 's relationship with albert that makes the film slightly more interesting . i confess : i have a degree in history with a specialization in the victorian era , so i 'm a bit attached to these figures . despite their many flaws as rulers , victoria and albert were some of the first leaders devoted to improving civilization for their people . they left their legacy in the arts , in public health and education , and in victoria 's conservative views and mourning culture after albert 's death . but these things are only briefly hinted at during the film . it is fairly well established that victoria and albert were not only madly in love , but held a level of respect for each other not usually seen between monarchs in arranged marriages . even if it did occur behind the scenes , their 's was certainly one of the best known . blunt and and friend have just the right type of chemistry to do the famous pair justice , the proper mix of restraint and desperation . it 's a different love , not usually shown on screen , especially in this sort of film . it 's encouraging to finally see a relationship in which man and woman are on a equal playing field . but we do n't get to see that love enough . while the filmmakers try to fit the affair amongst the political trappings , it does n't quite build up the sort of momentum needed to keep the tension high . also , without delving into the more advanced important public work of the pair , things feel a bit in limbo , superficial instead of intimate , and sometimes confusing . it 's not as big an issue during the film , but afterward , the effects wear off rather quickly and you find yourself trying to remember what you just watched , despite the perfect performances by the leads , most noticeably blunt who even captures the famous monarch 's expressions . for as much as it tries , victoria succeeds on many levels but lacks that certain sparkle that would take it from solid to classic .
with films like `` wallace & gromit '' and `` chicken run '' under their belt , the good people from the other side of the pond , aardman animation , are now introducing us to a bit of their twisted humor in the form of `` creature comforts '' . derived from a short done early in their careers , `` creature comforts '' is a slice-of-life show where snippets of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some sort . aardman animation went across the country interviewing people with innocuous questions such as , `` are you a liar ? '' and then speed things up a bit asking about their sex lives . the answers , while seeming to be boring and mundane , are actually quite funny , when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later . how many of these animals look like the person making the statements ? one of the characters discussing what he looks for in a woman , `` i like them kind of thin . '' is an insect , the walking stick . there are two dogs discussing odors and smells , while sniffing the behind of a poodle , as they talk about the different smells of a woman . there are two birds in a cage . as the `` wife '' tells the litany that is her health , her long suffering husband stands by her , saying nothing . while it might take some time for `` creature comforts '' to find it 's `` legs '' , it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary . while there are more reality shows than carter has liver pills , `` creature comforts '' is one of a kind and definitely worth watching . some of the humor might seem a little racy , it 's the claymation that catches the attention of the children ( like the old batman series of the 60 's , the jokes are subtle enough the kids wo n't get them ) and it 's the jokes that are there for the adults .
before the regular comments , my main curiosity about this is not a love song is that while there 's a running time listed on imdb of 94 minutes , the dvd from wellspring media in the united states runs 88 minutes . any input on this is appreciated ! two friends with very rough lives take on the road for an adventure . what they wind up in is just that , with one accidentally shooting a girl and the two escaping by foot into the countryside . rather than just a big chase , the film is complicated by the the daft and rather childlike spike behaving inappropriately , and clutching his boom box like a teddy bear . some viewers may dislike the story based solely upon the character spike , but without a bit of frustration added to the story , the film would have been too easy . you 'll notice the way the more stable character heaton refers to spike as `` big man '' in contrast to spike 's `` kid out of control '' attitude and behavior . frankly , i too was aggravated by spike 's ridiculous actions , especially the spray can sniffing , but in a desperate situation it 's apparent someone of his mentality would choose an temporary escape . but , heaton was there to keep things in check up until things get way over his head as well . kenny glenaan as heaton is a marvel , and after a while i quit wondering why in the heck he would want to pick spike up from prison and continue a friendship , due to glenaan 's great performance . after all , there are many many reasons during their run that would be a good idea for heaton to just ditch spike and try to save himself . i suppose heaton felt like a protective older brother to spike , and the loyalty between the two is hard to break -- until things get too desperate . while some of the cinematography is indeed artsy , it does offer more flavor to story instead of just shots of the men running through the wilderness . the beautiful landscapes , rain , and vast gray skies offer a somber tone that increases the feel of the tragic circumstances . the score is unusual as well , and the use of public image ltd. 's song `` this is not a love song '' and as the title of the film is quite smart . overall , it 's understandable if you do n't care for this is not a love song as it 's focused on two contrasting personalities escaping from another man determined to hunt them down ( played by a cool , quiet david bradley ) . it 's not big-budget action entertainment . for the rest of us that enjoy seeking out something minimal and dramatic , it 's time worthwhile spent , and it does offer some extremely tense moments that have you holding your breath a bit . i 'm really enjoying the films coming out of scotland recently , with the likes of this one , dog soldiers , and the devil 's tattoo . i 'm also a bit thankful for the subtitles offered on this dvd , as the accents are sometimes lightning fast and difficult for some viewers like me to understand . frustrating , dark , and often tense , this is not a love song is very tragic yet engrossing storytelling .
i recently found a copy for $ 5 at a video store , and snapped it up eagerly . while the music and ( obviously ) graphics are n't up to the standards of my favorite of the series , beyond the mind 's eye , i am still entranced by one segment : stanley and stella in `` breaking the ice '' . the music is brilliant , and the emotions feel real . the clip on odyssey 's website does n't have the story nor the music , unfortunately .
i only wish that return of the jedi , have been directed by somebody else , i mean , there is far too much ewoks scenes , completely unnecessary . besides this time our heroes look like different people : princess leia no longer fights with solo , luke looks boring , darth vader is not as evil as before , and yoda just dies . but there are many extraordinary things going on this episode that i just ca n't hate it . some spoilers 1- jabba the hut 2- the sail barge attack sequence . 3-the emperor ( now that 's evil ) 4- the speeders chase at the endor forest . 5-the last battle . 6-the dark side seduction scene . 7-the return of anakin to the good side of the force . 8- and the last celebration . some of those are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes . if some scenes would have been cut , and another director was hired , this would have been as perfect as episode 4 and 5 , but still is extraordinary . 9 out of 10 .
what can i say about this movie ? i have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around 6 . i have seen the english version and it is done very well . it is a great movie for all ages , but it is directed more for children . i love the childlike humor and appreciate it . if you have not seen it , you should try to rent a copy , you will not be disappointed !
this is n't exactly a great film , but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different . the film 's main theme is fate and small , seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future . in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors , though instead of focusing on one random event , seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion . plus , an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene -- like he 's some sort of omnipotent being but there 's absolutely no explanation of him in the film ( like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxy ) . the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou . this is capitalize on her success in amelie , though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role . the pace is brisk , the acting fine and the conclusion is n't bad at all . the only reason i did n't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots .
creature comforts in america should have been released on a different network , or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes . unfortunately , this was not the case . given that american audiences ( seemingly ) have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes , or has a preoccupation with scatological functions ( both sound and smells ) , shows like this will be few and far between . one of the main problems was that however brilliant it was , it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching . which is sad , but not unexpected . i would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct dvd release . the material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface . but thanks to political correctness , such conversations take place only in my mind .
eddie murphy really made me laugh my ass off on this hbo stand up comedy show.i love his impressions of mr. t , ed norton and ralph cramden of `` the honeymooners '' , elvis presley , and michael jackson too.the ice cream man , goony goo goo , is also funny.i saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984.i laughed so hard , i almost fell off my chair.i still think this is very funny . eddie murphy , when he was on `` saturday night live '' , made me laugh so hard , he is one of the best people to come out of '' saturday night live '' . `` eddie murphy delirious '' is his best stand up performance next to `` eddie murphy raw '' . i give `` eddie murphy delirious '' 2 thumbs up and 10/10 stars .
i believe this is the most powerful film hbo pictures has made to date . this film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen . it is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out . chris gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the screenplay . the performances from stephen rea , donald sutherland and jeffery demunn are flawless . a masterpiece of the genre .
my favorite movie . what a great story this really was . i 'd just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible .
it 's rare that i sit down in front of the tv specifically to watch a particular programme . it 's even rarer when i actually enjoy the programme in the end , but last of the blonde bombshells was one of the best movies i think i 've seen . a remarkable cast , led by dame judi dench and ian holm , and an excellent , witty and poignant script combined to make it a truly rewarding experience . i ca n't really express how good i thought it was , so i wo n't try , i 'll just say , if you get the opportunity , please see it ! ! ! ! i only hope it comes out on video .
while originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching `` lost '' , i accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1the one with the polar-bearand it has had my undivided attention ever since . the show , that is . not the polar bear . so bear ( heh ) with me while i throw out as much rambling , semi-coherent praise as i can muster . `` lost '' takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island , and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchinglywhat drives them , who are they ? where did they come from ? it soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives , whether they 're running away from something ( sawyer and kate among others ) or getting in touch with spirituality ( locke , claire ) . but `` lost '' also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses ... and they all seem to be strangely connected . while television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities , most of the cast of `` lost '' are , in truth , spectacular actors for their respective parts , projecting heart and humour in their performances . there 's also a multitude of eyecandy , but not generally of the plastic hollywood kind as most tv shows . the characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch . their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness , petty arguments or cheesy melodrama ( although they are annoyingly secretive )  these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action . the realism of these characters facilitate an already well-sculptured plot . about this plot ... imagine a tree as the template plot , then the branches as subplots ( in this case , one branch for every character )  well , lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines . if you 're a brother/sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks , you will get your own storyline . if you 're a dog you will have your own storyline . unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end , they are setting themselves up . i am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop-out to this show , as i 'm sure most people are . but assuming the writers do pull this off , `` lost '' is possibly the best show ever to hit television . 9/10
emory is a cincinatti steel worker like his father before him and for most of the 20th century the twin pillars of his family 's existence have been the steel mill and the union . the mill , which once employed 45,000 , has seen its numbers dwindle to 5,000 recently and now 1 , as the plant just shut its doors , leaving a single security guard . at first , newly-unemployed emory and his pals enjoy their independence , hanging out around town and carousing at their favorite bar , where they down `` depth charges '' with reckless abandon . they think the mill will reopen after listening to their union rep 's optimistic spiel , but reality starts to sink in when they find themselves selling their personal vehicles in a struggle to put food on the table and stave off foreclosure of their homes . emory 's father - a dedicated union man - is sure the plant will reopen and recalls for his son all the short-lived closures during his own 35 years at the mill . meanwhile , some of the unemployed men take demeaning make-work jobs or hop in their trucks and take off in a desperate search for employment . finally the union admits its helplessness , as emory explains to his stubborn father that times have changed and that the mill wo n't ever open again . emory tearfully asks `` what did i do wrong ? '' as a lifetime of hard work and devotion to job , union , church and family have left him with nothing and nowhere to turn . he hits rock bottom when in a drunken rage he manhandles his young sons and knocks his wife to the floor . tossed out of his own home and stinging from the plant manager 's comments that he and his men did n't work hard enough to justify their substantial paychecks , emory recruits the steel workers still left in town to do something that will demonstrate to all what they are capable of . early in the morning they break into the mill , fire up the furnaces and work harder than they ever have in their lives , producing in one shift enough high-quality steel pipes to fill the loading docks from wall to wall , top to bottom - something the plant manager thought was impossible . arriving at the suddenly-reopened plant , the stupefied manager looks around him at the tremendous output that came from a single day 's work , realizing that production like this could make the plant profitable again . the manager asks emory : `` can you do this every day ? '' emory is forced to nod `` no '' and the manager asks : `` then what were you trying to prove ? '' emory explains that the workers ' decades of hard work , honesty and devotion to their jobs had meaning and that by showing how much they could produce in one day `` we just spit in your eye . '' emory bids a tearful farewell to his wife and kids as he takes off with his buddies to look for work down south , promising to relocate the family when he finds it . this is a powerful and honest treatment of the plight of american workers displaced by foreign competition and gives a realistic view of the costs they bear for the short-sightedness of concession-demanding unions and greedy plant owners who extracted every penny they could from their factories but never gave back by modernizing them . peter strauss as emory , john goodman as his best friend , gary cole as his college-boy brother , pamela reed as emory 's sympathetic wife and john doucette as his dying father all turn in excellent performances in this fine picture .
astounding ..... this may have been a poor attempt at remaking the already recreated omen movie , but i sure enjoyed it . that last man who commented is a fool , this movie was one of a kind , and the music dark , jerry goldsmith himself , would had applaud this movie . great recommendations from myself to watch or buy this film . i collect horror movies and soundtracks , so listen to what i have to say , not that other idiot . there is only one thing that do not fascinate me , the endings . according to prophecy it is all inaccurate , including final conflict , and left behind . but my conclusion being .... there great movies ... and should be seen , before the great depression falls upon us , and before the democrats take over the presidency too . so signed .... jacob eder ... a farmer , with a mastermind .
i loved long way round and was n't even aware of race to dakar until i saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket . i bought it and after a slightly 'hmm will this be as good ' first episode i decided that it was . charlie boorman was great as were the other members of the crew . great to see him with ewan again . there was a fair bit of swearing in it but that did n't bother me . as for their being no mention of it on the package . thats more to do with the silly excempt from classification certificate that the bbfc have . they should have given it a 15 just for the language alone . highly recommended series , i want more ! !
this movie is very entertaining , and any critique is based on personal preferences - not the films quality . other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy , the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor . it has some pretty good special effects , and exciting action scenes . as a finder of lost children , murphy 's character starts off looking for a missing girl , which leads him on the path for which others believe he was `` chosen '' - - to protect the golden child . the young boy is born as an enlightened one , destined to save the world from evil forces , but whose very life is in danger , if not for the help of murphy , and his beautiful , mysterious and mystical helper/guide/protector . also , there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts . one such scene is where the golden child , that murphy 's character is solicited to protect , is tested by the monks of the mountain temple . an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from , and the child is tested on his choice . this is a fantasy/comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware . as we accept this premise of the plot , we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality , and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away , and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us . this is an excellent movie , with a good plot , fine acting , and for the most part , pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting , and eddie murphy humor .
deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of grownups ( bill paxton , julie warner , kevin pollak , elizabeth perkins , vincent spano , matt craven , and diane lane ) who are invited back to spend a week to tomawka , a camp in ( ontario ) canada by their former consuelor ( alan arkin ) . writer/director mike binder drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense . also , the movie has plenty of funny moments , some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite , the one involves using masking tape . newton thomas sigel ( `` the usual suspects '' , `` three kings '' ) provides the film with some impressive shots of the canadian wilderness . among the cast , sam raimi , director of `` the evil dead '' films and `` the gift '' , appears here as arkin 's bumbling right-hand man . one more thing , this film reassured me that a camp does n't have to be a site of bloody murders .
most people who chase after movies featuring audrey tautou seem to not understand that amelie was a character - it is not really audrey tautou 's real life personality , hence , every movie she partakes in is not going to be amelie part 2 , part 3 , etc . now with that said , i too picked up this movie simply because audrey was in it . yes , it 's true , there is a big gap after the first scene where she is n't seen at all for maybe 45 min , but i did n't even miss her because i was having so much fun with the other characters . the guy who lies about everything is too funny , the guy who justifies people who run out of his cafe and skip out on the bill by finding coupons and such which balance out the loss , actually .... getting into all the characters here could take quite a while , but this is one of the best movies i 've seen in a while . audrey tautou 's character irene is not the overdone sugary girl that amelie was . in fact , as irene , her rudeness to a bum asking for change caught me off guard at first . in this film , irene is a girl with good intentions , but over the course of a ( very awful ) day , her disposition becomes more and more sour and pessimistic . what makes this film completely great is you have all these really interesting stories and plots building ... very entertaining to watch , great scenery and shots , very colorful and never too slow , and all of the characters can actually act . the best part of the movie comes with about 20 minutes left .... this is when all of the plots start to mesh together and the ride really picks up and everything ties together and makes sense , and the whole butterfly effect blossoms . i swear , it was the best 20 minutes of film i 've seen in quite a while , and the ending .... it made me think `` damn i really lucked out finding this movie '' . the ending to this movie is top notch . whoever wrote the script for this is brilliant , because not only are there all these other subplots going on , but to somehow make them all tie in together ( and in a sensible manner , which is the case here ) but also to make each character feel human and come alive , not just some stale persona used as a crutch to build up this whole butterfly effect ... very impressive . i highly suggest this movie as it 's a great film to watch anytime , in any mood , with any company or alone .
besides the fact that it was one of the few movies that i ever shed a tear over ( bye-bye manhood ) , this is one of the most beautifully crafted indian films that has ever been made . from the finely crafted sets , to those haunting looks meena kumari gives , no one can ever forget it . the music of pakeezah is amazing , all the more if you can understand the sublime poetry , and is definitely one of those `` omg , 5 minutes another song '' movies . you get the feeling of how trapped sahibjaan is in among all the amazing jewelery she wears and fountained court yard she casually walks past . a parody of all the dreams you 've ever had ..........
one of my favourite films . it has everything - rocking soundtrack , courtesy of eddie clark , ex motorhead , loads of action , loads of laughs , totally ridiculous plot and the most wonderful '80 's stereotypes as characters . eddie , the put-upon nice guy , who just wants to be left alone to be different , leslie ( about as wet as they come ) , nuke ( the rock burn-out ) , eddie 's mom ( pathetic ) , roger ( the geek ) and ozzy as the preacher ( surely he exists in america ? ) . then there are the boys ( rich , vicious and stupid ) and the girls ( vacant , vain and stupid ) . what more could you ask for ? well , first of all , there 's sammi curr , the rock star , an amalgam of every '80 's badass rocker you can think of . what about that rocket firing guitar ? then there 's the scene where sammi pulls the old lady through the tv screen and smashes her up . and what does roger do ? why , hoover her up , just like a good geek would . my favourite scene is where tim hainey gets his long overdue reward from sammi via the wet finger in the plug - magic ! if you were into rock in the '80 's or just love ridiculous films like i do , then check this one out . it 's available on dvd and very cheap so ( trick or ) treat yourself .
a somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of abraham lincoln 's early years from director john ford , concentrating primarily on a trial in which the young lawyer defends two brothers accused of murder . the film offers an interesting portrayal of this important american figure and the film is well made , but seems somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments from his presidency or even his debates with stephen douglas . the obvious intent was to portray lincoln as young man developing the attributes that would make him the great man he would become . but the result for me was that while i admired the portrayal it just was n't as satisfying as i think it could have been with a greater scope . in the role of abraham lincoln we have henry fonda who effectively displays a quiet strength . fonda 's performance includes some gangly mannerisms ' and other affectations which are fairly effective in presenting a portrayal of lincoln , particularly when combined with some effective makeup and the costuming which occasionally is a bit to overt . the supporting cast is solid and surprisingly does not include that many of ford 's regular supporting cast ( sometimes referred to as his stock company ) but we do have ward bond one of the most prolific character actors in hollywood . bond has appeared in more of the afi top 100 films than any other actor , both the original and revised list . he has also appeared in 11 best picture nominees . the film features one scene that would seem to have inspired a quite similar scene in `` to kill a mockingbird '' , where it would be done even better than it is here , even though that scene is one of the most effective in this film .
`` footlight parade '' is just one of several wonderfully jaunty musicals that warner bros. produced in the early 1930 's to ward off the depression . `` 42nd street '' and the golddiggers series were also produced during this era , and they made literally , millions of americans forget their troubles for a little while , and enjoy themselves . while most of the films produced had the great talents of joan blondell , ruby keeler , and dick powell , only foolight parade had the incomparable james cagney . almost ten years prior to his most well-known musical , `` yankee doodle dandy '' . here he dances in that most original of dance styles , with his arms usually lowered at his side , and his legs doing all types of undulations and kicks . it 's easy to see that he is enjoying himself , and that makes us enjoy him all the more . while almost all of the musical sequences appear at the end of the film , they are well worth the wait . i believe that this film was made just prior to the installation of the production code , so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit risqué . but it 's all in fun . it does n't matter what the plot of the film is , just know that there are plenty of laughs and a superlative cast . besides those already mentioned , guy kibbee is at his flustered best here . 7 out of 10
upon seeing this film once again it appeared infinitely superior to me this time than the previous times i have viewed it . the acting is stunningly wonderful . the characters are very clearly drawn . brad pitt is simply superb as the errant son who rebels . the other actors and actresses are equally fine in every respect . robert redford creates a wonderful period piece from the days of speakeasies of the 1920s . the scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of western montana . all in all , this is one of the finest films made in the 1990s . you must see this movie !
i saw this movie back in 1984 , we first started watching `` this is spinal tap '' and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep . so we went instead to see this movie . if you have any conspiracy theory 's going around in your head , you will want to watch this one . the question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie are : do you think the government would be capable of doing this ? ( in my opinion there is no doubt that they could ) but i do n't want to give out too much information as that would be a spoiler and i think that you should view the movie for yourself . but , just to let you know , we still talk about this movie 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world to do .
first-time director tom kiesche turns in a winning film in the spirit of cutting , dark comedy . shot on a shoestring budget , yet had the flavor of the early coen brother 's film blood simple ... and throw in some monty python flavorings to boot ! needs to seen more than once to appreciate all the elements that carry one scene to the next . expect more good things to come from this writer-director-actor .
i really liked tom barman 's awtwb . you just have to let it come over you and enjoy it while it lasts , and do n't expect anything . it 's like sitting on a café-terrace with a beer , in the summer sun , and watching the people go by . it definitely wo n't keep you pondering afterwards , that 's true , but that 's not a prerequisite for a good film . it 's just the experience during the movie that 's great . i felt there were a few strands that could have been worked out a little more , but being a lynch fan i do n't care that much anymore : ) and i * loved * the style , or flair of this movie . it 's slick , but fresh , and the soundtrack is a beauty . any music-lover will get his kicks out of awtwb , i can assure you . i 'll give it 8 out 10 . ( music-wise 10 out of 10 )
this film was the first british teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society , rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life . in an attempt to celebrate the work of liverpool 's junior liaison officers the opening title points out that 92 % of potential delinquents , who have been dealt with under this scheme , have not committed a second crime . however , this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen-drama until the film 's epilogue where we are instructed that we should n't feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed-up they might seem . stanley baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of juvenile liaison officer . this hard-boiled character is a role typical of baker . having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer . however , as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events , back to his original investigation . his first case leads him to the home of two young children , mary and patrick murphy ( played by real-life brother and sister duo ) , who have committed a petty theft . here he meets cathie ( satisfyingly portrayed by anne heywood ) their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with . it quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner-city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency . the elder brother of the murphy family , johnny , is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums . mccallum does an eye-catching turn as the americanized mixed-up kid , who owes more to the likes of marlon brando , than any previous british star . one is reminded of brando 's character johnny from 'the wild one ' who led a leather-clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film 's 'johnny ' leads his gang . thankfully the preachiness of earlier dearden crime dramas such as 'the blue lamp ' is not so apparent . instead we are presented with several well drawn-out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between heywood and baker takes the forefront . the plot , whilst at times predictable , does deliver some memorable scenes . the disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where johnny abandons himself to the music , leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant . the most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children , including mary and patrick , are held hostage at gunpoint by johnny . obviously in the light of the real-life dumblaine massacre this scene seems all the horrifying . understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences .
for what it is , `` raising victor vargas '' is about as close to perfection as a film can get . either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked ( probably some of each ) , this simple little slice-of-urban-life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds . the film begins with a strong flavor of `` street '' but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another . in my experience , never has so much been done with so little ( cast of tyros , novice director , etc. ) . praised by the critics but not for everyone , `` raising victor vargas '' is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness .

ok here is how i do this . i grade movies on 10 components . each component will inherently start with 5 points . it can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0 . mood : action , romance , comedy , drama , suspense - i give this component 10 points . it had a perfect balance of all five aspects . the action was fun and exiting . the romance was not overdone , but still very emotional and moving . i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama , and riveting suspense . plot - i give this component 10 points . i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told . i found my self , sitting in the theatre , returned to my childhood , and in that instant i again believed in unicorns , wicked witches , and falling stars that make dreams come true . cinema photography - i give this component 8 points . while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles , i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera . fx - i give this component 10 points . i love that they used c.g.i . sparingly . the epic scenes were believable . the magical powers were frighteningly realistic . all in all less is more , and this had it all ! cast - i give this component 10 points . no names and seasoned actors alike , the cast was amazing ! michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked , charlie cox made tristan come to life , claire danes gave emotion to the stars , and i will never look and robert de niro the same again . acting - i give this component 10 points . even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection . once again , i will never look and robert de niro the same again . character development - i give this component 9 points . this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice . dialogue - i give this component 10 points . the dialogue was smart , witty , fun even the mush had good dialogue . score - i give this component 7 points . i can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie . i am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable . ending - i give this component 9 points . almost perfect ending ! i feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced , while others could have been more subdued , but no threads were left untied . total : 93 % buy the dvd ? hel yes ! see it in the theatre ? most definitely ! bottom line : excellent movie for everyone ! epic ! i strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre , i know i 'll be going back for seconds !

about 1986 i saw this movie by accident on tv one night . i was 6 years old . it was similar to my accidental viewing of the terrifying ending to do n't look now in 1987 . i went to venice on holiday the next year in silent terror , hoping to god that my parents would n't find out i 'd watched it ! would i have minded if my parents knew i 'd watched les valseuses when i was a kid ? i 'd probably avoid the subject with my dad even nowadays , and my mum 's probably disapproving in the afterlife . i do n't know if they 'd want to see it anyway . from the stalking and trapping of a woman at the block of flats in the first scene to sliding down the mountain roads with glazed satiated eyes i 'm never sure whether this film is an insensitive piece of trash that disregards the sexual revolution or if it 's a sexy liberating movie to watch as it dawns on you that you could never be so offensive yourself . it 's definitely violent . it has a violent view of sex , virtually no acknowledgement of love . even suckling a young baby mutates into a greedy sexual act of exploitation . but the scenario is very erotic and ( god i 'm so british ) arousing ! do they suck her breasts for her own good ? that is exploitation . so why am i getting a woody ? the fellows go in search of an experienced older woman , find an ex-con , mother-figure ? i do n't know . it ends in a truly gruesome suicide . i described it to my friend jb nelson , who has cannibal holocaust-guts , and he went eeuurrgghh ! no motherly love for this movie , quite the opposite . mutilation of where the boys began . why do they shoot the girl in the leg ? why does she come back to them ? do women need to be punished so that they learn what is right from men ? i 'm thinking of two movies , one of which i wish i 'd never seen , the other makes me wish it was n't such a harsh world . swept away/madonna what a pile of insanity does n't compute never been so offended that a woman punished for being a woman becomes slave to man and its maybe madonna saying everybody respect guy ritchie im so enraged i cant use punctuation ! once upon a time in america/leone god why does noodles do it ? destroys the path to joy we 've been following him on his whole life . so close to finally finding love with deborah . now they are both destroyed . why sergio ? why ? there is no rape in les valseuses but lots of sex and nakedness in abundance , of both sexes . very honest , no titillation . no fantasy shags , no perfect hollywood smooth moves . jokes , yes . but there 's too much darkness and jealousy and trickery in here to call it a sex comedy . forget carry on shooting a naked hairdresser in the leg cos she 'll come back & you 'll hook her up with your ex-con lover 's vengeant son & she 'll learn how to cum from him . two things i ca n't stand are rape movies and prison movies . les valseuses is n't a rape movie ! god nobody 's going to want to watch it now ! it is a brilliant movie !
we saw this at one of the local art movie theaters in the montrose area of houston , tx . it was a total surprise compared to the write-up in the theater 's newsletter but we were both blown away by the artistry . it was beautifully done and ( apparently ) photographed in a schloss ( german name for château ) somewhere in the munich area . it is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twentyish men and women isolated from the day-to-day constraints . it is fantastic on more levels than i can remember . we came home after the movie and talked and talked until about 4 am the next morning . the version we saw was in english ( mostly ) so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the movie in ( probably its original ) german version . i searched and searched for a video tape version but never came up with anything . would absolutely love to have a vhs or dvd version of this . it explores relationships at a fundamental level and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner . if anyone knows the writer/director , please convince him to release again , preferably on dvd these days . i can not even imagine getting tired of watching the candid performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties . please , please bring it back .
this is an early film `` pilot '' for the hit canadian tv show trailer park boys . it was played to executives at a few networks before showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series . great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films . the movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around `` exterminating '' peoples pets for money . if you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to ! but they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout . watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series . i highly recommend it ! rated r for swearing , violence , and drug use . its not too offensive either ( they dont actually show killing animals )
` mad dog ' earle is back , along with his sad-sack moll marie , and that fickle clubfoot velma . so are babe and red , doc and big mac , and even the scenery-chewing mutt pard . the only thing missing is a good reason for remaking raoul walsh 's high sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame , and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original . ( instead of walsh we get stuart heisler , for humphrey bogart we get jack palance , for ida lupino shelley winters , and so on down through the credits . ) the only change is that , this time , instead of black-and-white , it 's in warnercolor ; sadly , there are those who would count this an improvement . i died a thousand times may be unnecessary  and inferior  but at least it 's not a travesty ; the story still works on its own stagy terms . earle ( palance ) , fresh out of the pen near chicago , drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin lon chaney , jr.  knocking over a post mountain resort . en route , he almost collides with a family of oakies , when he 's smitten with their granddaughter ; the smiting holds even when he discovers she 's lame . arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up , he finds amateurish hotheads at one another 's throats as well as winters , who throws herself at him ( as does the pooch ) . biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel , palance ( to winter 's chagrin ) offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl 's deformity , a gesture that backfires . then , the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath . on the lam , palance moves higher into the cold sierras .... it 's an absorbing enough story , competently executed , that lacks the distinctiveness walsh and his cast brought to it in 1941 , the year bogie , with this role and that of sam spade in the maltese falcon , became a star . and one last , heretical note : those mountains do look gorgeous in color .
after seeing 'break a leg ' in vancouver at the release party i thought it was a very enjoyable film . i had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos ( eric roberts in particular ) were a scream . i have n't heard word about actual release date although i 've heard it 's close . the story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations . the script is smooth and seamless , the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh . this film has won at least one award from each of the film festivals it 's been in , which is around 10 - 15 or so . i highly recommend 'break a leg ' .
this is what the musical genre was made of . humor , talent , romance , and action all rolled into one . frank sinatra was wonderful . nothing else needs to be said . marlon brando , although not a singer , did a great job winning the hearts of many with his portrayal of sky masterson . the fact that he could n't sing added to his character . the ladies in the film were alright , but the men in the movie definitely stole the show . it is a true classic that can be appreciated at any age . it connects with all audiences and makes you smile and laugh . definitely a movie to be watched and enjoyed !
any film in the early days of orson welles is a triumph all the way to the third man with joseph cotton . he is also wonderful in a touch of evil . please see them all ! he tends to get pompous and self serving in films like f is for fake , really stupid waste of film.do n't waste your time watching it . it is really ignorant . orson welles is a film icon and anyone studying film should see everything he has filmed . all his leading ladies are tremendous but in the end welles became a fat drunk , like his character in a touch of evil ! for some reason orson welles had a way with women , i see how he could be considered attractive in his youth , not like gary cooper or joseph cotton , or cary grant , john wayne , i could go on and on but i digress ... and because i am a woman , i can see the attraction to him . he ( orson welles ) is one of the last true film makers and unless you count the film-makers of today : tarantino , scorscese , spike lee , most of the film makers just do n't measure up to the film makers of the forties ! i know there are many more great film makers of today but in such a short amount of time i ca n't name them all . no offense to any of the great film makers of this millennium ! august 21,2006 . please remind me of some current up and coming film makers , i do n't want to be stuck in the past ! i love some of the films out now , but rarely are there any that i would put on a `` 100 best '' list .. `` hustle and flow '' was great , so was `` fargo '' , and `` oh , brother , where art thou , '' from a line in sullivan 's travels ; another fine film from the forties ! can anyone give me a best list for the 90 's and on up to 2006 ? i would like to know who to watch ! thank you ! also props to this website ! where else can you plug a film or boo it ! i love the ranting and raving from regular folks like me who can say what i want and i promise not to spoil any film for someone who has n't seen it yet !
cillian murphy and rachel mcadams star in this action/thriller written and directed by the master of suspense , wes craven , himself . the whole movie starts with some trouble at the lux atlantic , a hotel in miami . the problem is all fixed by lisa reisert , the manager of the hotel . then she goes to the airport , and that 's where all of the trouble begins . she meets jackson rippner , who does n't like to be called jack because of the name jack the ripper , if you know you him and i mean . then they board the plane , and crazy enough , rippner and reisert sit next to each other . for the next half-hour , lisa is terrorized , tormented , and terrified by rippner . i wo n't give anything away . then we move on to where jack is chasing lisa in the airport . then lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay , and crazily enough , rippner is already there . there is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene . in total , about 25 minutes of intense action comes at the end . not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it . like i said , i will not give anything away because it 's so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbing/frightening . and the acting from every single character in the movie , even the ones with no lines at all , were all pitch perfect . it was incredible . everything was awesome in this movie ! the acting , the music , the effects , the make-up , the directing , the editing , the writing , everything was wonderful ! wes craven is definitely the master of suspense . red eye is definitely a must-see and is definitely worth spending your money on . you could watch this movie over and over and over again and it would never ever get boring . red eye i have to say is better than 10 out of 10 stars . original mpaa rating : pg-13 : some intense sequences of violence , and language my mpaa rating : pg-13 : some very intense sequences of violence , and language my canadian rating : 14a : violence , frightening scenes , disturbing content
fire and ice is an animated film set in a fantasy world . the film is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier which is the home of the evil ice lord named nekron . the only survivor of the village is a young man named larn who sets out to avenge those who were killed by the glacier . the ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the princess of the land named teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures . larn sets out to find her and also sets out to find and kill nekron . fire and ice is directed by ralph bakshi who is one of my favourite adult animators . he has brought us such animated masterpieces as the film version of fritz the cat and some films he has written himself , like the great film heavy traffic . i did n't like fire and ice nearly as much as i have ralph bakshi 's other work , but i still found the film to be enjoyable . it had some very nice animation in parts and the story was entertaining enough . the only basic complaints i have is that i wish that there was more of a story to the film because the story it uses is very thin and there is not a lot to it . i also wish the film was a bit longer because it is under 80 minutes in running time . still it 's an entertaining action adventure films that unlike fritz the cat or heavy traffic is appropriate for kids 8 and older . i only wish that there was a more developed story and it went on a bit longer than it did .
i 'm not sure how i missed this one when it first came out , but i am glad to have finally seen it . this movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of okabasho , japan . it tells the tale of prostitution , caste systems and women who are strong in a society based upon the strength of the samurai code of japan . it is uniquely akira kurosawa ! even though he died before he could direct this movie , his adaptation of the screenplay shows . his view of the japanese world and caste system is renowned and sheds light upon how these systems interact with each other . the characters may revolve around each other , but the caste system stays intact when each character goes back to the world they belong in . the samurai warrior who drifts into the good hearted and loving prostitute 's world goes back to his life , while she embarks on a another road with a man who is part of her caste system .. lowest of the low . many prize the world of the samurai above all others , but yet , it is the lower caste inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint . the samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one , while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones . the movie deserves a higher rating . it is a tale of survival of women in feudal japan . during this time frame , men were thought to be the survivors .. the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property . this movie highlights the strength of japanese women and how they did what they had to for survival , and how their strength enabled the japanese culture to continue on as it has . i recommend `` the sea is watching '' to anyone who is a fan of akira kurosawa and even if they 're not a fan . it is a lovely , quiet and soul sustaining movie , and one to be treasured for any movie collection .
this is the most confronting documentary i have ever seen . it was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea . based on photographs of the hidden industrial landscapes centred around the modern industrial growth of china , edward burtynsky brings to life confronting issues that we so easily chose to ignore . taking no political sides , this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our western societies chooses not to educate us about - the by-products of economical growth , the externalities paid by citizens of the lesser-developed communities , the source of our comforts and the wastes of our consumer lifestyles . amazing , heart-breaking , impossible to ignore . this is a challenging journey but one worth taking - please stop staying ignorant and at least see these photographs of truth without feeling any pressure to take a standing to these issues . 10/10 definitely !
surprised to see the rather low score for this movie . just saw this film for the first time in 10 years , and was reminded why i like it . come back with me , children , to a time when michael keaton was a straight-up comedy guy , and you might find some joy in this film . it 's a gentle comedy -- the kind ron howard specializes in -- but if that 's your thing , you should check this out . keaton 's low-key charm is just right for this project . `` gung ho '' is a bit dated , because it takes places in the last stage of the pre-global economy world , when it still mattered what country a business was based in . that said , it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other , to great benefit . you could watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one scene in particular you really liked , but that 's because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughs . it 's like an i.v . drip . and i mean that in a good way .
this movie is not for everyone . you 're either bright enough to get `` it '' or you 're not . fans of sci-fi films who do n't take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie . i recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies . everyone i 've recommended this film to has enjoyed it . if you enjoy monty python or mel brooks films , you 'll probably enjoy this one . the voice characterizations are done in a tongue-in-cheek manner and the one-liners fly fast and furious .
when a movie shocks you with it 's disturbing , brooding atmosphere , and grabs you by the throat with it 's stunning cinematography , you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat , masterpiece of a film . although with most modern movies , extremely enjoyable as some are , those that really shock you into focus are the strongest , and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly , stick with you for a life time . i say , proudly , that i am a fan of movies that disturb , not just horror movies , but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding . movies like breakdown and the missing , that send a chill down your spine , making you think `` holy crap , that could happen to me '' , and visually entice you , are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie . because i am only 21 , i did not grow up with actors like burt renyolds , jon voight and ned beatty , albeit i am familiar with them , i did n't watch them grow and proceed as actors , as opposed to actors now like shia labouf and justin long . i must say , after the long hype and witnessing deliverance for the first time , i was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago , and still lives it 's terror up in competition to modern movies . burt renyolds plays lewis , the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made , filling the whole wilderness in water . renyolds ' character is an experienced adventurer , sort of no nonsense , and filled with machismo . witnessing him portray the tough guy , made me think differently about him as an actor , as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician . the dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader . ronny cox and ned beatty play as the novice adventurers , drew and bob respectively , joining in for the fun of a canoe trip . the actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was jon voight , once again i have only seen him as an older actor , however , unlike renyolds , i have quite liked voight 's acting ( and i do n't regard anaconda when i say that ) , for example the national treasure movies . voight plays ed , whom , like lewis , is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character , a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks lewis ' machismo . the film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside . you immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to , like the imbred kid who plays the infamous `` duelling banjo 's '' at the start of the film with ronny cox 's character drew ; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene . as with all atmospheric movies , from this moment on , dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form . the canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature 's odds for survival . the film 's cinematics do not let up , and i back that comment up with the scene in which ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow . as ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him , cocks his rifle , only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck ; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting i have seen in a film . in wrapping up , deliverance is one film , who 's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date , remains one of the best films in cinematic history .
who does n't have unresolved issues with parents ? and which parents do n't have unresolved issues with each other ? i know , that sounds heavy . but this is played for laughs in the movie , making both the comedy better and the drama better . i 've always like paul reiser and peter falk , and although i was a bit concerned that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie , i was enchanted from the very first scene . especially entertaining were the discoveries that the son makes about his father as a person . and peter falk 's monologue about being a hard-working , sacrificing father and husband was the perfect balancing point . without that scene being acted so well , the movie would have seemed far less nuanced , and the character far less interesting . nicely done , paul and peter !
a series of vignettes , most of them spoofing television of the 1970 's , but also with some digs at the government and corporate america . one of the longest segments , `` the dealers '' is not that funny to me and i do n't know what it is parodying . some of the others , though , are absolutely side-splitting . i particularly enjoy the cooking show segment . most of the foul words i know are used in the movie , and , if you object to full frontal nudity , stay away .
and i gave it a high 7 ..... why ? because it bloody well rocked . at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys/games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories . as others have said here it was ahead of its time . sadly this is why the show was doomed . they have released 4 dvds with 16 episodes of the series so far . i am hoping that more come out . how does this compare watching it now 20 years after it first came out .. i do n't know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation , and that imho is it 's only flaw . the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition ........ i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order ... the dvds are good but i do n't think the stories are in their proper order , but despite this the show rocked .
how anyone can say this is bad is beyond me . i loved this show before i even saw it . for 3 reasons , 1 . the story intrigued me , 2 . jessica alba and 3 . james cameron ! please ignore the bad comments and please watch the whole first season before you decide that it 's bad because i know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season 1 as well as season 2 on dvd and then join the campaign to get season 3 made ! i hate fox and i 'm sure a lot of you `` dark angel '' fans hate them too . they have a thing for canning good shows ! do n't you all agree ?
there are 21 comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism . this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it . it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15-year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action , to the humour and even to the beautiful music score . i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk , i will certainly be adding it to my collection .
the filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic . i liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930 's chinese-mainland countryside as well as more basic human questions - i felt i could get a real sense of the times , recreated even in splendid shots of traditional chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living . it seemed worthwhile to experience . the interwoven role which buddhism plays is probably the most true-to-form - both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect , perhaps the most effective that i 've seen in chinese film . casting is great . images are memorable . acting is solid enough . thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression .
i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer mccomb . it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course mccomb . at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards i am trying for vcd of this film but i am unable to find it . huge african lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them . all section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film . but some scenes involving mccomb forces parental guidance for this film . it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all .
fritz lang 's german medieval saga continues in die nibelungen : kriemhilds rache ( 1924 ) .kriemhild ( margarete schoen ) wants to avenge her murdered husband , siegfried.her brother is too weak to bring the murdered , hagen , to justice.kriemhild marries etzel , the king of the huns ( rudolf klein-rogge ) .she gives birth to a child , and invites her brothers for a party.etzel and the other huns should kil hagen , but he is protected by his brothers.we see a huge battle of life and death begins , and she sets the whole place on fire.eventually hagen is dead , and so is kriemhild.these movies deal with great themes , such as revenge and undying love.sure we have later seen some better movies made of those topics , but this was one of the early ones .
........... as i was when i saw this movie ) i will never watch this movie again , not because it is a bad movie , but because it scared me so much ! as i said , i was 14 when my english teacher decided to show it to us ; the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book . all the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and floats over kidd 's bed , although , just before that there is something that also frightened us , which was when kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow , and he hears a child 's voice say `` it 's for you '' . that scene still haunts me to this day , nearly 7 years after i saw the film . if you are easily scared , avoid this film ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
when i was chairman of our college 's coffeehouse , one of our jobs was to review groups and films for student activities . one of the best things to come along in 1972 was groove tube . the original premise was that it was being shown off-off broadway in theaters where television monitors were being placed throughout the audience , so everyone had a great seat . the premise was that the skits would change on a regular basis-ala saturday night live , keeping the thing fresh . they decided on making it into a film for general distribution . i believe the developers said it was the first time chevy chase was on film . watching him run naked though the woods was a howl . like many of the reviews before mine , it was saturday night live before such a thing existed . i highly recommend this vid . i 've told my 13 year old son about koko the clown- he ca n't wait to get a copy !
i do n't know whether to recommend this movie to the fans of `` tetsuo `` or not . why `` tetsuo `` ? because you can easily label some things about this movie as a very obvious `` tetsuo `` rip - off . the concept is similar , editing is equally frantic and fast - which is good because , aside from making the movie more dynamic , it obscures some flaws caused by low budget and other factors . there is lot more gore , less eroticism and , in the case of `` meatball machine `` , the transformation of human being into a creature that 's partially a machine ( sounds familiar ? ) called `` necroborg `` ( very original ) is caused by slimy little aliens . these slimy little scums from outer space actually use human beings as vessels for their gladiator games that they play with each other . they infest the body , somehow manage to put an insane amount of mechanical parts in it pulling them seemingly out of nowhere and turn it into a killing machine that targets other necroborgs . their aim is to defeat another alien who is in another necroborg , rip it out of the corpse and eat it . all in all , the plot sounds somewhat silly and i did n't expect much , but at the end i actually enjoyed this film . as i said before , this is a low budget flick , but it 's still relatively decent . do n't expect much from actors , they 're mostly not very good , but it can be tolerated . i liked the atmosphere and gore , certain bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited . although the story is not too original , it possesses certain charm - to me at least . 7 out of 10 .
the haunted world of edward d. wood , jr. is n't a particularly good documentary . aesthetically , it 's lackluster and cheap looking , the people in it go off on tangents which make it very unfocused and in-cohesive , but this adds to it 's charm . i say this because it 's a documentary about an oddball that made oddball pictures and surrounded himself with fellow oddballs and , as such , there 's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of misfits . there are some glimpses of insight into both the genius and the ineptness of wood , and the portrayal of both qualities is a credit to the genuineness of the documentary . overall , it 's worth a watch for the wood fan and those of cinema in general , but do n't expect brilliance here . expect a documentary made after wood 's own heart .
madhur bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism today . celebrities party endlessly , they like to be seen at these parties , and to get due exposure in the media . in fact the film would have us believe that this exposure makes celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this . imo there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a `` i need you , you need me '' kind of relationship . however , the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa . anyhow , in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column ( page 3 of the newspaper ) reporter konkana sen sharma . she is shown as this celebrity maker , very popular at the social gatherings . she has a good friend in the gay abhijeet and in the struggling model rohit ( bikram saluja ) . she rooms with an air-hostess  the sassy pearl ( sandhya mridul ) , and a struggling actress - gayatri ( tara sharma ) . the editor of the newspaper is boman irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by atul kulkarni . the movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level . the rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part , the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios , exploitation of power , hunger for media exposure . into all this is layered in homosexuality , a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot , rampant drug use , pedophilia , police `` encounter '' deaths . in light of all this pearl 's desire to have a super rich husband , a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car , the bitching women , all seem benign ills . the film has absolutely excellent acting by konkana sen sharma , atul kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion . but the supporting cast is more than competent ( boman irani is very good ) . this is what saves the film for me . mr. bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash . i wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively . he berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful . we have an item number in the framework of a bollywood theme party , the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a western beat . i hope the next one from madhur bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the hindi film stereotyped ingredients . the film is a brave ( albeit flawed ) effort , certainly worth a watch .
this was fun to watch , spookily atmospheric and effects were pretty good considering they were bang in the middle of world war two . the plot did unravel pretty quickly at the end with the villains getting their comeuppance . it must have been a good one to watch at the local flea pit in the 1940 's when they were facing the biggest threat to their liberty from the nazis - well made with quite a serious message about the dangers to britain from third columnists . but arthur askey was so annoying & unfunny you just wanted him to shut up - well at least i did ! i suppose different tastes in different times but the clowning around became tiresome . if he was playing an annoying little man as part of the script then he succeeded . a good watch and quite short at just over 80 minutes - a good background for older kids too so they have an idea of what train travel in austere times was like ; uncomfortable slow , dirty trains , being thrown off for no reason , surly staff ....
this movie 's origins are a mystery to me , as i only know as much as imdb did before i rented it . i assume that before `` starship troopers '' , `` killshot '' was one of the countless unaired pilots that never made it to network , cable , or otherwise . the new title of `` kill shot '' is comically thrown into the opening sequence , the first of many quick clues that this was not ever intended for the cinema . the quick cuts , cheesy `` melrose place '' music , and short 2-second close-up candid shots of the main actors let you know what you 're in for . and i do n't mind at all . i rented this movie seeing the repackaging that puts casper van dien and denise richards on the cover in front of a volleyball net thinking it would be funny to see them in a movie besides the scifi travesty of starship troopers ( an excellent book , in my opinion , not so hot a movie - but that 's another review ) . after looking it up on imdb , my roommate and i surmised that the pilot was dragged up after the apparent success of troopers and richards own career ( see bond-girl and wild things references here ) . they threw in a sex scene involving a minor character to reach the coveted r-rated status - coveted in suspense video rental sections , that is . in any event , they should have left it unrated if you 're trying to sell it in the suspense/softcore porn section . all in all , it 's entertaining . i hate to spoil the fun of telling you it 's a tv pilot , though . that was the biggest pull while watching it - when you expect a cinematic movie and get a tv show , the differences between them make themselves more clear than usual . would i rent it again ? no . would i watch this tv show ? well , why not - it 's better than baywatch . and their meager attempts at hitting all demographics would have done well back in the mid 90s . token black guy ( who 's gay to avoid the tv taboo of inter-racial dating ) , token asian ( japanese , i assume from the name koji ) more adept at science and computers than talking to women , beautiful , intelligent latina pre-med student who has everything going for her except her family 's bank account - this show probably would have done ok . but as a movie it just cracks me . i gave it a 7 out of 10 , considering what it was and what it was forced to become . it made for a very enjoyable evening , and that 's all i ask of rentals .
the town of royston vasey is a weird , but wonderful place . the characters would be just wrong and too disturbing but the fantastically brilliant writing means that it works , and it works very well . most people will know others with a touch of some characters , but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as tubbs and edward , the stranger-hating owners of the local shop , or the pen-obsessed pauline who treats `` dole scum '' with much contempt.that was only a few of the strange inhabitants . the tv works consists of 3 series and a christmas special . there are references to many horror films , such as the wicker man . a more recent addition to the range of works is a film , the league of gentlemens apocalypse , of which i will not say much but highly recommend . all in all the league of gentlemen is a hilarious comedy show with genius writing and brilliantly bonkers characters . i would definitely say that it is worth watching as you wont regret it !
1 . ) this movie was amazing ! i watched it while i was in the town next to the one where he grew up ! i went and saw the buildings that the story took place in . overall , i loved this movie , one of jake gyllenhaal 's best ! ! also- my favorite parts were the science fair , and all the times with his father . they were so sad , it seemed . homer wanted to follow his dream and his dad did n't seem to care one way or another . that tag line is true . `` sometimes one dream is bright enough to light up the sky . '' 2 . ) the way this movie was shot was impeccable , it was all so believable that it could have been recorded during the 1950 's . dress was accurate and they had their slang down too . definitely recommend this movie !
half a dozen short stories of varying interest enlighten us about life in finland . these stories are interwoven and each contains a scene in which a sonic boom is heard . this indicates that the events depicted happen at the same time . the film begins with a bungy jump which promises some excitement but the early stories are quite low key . the film improves so stick with it . two broken marriages in stories that follow provide plenty of drama while a scene in a hospital gives us a terminally ill patient begging for pain relief . the last moments with his wife are both convincing and moving . while the various scenes of family life take place in finland , the themes are of a general nature wherever you happen to live . collections of short stories are rarely as satisfying as a good tense 90-minute drama .
i 'm one of those people who usually watch programs and keep my feelings about a show private . however , pushing daisies is my exception . i became curious about the program from the commercials that aired which gave glimpses of the premise of the show . i was skeptical about it at first , especially after the finale of six feet under was still in my head . here we go again , i thought . i watched the first , second , third and all the other episodes . wow ! first of all , i thought it took the subject of death and presented in a way that was palatable without being morbid . the characters were engaging and i like the thought of ned the main character not being able to literally touch the love of his life , chuck without the consequences of her dying . most of the characters have a longing for things they ca n't have . besides ned and chuck , olive longs for ned . lily and vivian longs for their niece chuck and emerson is always longing for the monetary rewards from the mysterious deaths they solve . i think the characters are picture perfect and believable . i like how emerson who is black plays off of the rest of the characters since as an african american ; i like the subtle cultural humor that sometimes comes from him . all in all , this visual fairytale is one of the most valuable pieces of entertainment that i 've seen out of the 2007 season . i think the show has enough romance for the romantics and enough who-done-it for the mystery buffs . i just wish the writers would get back to work , so that the show can continue to evolve .
the reason why i say this is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film . i wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me . because alan dobie was a friend of mine , i got to hear about it . i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor . i asked peter collinson , through my agent , whether he might like me to do another draft . i also asked if i could i see my original script because i had lost it . i was told , too late . so i did the only thing i could do under the circumstances and took my name off . i had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay . then i was invited to see the finished film . i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put back on . it 's a beautifully made piece , from a hurriedly written first draft , i expected to be asked to do much more work on it ; perhaps if i had it would n't be so good . i would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is ? i would also love to see the film again , i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in soho .
this is a good movie , but it is not recommended if you do n't like intelligent movies . it 's about two guys that wish that the world would go away , and that 's exactly what they get . the acting is great , the ending was not predictable , and it actually had a good story unlike most movies these days . people complain about the movie being too simple or too boring . i think they should just stick to movies like the toxic avenger ( i actually like b movies ) or the grim adventures of billy and mandy . one note : if you notice this , this has exactly the same actors from cube except four actors . make it two notes : wait after the credits ( trust me on this one ) . enjoy the movie .
this movie , which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driver-less , moving vehicle , has quite the quirky little personality to boot . the cast of seven ( although one girl does n't hang around for the bodycount , which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is ) are all super-hot , as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert ( an odd but effective choice of setting ) , who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck . it predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ( `` the trip '' , `` joy ride '' , `` jeepers creepers '' ) where the killer 's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist . the killer himself is quite creepy , and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in jennifer mcallister ( look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black , while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire , as scanty and stonewashed as it may be ) . director bill crain does some really great things with his camera , some neat tricks on screen , and the cast tries their absolute best . there 's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans , and enough t & a from a couple of the girls to please t & a fans . overall , this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it 's proved quite rare to find on video . highly recommended .
i went to see fever pitch with my mom , and i can say that we both loved it . it was n't the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other , and blah blah blah ... you were n't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together . it was more real , because you saw them through the relationship , rather than the whole movie be about them getting together . people could actually relate to the film , because it did n't seem like extraordinary circumstances , or impossible situations . it was really funny , and i think it was jimmy fallon 's best performance . all in all ... i would definitely recommend it !
this is apparently the second remake of this film , having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918 . and , in so many ways it reminds me of the later film , a yank at oxford . both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both , ultimately , show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency . in this film , william haines is `` tom brown '' and his main rival , `` bob '' is played by frances x. bushman . and , in a supporting role is jack pickford -- always remembered as the brother of mary . of these three , pickford comes off the best , as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom 's pal -- he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game ! all the standard clichés are there and the movie , because it was done so many times before and since , offers few surprises . however , it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing . in my opinion , for a better silent college film , try harold lloyd 's the freshman -- it 's football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown . the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era . another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again ( such as in westpoint and the smart set , among others ) -- and if you 've seen one of these films , you 've seen them all . well made , but certainly not original ! and , because it is just a rehash of his other films , anyone giving the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to see these other films . 4/25/08==i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the 1920 ! ! talk about over-rated ! there are dozens and dozens of better films -- how this film got to be # 1 is anyone 's guess .
darius goes west is a film depicting american belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough . this wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected , but longed to see , what was outside the confines of his lovely city of athens , ga. darius wished to see the ocean . his longtime friends logan , ben and several other good friends decided to make darius ' wish come true . they started small - ben & logan 's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to darius ' condition : duchenne muscular dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great united states . to say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement . they realized darius ' dream and then some . they put their lives on hold while showing love , care and tons of fun to darius while helping darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from dmd . darius went on to volunteer for the red cross - sitting in his chair collecting money ( along with his buddies ) outside a local grocery store . his wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you . give darius and all the guys an oscar - no one else deserves it more . martha sweeney .
`` the grudge '' is a remake of shimizu 's own series of popular japanese horror films . shimizu knows he is not dealing with anything new , so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place : he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride . he uses commonly known clichés associated with ghost stories but shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner . the nonlinear narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives . at the end , all i can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience ( the same way a comedy is to make people laugh ) , this movie succeeded with flying colors . i watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one . it probably does n't play as well in your living room .
after seeing this film at the sf independent film festival , i could n't wait to hear about how to get a copy . jim mckay gave a talk ( q & a ) about the film afterward which presented his ironic situation : how to get distribution for a film which portrays minorities ( women , non-whites ) working on resolving controversial issues ( teen pregnancy , teen motherhood , racial identity , single-mother households ) , and how to write a faithful script on all of these topics being a mid-thirties white male . the multi-racial , multi-gendered audience of mostly-adults raved about the film 's fantastic storyline , detailed characters , and fantastic portrayal of `` real teen life . '' most of the teens , however , had left the building -- leading me to think this is a film best seen by adults with kids , as a starting point for discussion rather than , as many adults there felt , `` a film teens should see because it 's about them . '' hence , distribution questions -- how do we get our hands on it ? the internet ( retail ) would be a great path -- this is a film that will be buried , like `` pups '' or other radical modern teen films -- and mckay seemed responsive . as for his credits as a writer/director , mckay was _extremeley_ sensitive and detailed in his work -- allying himself to the crown heights neighborhood in which the film is set , working with actors to portray characters in their own vision of what they think should be -- with the results being disarmingly realistic .
disney , the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages , has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse . such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years . films like `` tarzan '' and `` the emperor 's new groove '' have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of disney 's past and into new , uncharted territory . `` atlantis '' is the boldest step yet , but we have to remember : this is still disney . the first ever serious film to come out of disney 's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it 's so serious it makes it into pg territory . perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer . but despite the more mature subject matter , this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with , not just mature audiences , so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand , but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of `` the little mermaid '' et al . so what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot , unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie . ultimately , this is an action film about atlantis , not about the exposition preceding it , so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency . suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly , you 're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood ! if you want epic levels of detail in the plot , turn to james cameron 's `` titanic '' . both films feature a boat in some manner . and let 's talk about love , shall we ? yes , as with a lot of films , the lead male ( one milo thatch , a bumbling archaeologist ) and lead female ( kida , the clichéd atlantian princess ) are set to fall in love with each other . but what i found was not as clichéd as i was expecting . by film 's end , for once , the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued . there 's various points in the film where the attraction grows , but it 's just not in the ballpark of , say , `` the little mermaid '' ( a good thing ) . you may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film . correct . you have your leading hero and heroine , backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition , all being given their moments during the film . numerous other characters appear , take up the few minutes of screentime , then disappear . it does n't take a genius to do the maths  a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals , and with a considerable cast , has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent . so what does it rely on ? clichés , and lots of them . every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before . you have the bumbling scientist , the attractive princess , the square-jawed colonel , the rich eccentric , the maniacal sleazebag , the russian femme fatale  need i go on ? i do n't know why this got to anyone  i found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing . alright , this is meant to be a serious flick , but do you really expect disney to give up every single trait of their history ? at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue , and sometimes it even is a little inspired . but in the end it 's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake . the cgi animation is truly amazing in places , and does n't dwarf the characters , which was a flaw that let the recent `` titan a.e . '' down . speaking of characters , disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs , bringing an anime style to the film . infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime , much more so than any previous disney outing . this resulted in a conflict with fans of the japanese anime , `` nadia '' , for the film 's overall similarities with said cartoon series . having not seen this anime , i ca n't comment . with picture , there is sound . gary rydstrom heads up the sound team , and what a soundtrack ! from the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat . james newton howard treats us to a dynamic musical score , which compliments the film in every way , never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it . perhaps i missed the point of what the creators intended . to me , the film conveys that it 's an adventure thrill ride , albeit with a more serious tone than any disney film before it . if you do n't like the clichéd tongue-in-cheek attitude , then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight . heck , at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other disney efforts ( * cough * hercules * cough * ) . this is a positive , 10 out of 10 review , from someone who was blown away by this film . i always suspend my disbelief with any animated film  after all , the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium . so sit back , enjoy the ride , and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film .

this is one of the greatest movies ever maybe even the greatest movie ever . i had forgotten about the movie for about 12 years . until i saw an add on tv for adgth and it brought back fond memories of me watching it when i was a little kid . and when i watched it a few nights ago i became addicted to the movie . usually i do n't like animated family movies but this one is special it is the perfect family movie . the ending of the movie always touches my heart and saddens me very much but that is what makes this movie amazing better than all of the garbage that is coming out for kid movies today . i mean the movie is g rated and it is about 2 dogs who are involved with gambling , there is a lot of smoking , drinking , murder , death and hell depicted in the movie . which i believe makes the movie from good to great . i mean movies today do n't bring reality to kids and in this movie they did . rip judith barsi & dom deluise
i suppose i always felt that hotel du nord was studio-bound , the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location . but no problem - it 's still a much underrated lovely composition from marcel carne . the plot seems a bit choppy at times , as if they were making it up as they went along , but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end . the money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue , but it 's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted . are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-war france or simply idiots ? suicide pacts are fairly common ; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools ? arletty played the part of prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway ! i 've only seen a few films with jouvet - he is the most impressive invention as pimp in hdn - my trouble is shallow : every time i see his face i think of sonnie hale in evergreen ! a remarkably atmospheric , well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place . annabella and aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple ; francois ( heurtebise ) perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man . all in all : wonderful .
if your a hard core freddy fan then you might not like it . this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series . not much to see here . the only reason it holds it self up is the back story on freddy . the one thing that is always great in nightmare movies are the death scenes . but the death scenes were very crappy in this . the visual effects were great and the acting was ok but the back story was excellent . basically freddy 's story comes full circle in this . i have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws : 1 . a nightmare on elm street . ( 8/10 ) 2 . freddy 's dead : the final nightmare . ( 7/10 ) 3 . a nightmare on elm street 4 : the dream master . ( 7/10 ) 4 . a nightmare on elm street 3 : the dream warriors . ( 7/10 ) 5 . a nightmare on elm street 5 : the dream child . ( 6/10 ) 6 . a nightmare on elm street 2 : freddy 's revenge . ( 3/10 ) i recommend it if you enjoy the series . this is were freddy is fully explained but thats all there is . next on my list wes cravens new nightmare . ( 7/10 )
clara bow 's beauty and wonderful appeal are the chief reason to watch this film . `` hula '' is not quite up to par with clara 's best films but it is still enjoyable . she dances , she rides her horse , and pursues the man that she loves . this film is just over an hour in length and was directed by future oscar winner victor fleming ( gone with the wind ) .the film moves quickly and clara bow has lots of screen time . if you like clara , i would reccomend `` hula . ''
ok where do i begin ? ... this movie changed my life ! the plot was seamless . james cahill has out done himself . initially after a first viewing i was disappointed that i had n't seen it on the silver screen . however this was before exploring the dvd 's many features ! ! ! ! oh my god jakes cahill 's commentary of the film was almost as flawless as his acting . he told of industry secrets used in the film that you only get with experience . i was so impressed by the other actors . the scene where the security guard is talking to the girl in the hallway , reminded me of some of my favorite blue ( pornographic ) movies . i am certainly with gangsta when he expresses his disappointment with no sequel . i am still blown away with each viewing of the martial arts skills involved , matched only by the sign indicating the location of the library at the school ... and possibly the guy playing a retard ! all in all a timeless classic and the best film to come out of europe in years ! where my oscars at dawn ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
this is one of the funniest movies that i have seen this year . the people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted . it is a beautiful thing . there were a lot of quality one-liners . this movie blew uncle sam out of the water ( it was made by tha same people , i think )
ghost story ( the tv movie -- 1972 ) was the pilot for the nbc series . the movie was well-written and well-acted and , i thought , when the 1972-73 tv season started , if the tv series is half as good as the movie , then nbc has a winner . ( i wish this film was available on video ! ! ) the series was a colossal disappointment -- even with william castle as exec . producer . if , however , you have a chance to see the original tv movie , ghost story , check it out . you wo n't be disappointed .
to finally see what many consider to be the greatest women-in-prison film of all time , i felt like i had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds . boy , it sure contained the elements i expected , and delivered so much more . a constant i 'm discovering in these films is the toughness and grit of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their threshold , tolerance , and resolve ( .. not to mention sanity ) being tested by their superiors . while most of them were hired for the way they look naked , because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements , something else emerges , other attributes , such as attitude and guts , that i ultimately respond to . this , as you may know all too well , was demme 's debut for his mentor roger corman , and he provides the target audience with exactly what they desire while putting his own stamp on the proceedings . for instance , there are bizarre dreams certain characters have which define their current psychological states ( .. there 's a particular number featuring warden barbara steele where she reminded me of alex de large of a clockwork orange ) . the film has female prisoners planning a daring escape , tired of the crazed antics of their wheel-chair bound warden and her nutty prison doc , randolph ( warren miller ) . juanita brown is maggie , the tough , sassy sister who is fed up with the environment and will do whatever it takes to get out . she 's the one all the girls fear to cross . erica gavin is jacqueline wilson , the newest prisoner who was busted by police and sentenced for the murder of a cop , unwilling to give up the names of those she was involved with . roberta collins is belle , a serial kleptomaniac , best pals with pandora ( ella reid ) . belle becomes the obsession of randolph who promises superintendent mcqueen ( steele ) that through a surgical procedure he can remove her violent tendencies . drugging her up , randolph takes nude pictures and sodomizes her , whimpering like a little girl due to his own mental deficiencies while hugging her naked body in his arms . cheryl rainbeaux smith is lavelle , in prison for life for murdering a scumbag whose relative was a senator . lavelle receives work in randolph 's office and is the one responsible for relating his dirty antics to pandora . demme effectively builds the movie to the expected finale as a planned break-out , using those behind the various traumas inflicted on the prisoners as hostages , with gunfire erupting . i was quite impressed with the photographic work of long time demme collaborator , cinematographer tak fujimoto , as he is able to establish some visually arresting moments within the cramped confines of the prison , cells and rooms , not an easy task . the prison is appropriately crummy and the girls , despite being quite attractive , look the part of desperate inmates longing , yearning from the very pits of their souls , to escape such horrid entrapment . steele is superb as the warden , understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far , candidly able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint .. notice how she works her glasses and settles herself without blowing her top particularly when certain behaviors she has contempt for push her teetering to the edge . cale 's bluesy score is incredibly depressing , while also casting a wink to the audience that the movie is still fun-and-games .. i think cale 's score mirrors demme 's handling of the material . cale and demme 's partnership is an uncanny alliance that presents the setting as a sad , isolating , oppressive place , while , almost simultaneously , showcasing a humorous tone that permeates due to the colorful characters thanks in part to the personalities of the cast . my favorite scene happens outside the prison , as two of our girls ( .. joining forces with a third ) interrupt a bank robbery already in progress .. the kicker is it was a bank they were planning to rob ! as you might expect , you get naked women in showers , prisoner in solitary , a cat fight , shootouts , attempted escapes which go awry , and other exploitative elements ( .. such as a horrifying shock therapy session , not to exclude the shocking aforementioned sequence where the screwy doc takes advantage of belle ) . interesting enough , demme relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension , understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making .
as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves , we perhaps should n't expect too much from broken in disc form . and yet what 's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation . with regards to the latter , the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non-anamorphic transfer . otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio , demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected . indeed , given ferrari 's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact . the same is also true of the soundtrack . here we are offered both dd2.0 and dd5.1 mixes and whilst i 'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the `` original '' , the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior . indeed , though the dd5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilizes the score , both are equally fine and free of technical flaws . as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them . take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you 'll notice numerous commentaries , loads of featurettes and various galleries . indeed , given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary , there really is little to discuss . the 'anatomy of a stunt ' featurette , for example , is exactly what it claims to be , and the same goes for the rest of pieces . as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of broken 's pre-production , production and post-production . and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of ' , in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view . of the various pieces , then , it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion . then again , there 's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks . the one involving the actors is overly jokey and does n't take the film too seriously . ferrari 's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing . and the technical ones are , well , extremely technical . of course , we also get some crossover with what 's been covered elsewhere on the discs , but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome . indeed , all in all , a fine extras package .
i like films that do n't provide the typical `` happy ending , '' and that 's my main reason for my liking of this movie . alice marano ( danes ) and her best friend darlene ( beckinsale ) are arrested in thailand for narcotics smuggling after a tip anonymously phoned in to the thai authorities . the film does a solid job of keeping viewers guessing as to whether ( or which ) of the girls was involved , and bill pullman is perfect as their sleazy lawyer . jacqueline kim turns in a terrific performance as his more kind , magnanimous wife , yon , who is also an attorney . i wish the girls had been abused more in the prison , as another commenter has suggested , as i 've heard that thai prisons can be quite brutal . where this film grabs me , however , is its ending . alice subjects herself to a sentence of 96 years in total so that darlene can be pardoned , and we ( the viewers ) realize that they are both innocent . any film that defies my expectation of the ending wins extra points with me , and this well-acted drama is certainly deserving .
i think lion king 1 1/2 is one of the best sequels ever as if not the best out of the three lion king movies ! in the movie timon and pumbaa tell us where they came from and having trouble fitting in with others such as timon having trouble digging tunnels with other meercats ! timon and pumbaa journey off into finding their dream place and find it and soon find it and also simba who they raise but soon they must choose between their dream place or helping simba face his evil uncle scar and proclaim his right as the lion king of pride rock ! filled with wonderful new characters like timon 's ma ( julie kavner ) and uncle max ( jerry stiller ) . i think my favorite character was uncle max because he was very funney and was voiced by a funney comedian jerry stiller the father of ben stiller . disney was smart to cast stiller in that role ! filled with wonderful characters , animation , and story and music lion king 1 1/2 is in my opinion the best of any sequel and better than simba 's pride even though i will admit i really did like that one too ! lion king 1 1/2 is a great disney sequel the whole family can enjoy ! it 's got a good story and is very funney ! 10 out of 10 !
i do find it a bit overrated . maybe it 's just because i 've never seen a subtitled version ( dubbing stinks ! ) , but i just do n't get into it like a lot of other people do . the finale is really great though as jackie trashes a mall , a scene that plays in my head every time i go shopping !
a great addition to anyone 's collection . 12 monkeys is a movie you do n't see every day . it has excellent actors to go with a excellent story . this is not a normal role for bruce willis but he holds the role like he holds john mcclane . the virus-kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a fresh new direction on it . a man ( bruce ) is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind . the actors in this were awesome . i must give a mention to brad pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient james cole ( bruce ) meets in a mental hospital . the director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus . the animals seen in the virus world made it feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground facilities . this movie was excellent and must see and also its a must own . i very much highly recommend it . 10/10
now here 's a film straight out of my childhood , my family used to taped ; but it kind of got tapped over and losted over the years . now i was fortunate to watch the whole film on youtube.com ; i had love this wonderful film when i watched it as kid , and after watching again ( online ) , i still do today . my favorite song from the movie is `` candy hearts and paper flowers '' ( i will always remember that sweet song forever ) . i was surprised when i looked at the opening credits ( on who animated who ) , that some of the animators date back to 1930s ( wow ! that 's like 47 years ) .
well you take o.j . simpson as a all american soldier turned all american bus driver who decides to rescue his passengers on his own just incase no one else is going to and arte johnson in an absolutely straight role as the tour guide who does n't know what to do but does n't want to admit they are in trouble and combine it with lorenzo lamas as one of three baby faced bad boys who intend to kidnap an heiress and leave a busload of people to die on the dessert and you have got to have action , plot twists and a lot of drama . everyone was good but seeing lamas as the baddest of the bad boys really blew my mind . he was much too believable as the overbearing bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heiress but rape the women and humiliate the guy who tried to stop him . this was evidently long before he cultivated his good guy image . and believe me a 20 year old lorenzo in tight jeans you really do n't want to miss !
this film caught me by surprise . my friend told me that this movie was a `` chick flick . '' boy , was he wrong ! this movie has a great family appeal , with no sex scenes like _other_ movies . jake gyllenhaal does an excellent job in homer hickam 's shoes . the supporting cast is great , as well . science , coming-of-age , family quarrels , a great train scene ... this film has it all . the soundtrack is good , although the score is presented quite choppily . the 50s music kicks the movie over the edge of greatness . the dvd is definitely worth its weigh in coal . replay value is great - i 've seen it quite a few times already .
powers booth is hypnotic as cult leader jim jones who led his peoples temple followers from 1953 until 1978 when he led them in a mass suicide in 1978 where over 900 died . a very well done movie which may seem a little dated due to the 70s time period but well worth the time 8 of 10
ok . i admit . i 'm one of those nerds who have spent all to many hours with my beloved dvd player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series . star trek ( next generation ) was my first space date , and since then i 've switched partners regularly . i 've seen'em all , it seems , and my favorites are « lexx » , « farscape » and the new « battlestar galactica » , in other words : the newest , state of the art space operas . but , i also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones , the cheap ones , like the magnificent four seasoned bbc show « blakes7 » . here , the budgets are smaller than hobbits , the special effects seem to be made on a commodore 64 , but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor , the acting dead serious and at times even high class ? but why do they always speak english in the space future ? because this is not the future , it 's fantasy for kids . still , it can be irritating at times . me , being a norwegian , have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series , like science fiction , for scandinavian viewers . i never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened . but it did , actually , once , and even in my own homeland , norway . i was two years old when the so called fjernsynsteatret ( tv theater section ) of our national public service channel nrk produced this three episode version of blindpassasjer ( the stowaway ) . when i first heard of it , i was not surprised of the fact that until this day , the show has only been screened once in norway , making it impossible for me to actually see it . it went on swedish , danish and finnish television also , in it 's time , but that was a long time ago . there have been no video or dvd release of it , not a surprise either , and when it was screened on an art house cinema , this happened in bergen , a city far far away from oslo ( where i live ) . and then there 's another fact about « blindpassasjer » that did n't surprise me , that it was written by the two norwegian authors tor åge bringsværd and jon bing ( bing & bringsværd ) . this duo basically introduced the scifi genre to norwegians in the seventies ; they published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose . in my opinion , bringsværd is the most interesting of the two writers , and has written several great and entertaining novels , masterpieces even , some of them hilarious , such as « bazar » and « syvsoverskens dystre frokost » . no other than this guy , also an acclaimed dramatist , could construct the script of « blindpassasjer » . when i finally got to watch it , it was because a strange swede who recorded the three episodes on vcr in the 80 's , eventually managed to transform it to dvd and give it to me . he was a nice bloke . so i sat down and watched it , with swedish subtitles , bad sound and some scrapes and errors ; but the thing came through and i was surprised that i eventually came to love it . the exterior scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than the ones in blakes7 , and the credit goes to caprino studios ( who made the famous flåklypa grand prix ) , and the interior of the marco polo ( the space ship ) works better than i 'd expected . the acting is typically theatrical , but it works better than when they play ibsen , to put it mildly , and bjørn floberg carries his role solidly , as does trini lund . the legendary actress henny moan delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre , but this is an ensemble play , and i 'm happy to say that ola b. johannesen carries his mustache with nobility , and marit østbye is a really hot space chic of my standards . but is it really that good ? well , one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending , the pretentious criticism of « modern society » , but yes , it 's , well , not really really really fantastic , but charming , cool , nostalgic and pleasant . one and a half hour of classic norwegian scifi .
much like the comedy duo of its title , `` the sunshine boys '' has become a forgotten classic 30-odd years later . it 's hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s . this makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film , perhaps the best neil simon ever wrote . walter matthau plays willy clark , once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as lewis and clark , now a bitter 73-year-old solo act who ca n't get a job in a potato chip commercial . his nephew and agent ben ( richard benjamin ) is sure he can get work if willy will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner al lewis ( george burns ) for an abc-tv celebration of show business nostalgia . nostalgia is what `` sunshine boys '' has going for it in spades , right from the start when a series of 1920s film clips showcasing various entertainers from long ago flickers before us to the accompaniment of cole porter 's `` be a clown '' . then there 's the film 's present-day setting in manhattan , where flared trousers and wide polyester ties abound . the periods collide in willy 's glorious mess of a manhattan apartment , where framed photos and cartoons of long-dead celebrities stare out from the walls at lurid tabloid headlines and empty zabar grocery bags . if you were alive in the 1970s like me , you might even feel like you were in that apartment . willy clearly has been living there too long . he 's sleeping in front of the television when the kettle in the other room boils . willy wakes up and picks up the phone . `` hello , who is this ? '' a pause . `` never mind , it 's the tea . '' old men living alone can be sad material in almost anyone else 's hands , but simon 's deft wit and unerring feeling for character turns this adaptation of his 1972 stage hit into comedy gold . the amazing thing about `` the sunshine boys '' is how much it rubs your noses in willy 's almost existential condition without turning you off at all . `` 89 years old and just like that , he dies of nothing ' '' willy says of one old songwriting friend , before deciding the man probably died from writing a song that rhymed `` lady '' with `` baby '' . burns won an oscar for his understated performance as the gentle but steely lewis , but it 's matthau who brings this one home , his make-up and proud but ragged bearing really selling you on the idea he was already 73 when he made this . willy is obnoxious in the extreme , fully deserving ben 's description `` crazy freakin ' old man '' , but you root for him throughout , enjoying his small victories even when they come at the cost of others ' patience . his lines kill you , too , especially when he 's trying to kill lewis , for whom the tv reunion turns out to be a bad idea . `` you 're out of touch ! '' willy tells lewis at one point . `` i 'm still in demand . i 'm still hot ! '' `` if this room was on fire you would n't be hot , '' lewis replies . director herbert ross shoots everything in a very casual and understated way , with low lighting and mid-range shots even in emotional moments so as to leave room for the comedy and the film 's overall zen message of grace through quiet acceptance . you never get the feeling you are watching a movie , one of `` the sunshine boys '' many charms , and ross 's direction , like the acting of the three principals , goes a long way toward achieving that end . comedy is hard , especially when the subjects are people watching life pass them by , but `` the sunshine boys '' makes it all seem a pleasure , because , for us watching , it is .
i found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand . a few things are inappropriate for the kiddies , but just a few . othewise , `` the grinch '' ( jim carrey ) cracks so many jokes you ca n't keep up with them all , ranging from sexual to cultural to insider-hollywood to racial . the film is very colorful and looks great on dvd . the little girl in here , `` cindy lou who '' ( taylor momsen ) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view . anthony hopkins ' voice is pleasing , too , so having his narrate this elevates the movie further . his rhymes are fun to hear . i saw this in the theater , though it was `` fair , '' but on dvd , it was far better . i 've seen in three times and it got better each time .
richard willaims is an animation god . he was hampered in directing this film by the producer . the final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story , but some amazing moments of animation ( like emery hawkins ' `` greedy '' ) . joe raposo 's repetitive music does n't help either . it was made in wide screen so the vhs does n't show it in all it 's glory , let 's hope for a letterboxed dvd someday . still it 's worth watching for some eye popping animation .
simply one of the best ever ! richard brooks ' adaptation of truman capote 's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement . stunning black and white cinematography ( that should have won an oscar ) , a haunting quincy jones score and tremendous performances by robert blake and scott wilson as the oddly-matched killers . this film was 0 for 4 at the academy awards and was n't even nominated for best picture while dr. doolittle was . go figure ! although you do n't get to know the clutter family as well as you do in the book , it was a good decision to focus more on perry and dick and the pain-staking process of tracking these guys down . john forsythe is also impressive as alvin dewey . there are simply no flaws in this one . 10 out of 10 . best performance = scott wilson with r. blake a close second . highly recommended !
i was adopted at birth and certainly did not have the problems antwone fisher had in the movie , but i still share some of the emotions and this movie really helped to bring them out and force me to deal with them . it even caused me to realize that i do have a `` missing piece '' and i am going to seek out my birthparents now . i cried for almost a day after i saw this the first time . antwone 's confrontation with his birthmother juxtaposed with his father 's family 's reaction to his sudden appearance are powerful for those of us who do n't know what will happen if we find our birth parents . and his self-confidence and self affirmations to his mother and against the abusers of his past were so powerful . i could really identify with this and my need to tell people `` yeah , i was put aside by my parents when i was born . but another set of parents picked me up and loved me . and now i am a success ! '' it also helped my wife understand me and our adopted children , who did go through tragic experiences before they came to our home . and it helped me to realize just how messed up our social system is . if you remember reading the story last year about the foster kid in florida who was `` lost '' and then the `` miranda & ashley '' story in oregon city where scf ignored multiple sexual abuse complaints about the man who ultimately killed them and the week this movie was released , yet another story in new jersey of three kids who were ignored by the system . one died . the state apparently thought the home they were in was ok because the guardian was employed ( as a stripper ) and `` only occasionally '' used heroin ! there are just so many issues that are brought out in this movie - and they are dealt with so well by the script and by the acting that antwone fisher should be a `` best picture '' nominee for sure . no matter if you are adopted or not , it is a heart-tugger that ca n't be ignored by anyone concerned about children in our society .
pearl s.buck was a brilliant author that was a first american lady won nobel prize in literature in 1938 and received her prize with enrico fermi an italian physit . she wrote this romance in 1931 which was a second one after her first novel ( east wind and west wind ) in 1930 and her beginning in literature was fantastic upon her premier novels . she won in 1935 ( pulitzer prize ) in literature on her eternal novel ( the good earth ) which made a brilliant panorama on the life of chinese peasant ( wung lung ) and his wife ( o-lane ) and their efforts to face the hardness of hard positions in their earth to reach for their big fortune by their shoulders . paul muni succeeded in this role as chinese peasant that he prepared himself in this role upon his sittings with chinese people in san francisco in their town to be chinese exactly as a real and true . shara reiner succeeded in her role as ( o-lane ) by this brilliant evidence that she won an academy awarded as a best actress in 1937 .
`` kolchak : the night stalker '' is a hugely entertaining tv series in which a pushy , sarcastic , forty-something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural ( and occasionally extraterrestrial ) forces . based on a very popular pair of tv movies featuring the kolchak character , this series died a quick death in the mid-1970s due to low ratings , but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today . but will the average modern-day viewer be able to dig kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead ? that 's actually a tough question to answer fairly . detractors of this series tend to argue that it 's formulaic and hopelessly dated . on the other hand , fans argue that it 's cleverly written , well-acted , and sometimes genuinely spooky . and me ? i 've got a foot in both camps . i thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of kolchak on dvd recently , though i can plainly see that the series has major flaws . i 'll address the question of kolchak being `` formula '' fiction first . now , i think we can all agree that most tv shows have formulas - just about every episode of columbo unfolds according to the same pattern , for example . repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself ; in fact , critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy , and actively seek out , repetitive entertainment . however , the problem with kolchak is that its formula is simply too rigid - it 's too repetitive even by the most generous standards . in almost every episode , kolchak investigates a murder , and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster . he tries to publish a story about said monster , but his editor vincenzo blocks him , always on the grounds that kolchak does n't have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work . and , alas , kolchak is also obstructed by the police . so , in the end , kolchak does some independent research on the monster , figures out how to kill it ... and then kills it . without ceremony , or reward , or writing a big story about it . you can see where this ever-so-strict formula might get tiresome , right ? i 'm particularly mystified by vincenzo - if kolchak 's always raving about monsters , and vincenzo never believes it ... well , then , why does n't vincenzo fire kolchak , or have him committed ? that 's what any normal boss would do . but the series eschews such realism and prefers to keep vincenzo and kolchak as comical antagonists . as a result , many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable - though they are also quite funny . the very best episodes of kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula , however , usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist . these select episodes are good enough that i think they 're largely immune to typical criticisms of the series . some of my favorites include : horror in the heights - an episode that 's noteworthy for being grimy , inventive and socially aware . kolchak 's dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge . though it adheres closely to the kolchak formula , the script ( written by hammer studios veteran jimmy sangster ) is remarkably literate , and it delves deeply into the monster 's backstory . the devil 's platform - a possible inspiration for the `` omen '' films , this episode stands out to me because the villain - a very young tom skerritt - tempts kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies ( and , in so doing , reveals a lot about the reporter 's character . ) firefall - this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans , but i enjoyed it because it 's got a great red herring and a really creepy , almost unstoppable-seeming monster . though i 've singled out these three episodes for praise , i 'd say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least . for my money , there are only two complete turkeys in the 20-episode run : primal scream , which is about monkey-men running rampant in chicago , and the sentry , which features the dumbest-looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment ( and this assessment is coming from a lifelong doctor who and godzilla fan ! ) on balance , then , this is a good series . a little repetitive , a little cheesy perhaps , but it has elements of greatness . even during the weaker episodes , darren mcgavin 's wonderful performance as the caustic , world-weary , endlessly funny kolchak truly shines . he carries the series effortlessly , in a way that , for example , sarah michelle gellar never managed on `` buffy . '' mcgavin was one great character actor , and this series is worth watching for him alone .
fabulous , fantastic , probably disney 's best musical adventure . i have loved this film for over 35 years because it is so imaginative , clever and fun . even despite the silly `` flying bed '' scenes , the other scenes and dialog are magical and funny . could they have picked anyone better than angela lansbury to play eglantine ? i can not think of anyone more suited to the role . remaking this classic would be as stupid as remaking mary poppins . david tomlinson , though he had few quality movie roles , absolutely shines in this adventure . he was a comic genius who is often forgotten nowadays . blustering , prim and proper englishman -- nobody could really do slapstick and pull it off as gracefully as he does . it would be tragic to remake this film because tomlinson has been deceased for a few years and nobody could step into his shoes and do his character justice . the dancing nightgowns and armor have a magical aura about them that other movies with witches just do n't capture . i particularly enjoy the parts where the germans invade eglantine 's house and she must defend it in any way she can . bobbing along , bobbing along on the bottom of the beautiful briny , sea . richard and robert sherman outdid themselves on the musical numbers . all of them are fantastic and worth remembering , portobello road being one of my favorites . a great film that still holds up today ! !
warning : does contain spoilers . open your eyes if you have not seen this film and plan on doing so , just stop reading here and take my word for it . you have to see this film . i have seen it four times so far and i still have n't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film . that is all i am going to say because if you have not seen this film , then stop reading right now . if you are still reading then i am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think . i remember my grade 11 english teacher quite well . his name was mr. krisak . to me , he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you were n't all too keen on . if we did n't like shakespeare , then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it . our class room was never a room , it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time . this was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds . i begin this review of vanilla sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind , like the phone number of a long lost best friend , and it finally made some sense to me after watching the matrix . now if i did n't know better , i would have thought that the wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher mr. krisak . but giving them the benefit of the doubt , we 'll assume it was n't him . but that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable . he had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real . show me how you can tell that you are real . this got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that i 'm sure you can imagine . everything from pain , to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real . after every scenario that we gave him , he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless . `` what if you are nothing but someone else 's dream ? '' what if you were someone else 's dream ? what a messed up question that is . this was a question/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago , before the astronomical use of the internet and rapid advancement of computers . how possible could it seem back then ? but if you look at today 's technology , now ask yourself , what it you were a part of someone else 's dream . another brilliant but surreal film this year , david lynch 's mulholland drive explored similar areas . but vanilla sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to . in short this is one film that will literally ( if you let it ) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you . open your eyes . tom cruise plays david aames , a young , hot shot , righteous , full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines . he inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy , his board of governers , the seven dwarfs , think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth . they feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them . early in the film we meet one of david 's gorgeous toys named julie gianni , played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by cameron diaz . david and julie play a good game , both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous , committed relationship . this is the type of relationship commensurate with david 's other flings he 's had in the sexual prime of his life . and although both talk a good game , we can tell that only one is really telling the truth . next we meet brian shelby , played with a stroke of genius by kevin smith 's good buddy jason lee . brian is writing a book that david is going to publish but they are also very good friends . this is something that david has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film . brian has one famous line that he keeps telling david over and over again . and that is `` the sweet ai n't so sweet without the bitter . '' he goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two . at david 's huge birthday bash , ( so huge that the likes of steven spielberg wish him a happy birthday ) brian enters with his date , sofia sorrano , played of course by penelope cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress . this is a bash by invite only and at first david and sofia seem intrigued with one another . and in typical david fashion , despite his best friend being there , he begins to flirt with sofia . to complicate things , julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on david . david then spends the night with sofia , but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another . there is no hanky panky . the next day , as david is leaving sofia 's apartment , he is greeted by julie , who offers him a ride and from there ....... well , i think we have all seen the commercials . that is all i will really say about the plot , because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception . we are introduced to a character played by kurt russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze . there is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life . this is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us , but it does n't end there . like many movies seem to thrive on today , this film has a secret . sixth sense may have began this craze , but look even further back and you can maybe thank angel heart for starting the craze . regardless of how it originated , vanilla sky has one of it 's own surreptitious gut busters . and what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through . i have seen this film four times and every time it has been because i want to see if there is something more i can pick up , something more i can understand . to be able to work your mind in the theater , to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film . all of the ersatz so called `` best pictures of the year '' have been good but nothing spectacular . they lack substance . a beautiful mind was intriguing but flat , the royal tenenbaums was interesting but uneven . vanilla sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it . i know this film has received mixed reviews but i just think that those who do n't like it do n't quite understand it . this is what film making is supposed to be like . this is what a film is supposed to do to you . it is supposed to make you feel something . most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces . this one is n't . 10 out of 10 the best film of the year . i would love to see this get nominated for best picture and i would love to see cruz up for best actress , diaz for best supporting , cruise for best actor and jason mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor . cameron crowe should there as well . none of this may come to pass , and that is a shame . this is one film that should not be missed . and on a final note , i am quite sure mr. krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question . can you prove you are real ? or are we just a figment of someone 's imagination ? are we artificially transplanted for someone else 's bemusement ? this is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers . and i 'm sure that is just fine with him . open your eyes
what we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that , while perhaps lacking in substance , still provides great entertainment throughout it 's running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do . i saw this film principally because it was directed by john dahl - a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as the last seduction , rounders and roadkill . i figured that if this film was up to standard of what i 've already seen from the director , it would be well worth watching - and red rock west is certainly a film that dahl can be proud of . the plot focuses on the overly moral michael ; a man travelling across america looking for work . he ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in red rock county - only catch is that the job is to murder a man 's wife . he 's been mistaken for a killer named lyle , but instead of doing the job ; he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway . however , his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real lyle turns up ... john dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road ; he did it three years earlier with kill me again , and again almost a decade on from this film with roadkill . it 's not hard to see why dahl chooses this sort of location , as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one . dahl also provides his film with a 'film noir ' like atmosphere , as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters . the acting is largely very good , with nicholas cage doing an excellent job in the lead role , and getting a-class support from lara flynn boyle , j.t . walsh and , of course , dennis hopper ; who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance . it has to be said that the second half of the film is n't as gripping as the first , but red rock west certainly is never boring and the way that dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it . overall , red rock west is a film that you 're unlikely to regret watching . it 's thrilling throughout , and you ca n't ask for much more than that !
composed , elegant carol ( marvelously played by the beautiful rebecca brooke ) , her nice husband eddie ( likable david houseman ) , carol 's wacky , constantly eating best gal pal anna ( delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable chris jordan ) , and anna 's hunky , amorous husband pete ( a typically fine eric edwards ) are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other . their usual routine gets disrupted when carol 's lonely , repressed , but still alluring widow mother jennifer ( a superbly moving performance by the lovely jennifer welles ) drops by for a visit . pretty soon jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers ' blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle , with everyone except carol eager to seduce her . writer/director joe sarno concocts a sharp , engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild'n'easy 70 's sexual revolution ; sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother/daughter incest subplot . moreover , sarno elicits uniformly first-rate acting from the bang-up cast : welles and brooke are both exceptional , with excellent support from edwards , jordan , houseman , arlana blue as flaky new age sex therapist shandara , and erica eaton as saucy neighbor mrs. fields . better still , all the women are extremely hot and enticing ; welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence . the sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit , but never raunchy or tedious . stephen colwell 's bright , polished cinematography and jack justis ' bouncy , melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective . recommended viewing for sarno fans .
and that 's why historic/biographic movies are so important to all of us , moreover when they are so well done , like this one ! before i saw `` the young victoria '' , i knew a few things about queen victoria , but in the end i got much more knowledge about it . emily blunt is simply great as victoria ( who would guess that ! ) and she probably will get a nomination at this years oscar 's . personally , i 'm cheering for her ... for technical issues , i am pleased to say that is a very successful production , with wonderful art direction/set decoration and , of course , like it was expected to be , a terrific periodic costume design ! the one drawback is that i want to see more and know more about this interesting queen , but foremost , incredible woman and mother ! bravo : 9 out of 10 !
i bought the video rather late in my collecting and probably would have saved a lot of money if i bought it earlier . it invariably supersedes anything else on those `` cosmo 's moon '' nights . cher and olympia certainly deserve their awards but this is really a flawless ensemble performance of a superb screenplay . what ? you do n't know what a `` cosmo 's moon '' is ?
not sure if this counts as a spoiler or not , so beware : just a small but crucial thing to watch for , an intriguing possibility : the boys steal a green citroen at one point , for a joy ride , and return it to the owner having done purposeful and vengeful hidden damage to the car , hoping that the owner will crash . is it the very same car they steal much later from the picnicking family ? we know the original owner sold it . they drive off at the end on a dangerous road , one which i understand has been closed to all but pedestrians for the last ten years . a whole new slant to the end of the film . on another matter , this film could have been called `` scent of a woman '' . i do n't recall another film , certainly not american , that treats the scent of a woman in such a frank and open manner , much like the `` nose '' of a fine bordeaux .
the magnetism radiated from elvira , drawing her legions of devoted admirers , has a primordial quality . with her lengthy , well-toned figure , large-bust , innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang , the character of elvira has a universal and timeless appeal . as an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling , it is evident that the elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest . as initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her , she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level : a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning , boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun . she symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town . the other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons . in the end , however , her film can not move pass its more campy ingredients . the end result is that while elvira is infinitely interesting , her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents . nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy , only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense . fortunately , i have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer . best quote : bob redding : how 's your head ? elvira : i have n't had any complaints .
when i heard this film was directed by ang lee , i made sure to see it . this taiwanese director burst into fame with `` the wedding banquet '' and `` eat drink man woman '' a few years ago and then moved on to `` sense and sensibility '' and `` the ice storm '' . now , he turns his attention to another american icon -- the civil war . this story takes place in missouri , a union state with southern sympathies . these never officially joined the confederate army . instead , they formed outlaw bands , called `` bushwhackers '' , grew they hair long , and sometimes would confiscated union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing . the movie depicts their moral dilemma , the high drama of the times , and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the union . there are no stars in this movie , unless you consider `` jewel '' the singer , well cast as a young confederate widow as a star . tobey macquire is cast as a young german farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the germans were supposed union sympathizers . this young man is an excellent actor , full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as he 's exposed to the horror of war . jeffrey wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom . he gives a fine and understated performance . some of the acting , however , is wooden , especially in the long conversations they have about morality . and their costumes are too new . and the `` southern gentleman '' theme of manners and hat-tipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much -- especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women 's arms , then burn down the stores and houses . while i do n't think that this will go down as one of lee ang 's `` great '' movies , i did find myself fascinated by it , in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes . i was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of history . not as much action as the usual war movie , but yet still recommended -- especially for civil war buffs .
steve carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 year old virgin , having only had supporting roles in such films as bewitched , bruce almighty , anchorman , and his work on the daily show , we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that carell truly makes his own . you can tell that will ferrell influenced his `` comedic air '' but carell takes it to another level , everything he does is innocent , lovable , and hilarious . i would not hesitate to say that steve carell is one of the next great comedians of our time . the 40 year old virgin is two hours of non-stop laughs ( or 4 hours if you see it twice like i did ) , a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie . the script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all . the music fit the tone of the movie great , and you can tell the director knew what he was doing . filled with sex jokes , some nudity , and a lot of language , this movie is n't for everyone but if you liked the wedding crashers , anchorman , or any movie along those lines , you will absolutely love the 40 year old virgin .
this anime was underrated and still is . hardly the dorky kids movie as noted , i still come back to this 10 years after i first saw it . one of the better movies released . the animation while not perfect is good , camera tricks give it a 3d feel and the story is still as good today even after i grew up and saw ground-breakers like neon genesis evangelion and rahxephon . it has nowhere near the depth obviously but try to see it from a lighthearted view . it 's a story to entertain , not to question . still one of my favourites i come back too when i feel like a giggle on over more lighthearted animes . not to say its a childish movies , there are surprisingly sad moments in this and you need a sense of humour to see it all .
okay , there are a ton of reviews here , what can i possibly add ? i will try anyway . the reason this is my favorite scrooge is because of everything . the sets , outdoor locations , costumes are so beautiful and authentic . the music is sweet . the supporting cast is very well done . one of my favorites is the narrator & nephew , played by roger rees . his understated sincerity is touching and his voice is the sound of christmas to me . david warner is also a totally believable bob cratchit . his is a difficult life , but he remains positive and dignified . the best part of course- is george c. scott as ebenezer scrooge . some have said his portrayal too gruff . i could n't disagree more . his exchanges at the beginning while cold or harsh , were n't out of character . he is a terribly disillusioned man who 's heart has been hardened by the vicissitudes of life and his own lust for wealth . during the flashbacks , it 's obvious that he is n't all gruff . this is where we see that there is hope for him . if he was totally gone , his partner marley would never have come for his sake in the first place . and after all , we are none of us past hoping . i think that is a huge part of what dickens was trying to say . when scrooge looks in on his dance at his employer 's with belle , you see him smile regretfully as he tells belle in the flashback that he will go through life `` with a grin on my face . '' clive donner was smart enough as the director to allow these moments on film . sometimes they get left on the editing room floor . and finally , his conversion is so absolutely full of joy that it makes me cry tears of joy every time i see it . his apology to his nephew fred , so sincere , so moving , it is the spirit not only of christmas , but of humanity itself . the joy he brings to fred , to his wife are so apparent . and the line that gets me every time , `` god forgive me for the time i 've wasted . '' bravi tutti !
great acting on the part of gretchen mol . this film is one of the best biopics to hit the screen in some time . while it does cover the majority of bettie 's young life , it also manages to stay on a mostly focused path which is something most biographical films seem to lack . there is some lovely and alarmingly funny subtext in the dialogue and acting . this film is an excellent break from the dir . of `` american psycho , '' and i think this will show through as her best work to date . oh , and as a cinematography buff , i give this film 100 % in the cine dept . it was amazing how well they pulled off a 50s look with modern film stocks . accolades to the d.o.p . all around very enjoyable . i recommend any interested to see it : 8/10 .
criticism of the film evening , based on the novel by susan minot and adapted for the screen by minot and michael cunningham , has been harsh , so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try . the primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman 's fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth , that famous actors were given very minor roles , that the entire production was over-hyped , etc . for this viewer , seeing the film on a dvd in the quiet of the home , a very different reaction occurred . ann grant lord ( vanessa redgrave ) is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man 's name - 'harris ' - with her two grown daughters nina ( toni colette ) and constance ( natasha richardson ) . as her daughters sit at her bedside ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend lila ( mamie gummer ) - a marriage both ann ( claire danes as the youthful ann ) and lila 's alcoholic brother buddy ( hugh dancy ) objected to , feeling that lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved - harris arden ( patrick wilson ) , her housekeeper 's son who had become a physician . harris , buddy , lila , and ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now , 50 years later , as ann is dying . the older lila ( meryl streep ) visits ann at the end and the secrets are revealed : 'there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on . ' the film is a delicate mood piece and the script by minot and cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons . yes , there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation , but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady 's words , such 'holes ' are understandable . the film is graced by the presence of not only redgrave , richardson ( redgrave 's true daughter ) , collette , gummer ( streep 's true daughter ) , meryl streep , claire danes , eileen atkins , glenn close , hugh dancy and patrick wilson , but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances . the setting is gorgeous ( cinematography by gyula pados ) and the musical score is by the inimitable jan a.p . kaczmarek . lajos koltai ( `` being julia ' ) directs . judge this film on your own .... grady harp
what a delightful romp  a very competently made film that has so much charm and a feelgood factor that a lot of romantic comedies lack . einstein is brilliantly acted by walter matthau , while meg ryan 's catherine is unforgettable  better than i have seen her in those films opposite tom hanks  as the young mathematician struggling to be recognized . you do n't need to be a young woman to understand catherine 's struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately , and as a young man it 's easy to understand what must have gone through ed 's ( tim robbins ) mind in pursuing his true love . there 's universal appeal in these emotions , even if i.q . keeps it all light , fun and tied up nicely . sure it 's not heavy , but if you look there are some subtexts . people remember albert einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritualist ; his sayings such as something along the lines of , 'if it is not impossible , then why do it ? ' suggest he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond one 's immediate grasp . in this film , there are questions of what an accident really is  such as whether albert and his whacky sidekicks ' intervention in prying catherine away from stiff-upper-lip , loveless james ( stephen fry  who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you can not help but feel for his lack of feeling ) counts . how much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see , and comes across as serendipitous ? and of course , we 'd like to think in real life , despite what we often observe of the people we know , that we edwards get the catherines and jameses have to learn how to defrost the icewater in their veins . how nice to know that it might work out in i.q . 's innocent ( and disturbingly , exclusively caucasian ) eisenhower-era land of make-believe .
this is the movie i 've seen more times than any other ( i believe i saw it on average once every year since it was released ) . and every time i see it , it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me . the cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex yu cinematography . this movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover . in the same league : maratonci trce pocasni krug , balkanski spijun and otac na sluzbenom putu . this is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection .
i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store . it was in almost mint condition , and i 'd never heard of it before . clearly nobody else had either . i ca n't believe my luck . you go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message - the very moral and non-triumphalist stance of the mandela party , undoubtedly . despite its enormous length ( i had to watch it in two sittings ) - it was like a book one could n't put down . perhaps the songs are not all that memorable , but the spirit of the thing glows on forever . i can not understand comments that a musical ( clearly designed for stage ) is not realistic ! i 've seen `` south pacific '' and read the book too , and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book . i 'll treasure this little find until it wears out . one day they 'll make this again on a better budget .
i 've been watching `` dick tracy '' for years , and as a result it 's become a vital part of my life - it was with me throughout childhood and i used to see it quite often . seeing it now , as an adult , it 's still a very good movie - dark , satiric and incredibly misunderstood . about the only thing that can be said is the oscar nomination pacino received - other than that it is rarely discussed and did n't make much of a fuss when it came out . pacino is over-the-top but to good effect as he 's clearly having loads of fun . beatty is great as dick tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film , possibly , i have ever seen . just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking . the lighting , velvet overtones and smog/smoke combine to create a great effect . there are some really funny cameos including one by dustin hoffman as `` mumbles , '' and i do n't think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting - even the mandatory kid-character is far better than expected . overall , a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5.7/10 average on imdb . the critics ' reviews are very positive ( check out rottentomatoes.com ) and after seeing the film once again it 's not hard to see why - this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book , from style to eccentricity . highly recommended . 4.5/5 stars .
it 's not well shot , well written or well acted but it has to be the most addictive show i 've seen since twin peaks . every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure . they have even slowed down the pace of the show where they only reveal tiny amounts of information per episode however it feels like they 've just told you everything you wanted to know . however some of the acting is just about awful and some of the duologue is downright brutal . some characters are very two dimensional . the more experienced actors like locke and ecko really stand out over actors who play jack , kate , sayid and so on . the development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode lead up to . annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing . however , the second season has developed to a point where back stories reveal more about the island than they had previously . all in all its a great show but not perfect .
i thought this movie was stunning , with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi ( artemisia gentileschi ) . cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully , with tentative yet confidant mannerisms , her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place . the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch . although not each character was overtly beautiful , this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time . overall i thought this film was fantastic .
have to be honest and say that i have n't seen many independent films , but i thought this one was very well done . the direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction . the angles , settings , and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped . many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after it 's over ( always a sign of a good director ) .
for those of you who love lord of the rings and love special effects , watch this movie ! this will be sure to keep you glued to the screen . you will probably even like it if you like watching people fight with magical stuff .
thank god this was n't based on a true story , because what a story it is . populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds , before the devil is a mesmerizing , jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable ( and sometimes is , even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout ) if it were n't carried out with such magnificent , overwhelming conviction by its stars . the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet does n't hurt either . the main dysfunction here is of a family nature , with the two majorly screwed up brothers ( brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke ) deciding to rob their own parents ' jewelry store , an attempt that goes pathetically awry . the story is told with time-shifts ( which are noted on screen , such as : `` charlie : two days before the robbery '' , so no one should be confused ) ; some people have said they did n't like this device but i thought it worked perfectly , adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair , considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you could n't make a decent poker hand to save your life . throw in these cheesy extra tidbits : one of the brothers is a drug addict , married to gina ( marisa tomei , also excellent ) , who is having an affair with the other brother , toss in some monumental sibling rivalry , along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father ( a wrenching performance from albert finney ) , who has apparently caused him serious past pain , and you 've got a shakespearean/greek tragedy on your hands . proceed with caution .
i grew up watching scooby and have been a fan forever . this cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can get boring to viewers . the crooks in mask routine gets old and this cartoon is a change from that . it 's not meant to replace the scooby gang it 's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers i 'm sure . the cartoon 's focus is on scooby and shaggy who inherits a large sum of money and use that money to thwart world conquest plans from a mad scientist and his goons . small homages of the gang and the gang themselves are featured from time to time . if you are a fan of scooby-doo you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his talking dog , along with the jokes that come with it . just enjoythe cartoon and support the creators/writers and producers so that this wo n't be the last scooby cartoon .
when the matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity , it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration . that did n't really happen , surprisingly , and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear . but to say cypher is a clone would be to its discredit . the story is of a morgan sullivan , who applies for a job with a high-flying techno-company called digicorp . his job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company , while under an assumed and false identity . his home-life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he 's actually doing . however , things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what 's going on , he starts to question who he actually is . this is not helped by a strange woman who turns up ... twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated , and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable . it 's an enthralling journey through a not-too-distant future , and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat . highly recommended .
this three stooges flick is at a tie with my other favorite flick `` disorder in the court '' . this is an uproar of laughter for any three stooges fan to enjoy . the boys are janitors at a recording studio when they hear the lovely christine mcintyre sings a great version of `` voices of spring '' . she is going to be offered a record deal , but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her choice of a career and prove herself as a real singer . when she and the others leave the studio , the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress curly up as christine . the contract lady who can make christine 's career , sees curly and mistakes him for christine and invites curly to sing for her party . of course there is a man that they have upset that is at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd , so he 'll find a way to get back at them . what a great stooge flick , this should not be missed ! 10/10
this is one of the best films i have seen in years ! i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan , but she is excellent as emma woodhouse . alan cumming is superb as reverand elton , and emma thompson 's sister , sophie , is hysterical as miss bates . and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr. knightley ; what a gentleman ! whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma . i think that is what separates it from so many others -- it 's classy . if you 're looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family , or looking for a romance for yourself , look no further . emma is that movie . with a beautiful setting , wonderful costumes , and an outstanding cast ( have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam ? ) , emma is a perfect ten !
ah , the 1970 's . a time when it was in to be a swinger . to be honest , today is also a good time to be a swinger but it just felt more daring then . joe sarno offers up a pretty good soft-core film . in fact , just like today , some of the actors are famous hardcore actors . unlike today , these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development . it 's pretty much what you would expect out of a swinger 's movie . two couples with open relationships re-ignite the wanderlust out of the milf of one of the women who has come for a visit . not much more to it . of course , when the milf is jennifer welles then it is a different story . not too many 40-somethings look as delicious undressed as ms. welles . it 's worth the price alone to see ms. welles look at herself in the mirror as if she 's aphrodite . she 's no `` stifler 's mom '' . she 's way sexier . i also digged chris jordan 's anna . jordan looks and sounds so much like elaine joyce that i thought she might be her `` separated at birth '' twin or even elaine herself . anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism . unlike 1990 's soft-core porn , 70 's softie porn retained the hardcore film 's realism ( something that 2000 's soft-core has brought back on occasion , instead of the 90 's music and canned orgasms ) and it is here in full force . it 's not real but it feels real . for those who enjoyed the quebec produced `` deux femmes en or '' , you 'll enjoy this one . another classic film only on drive-in classics , the best $ 2.50 can a month you can spend .
( question ) what do you call 100 film critics buried up to their necks in sand ? ( answer ) a good start . well , i do n't know peter mattei from adam but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests , `` love in the time of money '' is a `` good start '' . a classy shoot with whimsical music box style music , this flick looks at a chain of tenuous relationships as it moves from person a to person b to person c ... etc ... and back again ending with persons a & b in carousel fashion . the film gently probes the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered shadings beginning and ending with a street whore and her client . the downside of this film is the lack of a story which may have something to do with the many critical slams it received . i watched the behemoth `` angels in america '' last night and was bored at the end while this little concatenation of character studies kept me spell bound . use caution . i may be the only person who really liked this flick .

opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama . all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener ( and the performer ) intrigued and entertained applies to this film . there is n't a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad . mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor . if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended ? as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited .
this tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being . the irreverent pupils , the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils . the adult characters all seem familiar , my teachers , my bus driver , each one of their opinions so plausible and well known . when a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints . all the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip . mr harvey is experiencing much pain throughout . he reminds me of war damaged teachers i did not understand when i was an irreverent pupil . rhidian brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped british film . the acting unblemished , the scenes appropriate , it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity .
director vincenzo natali 's cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which , although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration , manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience . morgan sullivan ( jeremy northam ) , a stay-at-home husband with an overbearing wife , decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high-tech company digi corp. his job is to travel to conferences across the country ( under the assumed identity of jack thursby ) and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses , via a nifty little electronic pen-gizmo . in reality , however , the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities . morgan , along with his fellow conference attendees , is being brainwashed . the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma , during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities . once they are totally convinced that they are someone else , they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies , where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion . but digi corp 's plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative-for-hire rita foster ( lucy liu ) , who opens morgan 's eyes to what is really happening . she gives morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques . she also warns him that if digi corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack thursby , then he will be 'eliminated ' . morgan plays along , and applies for a job at rival business sunways . however , arriving at his new workplace , he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy . fortunately , the bosses at sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to digi corp and morgan becomes a double agent . from hereon in , things get progressively more complicated ; the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone . in an exciting finale , all eventually becomes clear ( but only if you 've been following events very carefully ) . director natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget . he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast ; jeremy northam , in particular , is fantastichis portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection . cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and i eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects , high rise and necropolis .
there seems to be only two types of reviews of this film on the net . those who hate it and curse ralph bakshis name and those love it and call it work of genious . i 'm inclined to be in the middle . i'am forced to agree with most of the criticisms of this film ( e.g.the cruel cutting of the story , badly rotoscoped charecters , over acting etc ... ) but dispite this i still love this film . the rotoscoping ( when done properly ) adds an eerie lifelike dimension to the charecters and the final battle scene at the end of the film is fantastic . the surrealistic scenes when the nineriders chase frodo are stylish and well executed and the musical score ... magic . sadly the bad points outweight film but if you can bring yourself to ignore them it is a great film . ( no doubt i 'll be lynched by an angry mob of people who hate this film after writing this review , ah well , such is life )
this movie is goofy as hell ! i think it was written as a serious film , but then when it came time to film , michael cooney said `` hey , let 's throw in some humor and spice it up ! '' the characters are actually slightly developed , too . oh , and the death sequences are the best . one thing i hate , though , was the hairdryer-weapons . what was that all about ?
the shining is a weird example of adaptation : it has very little in common with the source novel , written by stephen king , yet it is widely remembered as one of the best cinematic renditions of the horror master 's work . this is due to two factors : stanley kubrick 's masterful direction and jack nicholson 's chilly acting . nicholson plays jack torrance , a writer who accepts to take care of the overlook hotel in canada during the winter period , unaffected by the gruesome stories surrounding the place : he claims a nice , isolated location is just what he needs to finish his new book . therefore the overlook becomes the new home of the torrance family : jack , his wife wendy ( shelley duvall ) and their five-year old son danny ( danny lloyd ) . the boy in particular senses right from the beginning that something 's wrong : he has been told by the cook , dick o ' hallorann ( scatman crothers ) that he is endowed with a mysterious psychic energy , the titular shining , which allows people like him and dick to see flashes from the past and the future , among other things . because of this `` gift '' , the forces that inhabit the hotel immediately take an interest in danny , even though he is quite capable of resisting them . that is not jack 's case , however , as he gets increasingly paranoid regarding his wife 's affections and seeks comfort in the company of what can best be defined as ghosts , triggering a chain of insanity and dread which is very hard to break . the shining works as a horror movie because kubrick , though having never worked on this kind of film before , knew exactly what was effective and what was n't , hence the larger focus on atmosphere and psychological shocks than gore and creative bloodbaths . king criticized the director for changing most of the story , omitting most of the jack/danny subplot ( merely hinted at in the film ) that led to the book 's emotionally strong climax , and while his disappointment is valid , the omission was actually necessary : the novel dealt with redemption , albeit in an unconventional way , and redemption is a theme kubrick , one of the most famous analysts of human decay , never had a soft spot for . what he is interested in is the mental , and subsequently physical , unbalance that threatens the characters , and he keeps the creepy tone even thanks to a very cold approach and expert use of the steadicam shot ( danny 's encounter with two ghostly twins being the best example ) . another criticism king raised was about the actors , especially nicholson : in the writer 's opinion , his trademark grin at the start of the movie seemed to indicate jack already was insane , thus undermining the rest of the story . now , it is true that nicholson looks a bit goofy from the very beginning , but it is equally true that martin sheen ( king 's ideal choice for the role ) probably would not have been able to deliver a performance as terrifying as nicholson 's : from the moment he starts grinning in a more unsettling way than before to the immortal `` here 's johnny ! '' scene , it is impossible to picture another actor playing that part , and even though the tv version of the shining from 1997 is n't bad the torrance character is indelibly linked to the one flew over the cuckoo 's nest star . as for duvall and lloyd , both add terrific support , the latter especially deserving a place alongside harvey stephens ( the omen 's damien ) and haley joel osment as cinema 's great horror child icons . one might complain about duvall being completely different from the book counterpart ( blonde and beautiful ) and not having much else to do but scream and run , but two things ought to be considered : a ) back in 1980 the `` scream queen '' cliché was n't one yet ; b ) rarely has any actress looked so genuinely terrified on camera , making the book-movie differences secondary compared to the real fear that emerges from wendy 's eyes . irvine welsh , the author of trainspotting , once said there is no such thing as a completely faithful adaptation of any literary work ( and he should know , given the liberties danny boyle took when his junkie masterpiece was brought to the screen ) , yet that does n't mean the movie is necessarily bad . the shining proves said point to perfection : very little from the novel , approximately 5 % , is included in the film , but in kubrick and nichlolson 's hands this masterclass in loose cinematic translation becomes one of the finest , most original horror pictures of all time , which really is saying something given the genre 's current poor form .
any one who has seen mel gibson 's the passion of the christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead . though it was n't a success in th box office or tv ratings , the fox movie channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually . i liked the way that they trained chris sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in hebrew.though sarandon did n't have long hair like any other jesus would in other films , his looks are pretty close to what a jewish man would appear . what surprised me or startled me was the scene where caiaphas told jesus about pilate `` and do n't ever forget , that you are a jew ! '' though that may have not been a racist remark , colin blakely was trying to make chris sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days.keith michell 's portrayal of pilate was hulking , comparing with his previous performances in `` the story of jacob and joseph '' and `` the story of david '' . but if you compare his portrayal of pilate with telly savala 's or hurd hatfield , you can say that he really painted well the impression of a roman procurator .
a prequel to the re-imagined battlestar galactica series , from the same creative team ronald d. moore and david eick as well as new series co-creator remi aubuchon . caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of battlestar galactica . the new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the cylon race . the pilot and the series are set to follow two families ; the graystone 's which include daniel ( eric stoltz ) a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter zoe ( alessandra toreson ) , while the adama 's include joseph ( esai morales ) a lawyer and his son william the future admiral of battlestar galactica . like battlestar galactica the series includes some great experienced actors in eric stoltz , esai morales and polly walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including alessandra toreson and magda apanowicz . for fans of battlestar gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series but it is also very different . in the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series . the scenes on caprica while reflecting a more technologically advanced society also have retro feel , this is achieved through some of the architecture , the costumes and the way it is shot . while the look and feel of the two series have some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar , religion is again very important here , while the racial theme rarely touched on in bg is far more important . we also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have one , as well as issues related to crime and government . the pilot has been released direct to dvd in an extended and unrated version prior to airing on tv , the series is set to start in 2010 . like battlestar galactica this series is filmed in vancouver
featuring a fascinating performance by will smith and a story that tugs at your heartstrings harder than a rock guitarist mid-solo , `` seven pounds '' races past the director 's previous collaboration with the actor ( the pursuit of happiness ) , a flick which i also loved . remember gabriele muccino 's name because some of his movies may skip by unnoticed if the actor attached to the project is n't quite so high-profile . too bad i figured out will smith 's scheme early on , i put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when rosario dawson 's character is introduced as having an incurable heart-disease . however , i still think the writer/director made the right choice putting the bookends ( bookends are the first and the last scene ) in that way , it 's the source of urgency and tension in the movie , finding out gradually how exactly a man can be driven to that ultimate sacrifice , and it was heartbreaking to see the relationship between smith 's and dawson 's character flourish and develop , knowing in the back of the mind always what was in store for these unlucky two . one of my friends with whom i saw the movie thought smith 's character could have a divine gift , and i understand why : his performance is almost angelic when in the presence of his seven elected ones , yet at other times he could be harsh and scary , and when he 's alone the full weight of his situation got too much for him and he breaks down completely . it 's quite a versatile performance . lastly i ca n't forget to mention the crash scene re-enactment , which was really quite stunningly done in terms of cinematography paired with music . put this on your list .
a stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman -- so obsessed that he loses perspective and common sense . an evil magician approaches him and informs him he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the lady 's heart if he agrees to give him anything he wants that 's within their room . the dumb guy agrees and the magician steals the man 's reflection out of the mirror -- and bad things naturally occur as a result . if this film had been made just a decade later , i am sure i would n't have been so charitable in reviewing and scoring this film . after all , the film 's plot is a bit vague in spots and the acting is , at times , a bit stilted . however , when you consider that in 1913 `` full-length '' films were rare -- and often only 20 to 30 minutes long ! plus , the whole idea of a complex story like you get in this film is very unusual -- as stories were very short and broadly acted . so , given the limitations of the time , this film is pretty good and is one of the earlier horror films known .
frustrating to watch because of one man 's stubbornness to leave his native country for the dream land in switzerland and what he does to achieve that creates heartache for all those involved . along the journey he encounters scumbags who take advantage of other human suffering and desperation .
the setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of dickens ' classic tale . george c. scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast . his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie . then his character changes to one who is truly repentant . the 19th century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film . it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and it 's a wonderful life .
i found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one . altman 's touch with zooms in and out were there , and i expected those devices to comment on characters and situations . unfortunately , as far as i could see , they sometimes were gratuitous , sometimes witty , often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection . in particular , two zoom-outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed . to be fair , though , a few zooms ( outs and ins ) to branagh heightened his character 's increasing bewilderment , a la pudgy mccabe 's or philip marlow 's . on the whole , the zooms were , well , inconsistent , and sometimes even trite . other almanesque devices , such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject , succeeded in suggesting characters ' sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge . car windshields , house windows , and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently , i felt , harking back to the player and even the long goodbye . a few catchy jump-cuts , especially to a suggestive tv commercial , reminded me of such usage in short cuts , to sardonic effect . but finally , the mismatch between altman 's very personal style and the sheer weight of the grisham-genre momentum , failed to excite me . this director 's 1970s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres , including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways ; this time around , the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre . was he muzzled in by mammonist producers , perhaps ? or am i missing something , due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on here ? nonetheless , the casting was excellent all around : tom berenger ( for his terrifying ferality ) , branagh for his ( deflated ) hubris , robert downey jr 's pheromonal haze , robert duvall 's method of trash , and davidtz 's lurking femme-fatality were near perfect choices all . and except for a few slips out of georgia into chicago on the part of ( brunette ? ) daryl hannah , accents were convincingly southern . suspense and mood were engrossing , even if the story did n't quite rivet viewers . the moodiness of a coastal pre-hurricane barometric plunge was exquisitely , painstakingly rendered -- i felt like yelling at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler pronto . torn , in the end i judged it a 7 .
first one has to take into account the time period this film was made in . 1995 . rappers were in it , and that added to the flair of it . remy was a socially awkward teen trying to find his way and could n't , until he met and was befriended by nazis . they took him in . nazi 's are n't all this awkward , but like most gangs , they fill a void that is missing be it economic , social , emotional , whatever . michael rappaport played the part perfectly . omar epps was the hot shot track star , with a questionable work ethic and a chip on his shoulder . he kept trying to feel sorry for himself and his plight , and had his girlfriend and professor to straighten him out on it . kristen was a young white girl trying to find herself and trying to fit in , until she was date raped . she then found her self experiment with her sexuality , and getting involved politically . this film deals with racism and like most things that deal with racism , people 's own perspectives come into play . i read so many comments about how there were no 'evil ' black characters but there were evil white one ( nazis ) . so what ? remy was n't portrayed as evil at all , he was trying to find his way , and kept failing until some skinheads accepted him . he was scared , it was sad to see him devolve how he did . he even says right before he kills himself , i did n't mean it , i wanted to be an engineer . ice cube and busta rhymes were angry black men , ice cube was somewhat of an intellectual , and busta rhymes was just portrayed as a dumb thug . they both showed no consideration at all for their roommates , and generally appear to not like white people very much . they were angry like the nazis but not on the level of nazis in terms of overall badness . sorry if this makes it seem unfair , but are there really black groups like the nazis ? no . people say it shows white=-bad black=good . not true , the only bad white characters were the nazis and the police , which is more or less true in real life . kristen was a good girl , her boyfriend ( omar epps roommate ) was a good guy , and even remy was a good guy , he was just misguided . omar epps , ice cube and busta were seriously flawed characters , angry and inconsiderate . although their constant harassment by police seemed to justify some of their anger . remy 's inability to fit in seemed to justify his anger as well . good movie , well done . like all movies that deal with racism , its a great piece to get a discussion going . i do n't think cube and busta coulda beat those nazis though .
when i first saw this movie , i thought it was the typical `` love thy neighbour '' stuff .... the more the movie was going on , the more i got involved . acting is magnificent from both actors , direction was great , the story unusual . cried my eyes off , first time in my life for a movie . a real must have in any serious videoteque . 11 out of 10
sadly not available on dvd as yet , but worth pursuing on tcm or vhs . a secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder , and courageously takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth . a movie with many twists and dark alleyways , none of which i will mention ! the jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer , is one of the most erotic scenes in hollywood history , despite being at very low budget and made during wwii in black and white . despite the low budget - long island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of original style and outstanding vision . ella raines was a great actress discovered by howard hawks who knew much about these matters , casting the feistiest women - joanne dru , hepburn , angie dickinson , lauren bacall , ann sheridan - of their era . robert siodmak was of one of several german , hungarian & czech film-makers - sirk , wilder , zinnemann , lubitsch , curtiz , lang , etc - who émigrés relocated to hollywood , and brought a highly original fresh vision with them . sadly ella raines was never given such a great part again , and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns .
i admit that i am a vampire addict : i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten . i was very impressed by the original john carpenter 's vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it . this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first , and it is not quite so dark , but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original . jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss : his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives . one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she seems . his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds . the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film . it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night . there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme . if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one . if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else .
super speedway makes a great demo of your new dvd / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system . the imax camera puts you right in the race car , where you cruise around various tracks at high speed , reminiscent of the driving sequences in grand prix ( if only that would appear on dvd ! ) . i enjoy watching it again and again . the only minus , and why i did n't give it a 10 , is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up . the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine . you wo n't hear swooshes as you go under bridges .
unlike many other films , which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness ( man bites dog ) or their sheer violence ( most peckinpah films ) , deliverance shocks by its plausibility . certainly , the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness , but the film 's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads , both before and after everything starts to go wrong . the moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge , who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with , let alone show any sign of human affection towards them , is among the most sinister in modern film . the tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip , and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters ' ordeals horrifically real . the movie 's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads , particularly ned beatty and jon voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively . burt reynolds , too , has never been better . the film 's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory ' - perhaps only get carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region 's tourist industry . i can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of se7en is the best comparison i can think of . although so much of it is excellent of itself , deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique .
* * possible spoilers * * i like this film and have no problem staying awake for it . it reminds me of me at 20 , except this is even better . like veronica says , two chicks at one time . it brings out the horniness in me , the casual conversation , these two real life chicks , rather than hookers , teasing us every step of the way . i get into the conversations too . even if they are utterly b.s . at times , so what ? every chick , just about , that i 've ever talked to and is high on herself is usually full of the same unreasoned rambling gratuitous self-centered b.s . philosophy . it 's just a bunch of nonsense , and about as sensible as that other b.s . philosophy chicks are often into : astrological charts . the only deal with this movie is the guy is almost as feminine as the women , he 's into the same b.s . and moodiness . the brunette chick is actually the most masculine person there . i think it 's kind of funny that the brunette chick gets so obviously turned on by veronica . she 'd love to pull the little blonde away from alexander , but veronica plays her all the way . she 's brilliant . she gets the brunette thinking there 's something up between them , and then she steals the boy-child/man , which is only appropriate since they appear to be from the same age group . the brunette knows she 's been had by the end , when she 's dropping her face into the palms of her hands while marlene deitrich sings in the background that , paraphrasing , there are a million couples in paris tonight , but i only have this refrain . but do they get married in the end , alex and veronica ? mmmm ? i can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-marriage breakup . they are too selfish to be anything to each other than stepping stones . i like the film though . it kept me entertained , it 's got a nice look , and it 's sexy .
being someone who lists night of the living dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time , and at the same time loving this student film parody , i feel i must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing reviews . this short but sweet opus has always been a crowd-pleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously . this film is a tribute to the original , not an insult . it is intended to be funny , and many others who i have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds . especially for those of us who have seen notld 50+ times . watch for the director cameo as news reporter jeff drexel , and also if you have the opportunity catch his alien parody , loaf .
in the hollywood west those trail hands were a rough bunch who when they came to town , partied pretty hardy . after all trail driving was a lonely business back in the day before railroads got to all parts of the usa . the drovers who worked for trail boss gil favor as played by eric fleming were no different . but fleming was a man of all business , he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do it . with the long run of rawhide and the fact that the regulars stayed with it for the most part , we got to know all the drovers at some point . a some point story lines were focused around all of them , though the bulk were with fleming and clint eastwood 's character rowdy yates , the number 2 guy with the herd . clint eastwood 's western image was molded by rawhide , it 's a shame that these are not shown more often . probably because they were done in black and white . had this been an nbc show , this would have been done in color like bonanza and be running as often as those shows are . we 'd get to see a lot more of a man who became a move legend . ironically enough it was eric fleming who left the show before it closed to do films . he did a few them and was hoping the show would give him a bankable movie name . sadly he was killed on a movie location doing an action film , drowned in a river . had he lived he might have become a name like eastwood 's . clint took over as trail boss in the last season and then the show completed its run . and he of course became the icon he is today and not just in the western genre . rawhide was a tough western who had some tough guys in it . no frills in this one , these were working cowboys just doing a job and battling the elements and whatever situations they were thrown into every year . they really do n't make television series like these any more . what a pity .
maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly , despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility . she will do everything to make her marriage work , including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation . and thus beneath the vicey exterior , she reveals a rather sweet value system . the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate , with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with 'and then i woke up ' . it is also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence i 've ever seen , but do n't let any of that put you off .
in this send-up of horror films , 50 's cold war paranoia , reagan-era america , and high school films , adam arkin plays tony , the star quarterback of full moon high in the 1950 's . he and his father ( ed mcmahon ) travel to communist romania and while he 's lost in the streets one night , he is bitten by a werewolf . when he returns stateside , he can not control his animalistic urges and goes on a killing spree . frustrated , he flees town . decades later , the immortal tony returns to town and re-enrolls in highschool . he still ca n't control his transformations , and the townspeople , and his friends , realize he 's not quite human . it all culminates during the schools big football game . i expected this to be one of those 'so bad it 's good ' films from the early 80 's . but i was surprised that the film was actually , legitimately funny . the cast , including kenneth mars as a pervy coach , roz kelly as tony 's lusty former flame , demond wilson as a bus driver , and alan arkin as a oddball doctor , go all out , with hilarious results . while watching this film i was struck by how similar the writing and humor were to 'family guy . ' 'full moon high ' has that same anything goes attitude and never takes itself seriously .
i first saw rob roy twelve years ago . with little money for entertainment , i rented it for my fiancé and i to watch on a bone chilling winter 's night . the movie i had wanted was gone , so i rented this instead , not expecting much , and was very much surprised with how good it was . i just recently watched it again , and loved it every bit as much as the first time . for those unfamiliar with the story , it 's about scottish outlaw robert roy macgregor , a cattleman and folk hero . from the little i know about the man and his story , liberties have been taken with the facts , but it 's a movie , not a textbook , and so the filmmakers can be excused . basically , the plot of the movie is that rob roy borrows money from the marquis of montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from . but , his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest . our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the marquis , and mary , his wife , suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of archibald cunningham , a smarmy englishman with no soul . atrocities ensue , until , in an immensely satisfying conclusion , rob carves archibald up like a christmas turkey . there are many great performances in this movie , but allow me to touch specifically on a few . liam neeson , as usual , is fantastic , a sexy beast you ca n't take your eyes off of . honestly , this man is like ice cream : even when he 's bad he 's good . his rob roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him , in the best way he knows how . jessica lange , as mary , gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering , dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure . you just know she does n't take any b.s from rob , or anyone else for that matter . tim roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil archibald , yet somehow , it works . all the posturing and preening , combined with some wicked dialogue , result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory . combine all of this , and the stellar work by other supporting players , with the luscious scenery of scotland , and you have what amounts to one really , really cool movie . if you have n't seen this , i highly recommend that you do .
( spoilers included ) this film surely is the best amicus production i 've seen so far ( even though i still have quite a few to check out ) . the house that dripped blood is a horror-omnibus an anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the tenants of a vicious , hellish house in the british countryside . a common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the wraparound story that connects the separate tales peter duffel 's film wisely does n't pay too much attention to that . it simply handles about a scotland yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that , he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before . all four stories in this film are of high quality-level and together , they make a perfect wholesome . high expectations are allowed for this film , since it was entirely written by robert bloch ! yes , the same bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone ` psycho' we 're also marking peter duffel 's solid and very professional debut as a director . the four stories  chapters if you will  in the house that dripped blood contain a good diversity in topics , but they 're ( almost ) equally chilling and eerie . number one handles about a horror-author who comes to the house , along with his wife , in order to find inspiration for his new book . this starts out real well , but after a short while , his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination . the idea in this tale is n't exactly original but it 's very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising . the second story stars ( hammer ) horror-legend peter cushing as a retired stockbroker . still haunted by the image of an unreachable and long-lost love , he bumps into a wax statue that looks exactly like her . cushing is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of wax museums is n't new  this story looks overall fresh and innovating . this chapter also contains a couple of delightful shock-moments and there 's a constant tense atmosphere . it 's a terrific warm-up for what is arguably the best story : number 3 . another legendary actor in this one , as christopher lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father . he 's very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world . not without reason , since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo . besides great acting by lee and the remarkable performance of chloe franks as the spooky kid , this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere ! the devilish undertones in this story , along with the creepy sound effects of thunder , make this story a must for fans of authentic horror . the fourth and final story , in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire-cloak he wears , is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility , but that the overload of subtle humor more or less compensates that . there 's even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co-star christopher lee in the dracula series ! most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous ingrid pitt ! the cult-queen from ` the vampire lovers ' certainly is one of the many highlights in the film her cleavage in particular . no doubt about it the house that dripped blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans . i truly believe that , with a bit of mood-settling preparations , this could actually be one of the few movies that 'll terrify you and leave a big impression . intelligent and compelling horror like it should be ! highly recommended . one extra little remark , though : this film may not repeat may not under any circumstances be confused with ` the dorm that dripped blood ' . this latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80 's slasher that has got nothing in common with this film , except for the title it stole .
excellent movie , albeit slightly predictable . i have to comment on nicole kidmans acting in this movie . some of her other works have n't shown the amazing talent this woman has , but birthday girl does n't suffer from this in the slightest . even without words kidmans acting shines through .
paris , je t'aime is a wondrous cinematic homage to the city of light and the city of love , a film so complex that it almost defies summarization and reviewing . ask a large group of people their impressions of life in paris and the result would be something akin to this film . tied together by each of the sectors or arrondissement of the city , the film examines love in all forms , native folk in their parisian modes , and tourists interacting with the great city . approximately twenty writers and directors , each with about five minutes of screen time , include olivier assayas , the coen brothers , sylvain chomet , isabel coixet , wes craven , alfonso cuarón , gérard depardieu , christopher doyle , vincenzo natali , alexander payne , walter salles , nobuhiro suwa , and gus van sant among others less well known . the stories vary from hilarious , to humorous , to touching , to tragic , to banal , to tender . in one story a young frenchman ( gaspard ulliel ) is attracted to a young lithographer ( elias mcconnell ) , pouring out his heart in french to a lad who speaks only english . in another a separated husband and wife ( gena rowlands and ben gazzara ) meet in the latin quarter to finalize divorce proceedings while another couple in père-lachaise ( emily mortimer and rufus sewell ) approach marriage without connection until the spirit of departed oscar wilde intervenes . steve buscemi in tuileries confronts superstition in a subway with his bag of tourist collections , in bastille sergio castellitto ( in love with mistress leonor watling ) is ready to divorce his wife miranda richardson until she confides she has terminal leukemia , juliette binouche confronts agony about her son 's fantasies and loss in place des victoires with the help of a mythical cowboy willem defoe , sara martins and nick nolte and ludivine sagnier display a keen tale of mistaken ideas in parc monceau , fanny ardant and bob hoskins 'play out ' a strange relationship in pigalle , melchior beslon plays a young blind man to actress natalie portman in learning how to see in faubourg saint-denis , vampire love between elijah wood and olga kurylenko in quartier de la madeleine , maggie gyllenhaal is an ex-patriot actress stung out on drugs in quartier des enfants rouges , and margo martindale is a visiting tourist letter carrier trying desperately to speak the french she has studied for her life 's trip in a tenderly hilarious 14ème arrondissement . the final few minutes of the film tries to tie together as many of the stories as feasible , but this only works on superficial levels . the film is long and there are no bridges between the many stories , a factor that can tire the audience due to lack of time to assimilate all of the action . but it is in the end a richly detailed homage to a great city and supplies the viewer with many vignettes to re-visit like a scrapbook of a time in paris . it is a film worth seeing multiple times ! grady harp
nothing is fantastic ! simple as that ! it 's a film that should n't work , yet does . natali stays in the realm of sci-fi , however this film is also a comedy . cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for natali ( at $ 7.5million ! woo-hoo pa ! ) so with nothing he scales down again . this is low budget , independent film-making at it 's best . simple , good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to hollywood 's usual reasons for mostly financial gain . nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask , no it is not anything like seinfeld ! basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers . they live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways . andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out . dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with . by bizarre mis-fortunes however , dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from daves work-place incriminating dave , and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout ( canadian humour people ! ) . as it turns out andrew 's house is to be demolished as well and he ca n't stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on . both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling . they are desperate and ca n't escape , and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white . what has happened ? have dave and andrew died ? they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet . no police , no demolition team , no angry girl scout mother ! what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to `` wish or hate away . '' as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world . they are left alone . the house is surrounded by nothing , which is portrayed as pure white . so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white . the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water , they begin to tire of each other . they discover they can hate away hunger , which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say . i ca n't reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold . this film is quirky , funny , interesting . the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube , david hewlett , and andrew millar to lead the film . they have chemistry and also work very well . they have to hold 90 % of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background , yet it works . certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states . nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and comers . natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i can not wait for his next feature . i prey to god he does n't do the proposed necropolis , written and directed by add sufferer , the ever crap paul anderson . vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad , run ! ! ! run like the wind ! ! i hope and prey this guy does n't take to hollywood like alex proyas did ( with the enjoyable yet pussy-footed , sugar coated , helium light : i robot ! ) . keep your eyes peeled for this guy . * * * *
bela made 9 pics for monogram , but it was only at this one , the 4th , that things started to come together . all the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production , writing and character development . from here on , better or worse , the series would also deal with one essential theme : a scientist ( usually bela ) makes experiments in the basement or the old house ( sometimes in the basement in the old house ) that causes things to go blooey . this was also the first time that art director dave milton got a chance to spread his wings . he came on board for black dragons , the flick before , but this one is where he gets to make his craft start to click . lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing , and was around for all the rest of the monograms . casting is key in these , and it 's a pretty good one b movie wise , here . you get barclay and harlen ( also from black dragons ) , along with russell , who would star in lewtons ' cat people movies .. and rosetto , from spooks run wild ... a nice slice of poverty row talent . if you have limited time and budget , start with this one ... it sums up everything they had learned up to this point , and gives you something to compare the rest to . the plot ? bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young . they both like to sleep in coffins . if you can read that and smile , the rest will be easy .
i would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 vote if claudia black had not continued on in it ! her inclusion as the silly 'vela ' has brought the series down in my estimation . to bring her in as a regular at the same time as including ben browder to replace rda was a mistake . unfortunately we were just reeling from the loss of 'jack ' and really did n't need this great series turned into new episodes of 'farscape ' . i was a great fan of the film `` stargate '' and when the series was first announced i had reservations that it could live up to the film , but after watching the first episode i have to admit i was hooked . i have always looked forward to new episodes with great anticipation
grand canyon is a very strange bird . it 's a completely unique urban piece , where relating the entire plot would fail to convey much . it 's central theme seems to be the inherent uncertainty life holds for people of every race , background and station . but to proclaim that the theme of the film would be to horribly understate its scope . similarly , to pigeonhole it in a particular genre is futile . the film has volumes to say , though likely different volumes for every viewer , and says it all in such a non-preachy way from so many angles , that in the end , i ca n't even define its central message for myself . nevertheless , it does it 's business with such laser precision ; every prop , line of dialog , and bar of background music contributing to it 's pervasive mood and powerful message , that i 'm pleasantly surprised , and come away very thoughtful after every viewing . still it does n't feel at all stuffy . a sparkling film with a great cast and everything working .
since i watched it for the first time , `` piedras '' is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures i actually could watch over and over again . the great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women ( all of them somehow interconnected ) with deep understanding and sensibility . ramón salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut , and proves himself as an efficient actors ' director . not that all performances are excellent , though . of all leading ladies , they range from average ( najwa nimri ) to very good ( vicky peña ) , but the standing ovation should be directed to newcomer mónica cervera , who convincingly plays antonia san juan 's retarded daughter . enrique alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl 's male nurse , and there are nice small turns from andrés gertrúdix , geli albaladejo and the director himself , ramón salazar . `` piedras '' is beautifully written and filmed , when i watched it i got so moved that i could n't stop thinking of it for days . i highly recommend it .
one of the best comedians ever . i 've seen this show about 10 times and will probably watch it at least 100 more . my friends and family quote from this dvd so often , you 'd think we did nothing other than watch it . the beginning part about alcatraz is a little bit slow , but either wade through it or zip on through to the part where eddie is on stage . watch for the `` cake or death '' part ( joking about the church of england ) and the `` hitler/pol pot '' part ( hard to explain , just watch it ) . the best part of the show may be eddie 's facial expressions . he can really say a lot with his eyes . ( mascara , eyeliner , and eyeshadow probably help , huh ? ) fair warning : eddie does have a tendency to throw a lot of four-letter words in .
you could stage a version of charles dickens ' `` a christmas carol '' with sock puppets and i 'll probably watch it . ever since i was a child , this has been one of my favorite stories . maybe it 's the idea that there is good in everyone , and that therefore no one is beyond redemption , that appeals to me , but for whatever reason i never miss an opportunity to watch one of the many screen adaptations of this timeless classic when they 're on tv as they inevitably are this time of year . what makes this version really stand out is the somber gravitas that the cast bring to their respective roles . lines we 've heard dozens of times in the past take on a whole new intensity , and each character becomes more real and believable in the hands of this wonderful ensemble . george c. scott was nominated for an emmy in 1985 for this role . it is to his everlasting credit that rather than sleepwalking through this oft-portrayed role of scrooge , he instead gave it a fresh interpretation that was , in my opinion , one of his finest performances ever . he wisely did not attempt a british accent , instead delivering his lines in that famous gravelly voice . his scrooge is not merely a cranky old man ( as he is so often portrayed ) , but a man who harbors a profound anger against the world . as he is visited in turn by each of the three spirits , we understand how this anger took root , grew , and ultimately strangled his soul . as he is forced to review his life , we see him alternately softening , and then relapsing again into unrepentant obstinacy . and in the great dramatic scene when he , kneeling and weeping at his own grave , begs for mercy as he attempts to convince the third spirit of his repentance and desire to alter his life , we see a man who has been utterly broken and brought to his knees literally and figuratively . scott has made scrooge utterly believable and painfully human . impressive as scott 's performance is , the ensemble of supporting actors contributes significantly the this version 's dark beauty . fred holywell , scrooge 's nephew , is an excellent example of this . often portrayed as an affable buffoon , here he is played by roger rees with an emotional intensity missing from earlier portrayals . when he implores scrooge , `` i ask nothing of you . i want nothing from you . why ca n't we be friends ? `` , we see in his face not only his frustration , but his pain at scrooge 's self-imposed separation from his only living relative . it is a moving performance , and one of the movie 's most dramatic scenes . even more magnificent is the performance given by the wonderful english actor frank finlay as scrooge 's late partner , jacob marley . in most versions of this tale , the scene with marley tends to be a bit of a low point in the film , simply because it 's difficult to portray a dead man convincingly , and the results are usually just plain silly ( ooooh , look , it 's a scary ghost ....... not ! ) in this version , it is perhaps the most riveting scene in the whole movie . marley 's entrance , as the locks on scrooge 's door fly open of their own accord and the sound of chains rattling echo throughout the house , is wonderfully creepy . but finlay 's marley is no ethereal spirit . he is a tortured soul , inspiring both horror and pity . marley may be a ghost , but his rage and regret over a life wasted on the pursuit of wealth , and his despair at his realization that his sins are now beyond redress , are still very human . as portrayed by finlay , we have no problem believing that even the flinty scrooge would be shaken by this nightmarish apparition . finlay really steals the scene here , something not easy to do when you 're opposite george c. scott . and it just goes on and on , one remarkable performance after another , making it seem like you 're experiencing this story for the first time . edward woodward ( remember him from the equalizer ? ) is by turns both jovial and menacing as the ghost of christmas present . when he delivers the famous line , `` it may well be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man 's child '' he is no longer a jolly santa claus surrogate , but an avenging angel who gives scrooge a much needed verbal spanking . susannah york is a wonderfully tart tongued mrs. cratchit , and david warner brings marvelous depth to the long suffering bob cratchit , a man who goes through life bearing the triple crosses of poverty , a sick child , and an insufferable boss . his face alternately shows his cheerful courage , and also , at times , his weariness , in the face of intolerable circumstances . later , in the scene in which scrooge is shown by the ghost of christmas yet to come the cratchit family after the death of tiny tim , warner 's performance , while hardly uttering a word , will move you to tears .
sisters in law is made by the same directors of the rather curiously fascinating 'divorce , iranian style ' which was as exactly as it stated , as we got a glimpse of divorce court in iran . now they 've turned their attention to the court system in cameroon , africa . what 's great about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are women , which is unusual for such a country like this . anyways , they deal with plenty of men used to getting their way around the women , but this film is remarkable in the fact that it appears that women has made great strides in society , with divorce legal and women 's rights being recognized . so the judges often chastise the men for behaving in a primitive way in these times . not to say that the women who appear at the court get the softer treatment . one of the prime focuses of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt . the judges waste no time in lashing out at the woman with fury . and who said that justice is n't served anymore ? with these 2 behind the bench . they often carry out maximum penalties ! ya ! you go girl !
i was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this - many parts of grey gardens are very funny and unbelievably surreal - documentary of not , this really gives fellini or david lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes . i kept focusing on how these women ( who are clinically way beyond eccentric ) reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways , and i wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue-blood universe , perhaps some abuse , or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its ' own . this might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation , without going completely over the edge - as the edies do their thing , i kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble-strewn bedroom , cats urinating on the bed , racoons emerging from holes in the walls , and the final scene seemed incredibly sad - like a child 's birthday party gone seriously wrong . very definitely worth seeing and seeking out - you 'll never forget it , but very disturbing .
one of the most timely and engrossing documentaries , you 'll ever watch . while the story takes place in the venezuelan capital of caracas , it provides an intimate look into political dynamics , that prevail throughout the western hemisphere . while essentially another chapter in the story of the `` u.s. backed , latin american coup '' , this film chronicles in real-time , what can happen when the poorest people , are armed with unity , political savvy , and courage ! the political insights offered by this film are invaluable . one gets clear examples of the private media , as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda . we see the poor people of caracas grappling with the brutal realities of `` american politics '' . one gets a clear sense of impending doom , if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny , which has been abruptly , and illegally , thrust upon them by the conspirators . we also see the arrogance and fascism , of the cia backed , private media , plutocrats , and generals , who 've conspired to bring venezuela back under washington 's domination . though ably led by president hugo chavez , the people of caracas are forced to act without him , after chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals . their response is the highpoint of the film . if one seeks an excellent portrait of what the u.s. government , hugo chavez , and revolutionary venezuela , are all about , this movie is it !
this film is scary because you can find yourself relating to ideas they have and can recall other people saying and having simialr ideas make this a haunting well done movie .... the camra style is not shakey to point it draws you out of film like blair witch it only adds to the raw `` real '' feeling of the film that makes it .
this is one amazing movie ! ! ! ! ! you have to realize that chinese folklore is complicated and philosophical . there are always stories behind stories . i myself did not understand everything but knowing chinese folklore ( i studied them in school ) it is very complicated . you just have to take what it gives you ..... enjoy the movie and enjoy the ride .... hooray ! ! ! !
esther williams gets her first post mgm starring role and gets off to a good start . this film is a well acted entertaining suspense with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more in the future - innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater . esther looks great and if she wanted to , probably could have gone on to do more and better films but according to her autobiography , pretty much gave up working for marriage . either way she is so likable and engaging that its fun to see her in a totally different role outside of the 'swimming musical ' . universal was fabulous for making films with former mgm stars after that studio began dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill . stars like lana turner , june allyson and others got to make quality first rate films at universal as they obviously still had drawing power at the box office . i wish esther had made more but since she didnt , it makes this one all the more special .
`` who done it ? '' contains many surefire laughs and gags . it is not only one of the best stooges films with shemp , it is one of the finest short comedies columbia produced . director bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the stooges , but when curly howard suffered a career-ending stroke , it was tailored for the columbia comedy team of schilling and lane ( their version was released as `` pardon my terror . '' ) it obviously was too good for the stooges to pass up , and it was finally filmed by the stooges at the end of 1947 . old man goodrich calls ace detectives shemp , larry , and moe out of fear that he will be murdered . when they arrive at his home , goodrich has disappeared , and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the stooges . will they find goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice ? shemp is particularly funny in this film . his reactions after being given a mickey by christine mcintyre are superb ; he gives his trademark sound ( eeeb-eeeb-eeeb ) and miss mcintyre is noticeably trying not to laugh ! other funny scenes : the close-up of moe 's mug looking through the camera lens ; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved . nikko the goon ( played by duke york ) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a stooges film . with his kinked hair , he could almost pass for a stooge , if he did n't tower over everyone else ! `` who done it ? '' is a gem among the stooges films with shemp . even die-hard curly fans will enjoy this one ! a true stooge classic . 9 out of 10 .
here 's another film that does n't really need much of a recommendation . it 's a classic comedy , very funny and entertaining and which , of course , ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even better ( i enjoy both , personally ) . for some , it 's hard to warm up to jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix unger and oscar madison when they were were weaned on the tv show starring tony randall and jack klugman ( or perhaps vice versa ) . but what we 've got there in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own . it 's neil simon 's humorous material that 's key , and where the laughs really originate from . for those who have somehow never heard of the odd couple , it 's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat-freak ( lemmon ) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife and takes up residence in the manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy ( matthau ) . pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely funny predicaments .
the first time i came upon delirious , i only heard it . i listened to the entire comedic performance and never have i laughed so much in my life . eddie 's ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and do great imitation is captivating . when i finally got to see him perform this act , i had to have it . eddie murphy 's performance on delirious shows his genius ! with it being the new millennium , his acts in 1983 is just as funny today as it was then . my parents loved it as teenagers and i ( age eighteen ) love it as well . from that point on , i had to view murphy 's other movies such as coming to america and harlem nights . there will be no other comedian like eddie .
loretta castorini ( cher ) is a woman in her late thirties , a widow , who lives with her parents in a duplex apartment in brooklyn . she is engaged to marry johnny cammareri ( danny aiello ) , a bland man , more out of a resigned duty than actual love . before their wedding johnny takes a trip out to visit his mother who is sick and leaves loretta the function of playing the olive leaf with his brother ronny by notifying him of their impending wedding . ronny ( nicholas cage ) has n't forgiven johnny for being the cause of his accident which caused him the loss of his hand ( and subsequently , his then-bride-to-be ) , but he does fall for loretta , and hard . after a heated affair loretta out of respect for johnny tries to avoid ronny , but his dark looks and overpowering masculinity win her over . meanwhile , loretta 's mother rose castorini ( olympia dukakis ) is not only suspecting her husband cosmo ( vincent gardenia ) is seeing another woman , but is also herself the subject of admiration from a college professor and wonders why do men chase women . things get complicated when johnny returns from sicily to tell loretta they ca n't be married . the setup is pure sitcom , but the story , written by john patrick shanley with a deep understanding for italian-americans living in new york , is genuine : he gets the idiosyncrasies of these people and their day-to-day foibles and quirks , and all of the characters have a deep romanticism that comes through in key moments throughout the story . loretta , a character hardened by the loss of her husband and knowing her chances of happiness are slim , slowly emerges as a woman who is so swept by the sudden recognition of love she becomes the heroine of la boheme -- the one who acknowledges the love of the man with the wooden hand ( in a clever gender reversal ) , and cher inhabits the role and makes it hers and in her own style subtly trades her frumpiness to a deep , dark beauty . ronny is pure fire and nicholas cage exudes masculine power as if he were channeling marlon brando . the castorini 's and the cappomaggi 's , counterbalancing the central couple , both express their love for each other in two very crucial moments : the latter couple , on the night of the full moon when loretta and ronny consummate their affair -- a rare scene depicting love and intimacy among the elderly -- , and the former at a tense moment over breakfast when rose bluntly reveals , in touching words , that she wants cosmo to stop seeing his mistress mona ( anita gillette ) . moonstruck is not only the romantic comedy and date movie of choice , but also a beautiful examination of love and passion among regular people . the ending is a tour de force of emotional impact , the family situation going beyond the momentary complications to cement it in tradition going back to the days of immigrants , and is one that elevates this movie from being just another feel-good movie to a classic . moonstruck deservedly got its oscars for best writing , actress , and supporting actress , and has proved to grow beyond its time .
zombi 3 has an interesting history in it 's making . firstly , it is a sequel to fulci 's hit zombi 2 , with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing ploy to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a. romero 's dawn of the dead aka zombi . confusing enough ? basically , none of the films have anything to do with one another , but who cares when they make money . i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out . bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to lengthen the running time . zombi 3 's plot is your typical zombie fare . scientists develop a serum on an island in the philippines , terrorists steal it unleashing a plague , and zombie run amok . the scientists want to create an antidote , while the military is set on mowing down everyone without prejudice . there are also brief inserts of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet . overall , i actually liked this film . i heard horrible things , but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable . the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about pollution , corrupted military , man playing god , etc . i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film , but it veered off in a weird direction , presumably when mattei came on board . besides ripping off other zombie flicks , this was very reminiscent of romero 's the crazies . you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with , `` when you see the men in white suits & gas masks , run to them for help . '' this is of course played to the images of the men in white gunning down zombies . later , they straight up steal a scene from crazies in which one of the regular , uncontaminated people is killed by mistake . the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner . how is it cool ? let me count the ways 1 . zombie birth 2 . flying zombie head 3 . zombie birds . 4 . zombie with no legs swimming in a pool . my favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the gas station . he was bad ass and nearly tore down the entire building trying to kill a girl . favorite quote  when a sergeant insists on cremating a zombie , the scientists asks , `` do n't you think that once the ash is in the air , it will fall to the ground , and contaminate everything ? '' to which the sargeant boldly replies , `` now you 're talking science fiction . '' he also continues to mention the `` science fiction '' told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies . extras : gallery , trailers , and interviews , most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40 % of the scenes , yet can not recall which ones or any other significant details . bottom line : a must see for zombie and fulci fans . rating : 7/10 molly celaschi www.horroryearbook.com myspace.com/horroryearbook
this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue . what dialogue there is appears in word baloons as it would in the manga . the plot of this is existent but only vaguely accounted for . there is an issue of the manga on which this is based available in english in the blast books collection , 'comics underground japan ' , and it has actual captioned dialogue that explains the plot a bit more than here . i recommend checking that volume out if you liked this , as it explains some of the `` plot '' of the movie , which is otherwise inexplicable . animation wise this is pretty decent , good unintrusive use of computers and the images are for the most part realized well . it jumps in and out of episodes , as the characters , a cat and his brain-dead older sister cat wander in and out of a series of odd images : a boat , a circus , a desert . for a mere half hour they go through a number of semi-plots and settings , which leads me to believe that the director chose a number of issues of the long-running manga to adapt at random , but primarilly selected visually . knowing what 's going on might somewhat increase appreciation . this reminds me mostly of the kind of stuff they used to play on the mtv show , cartoon sushi , in particular a short that features a cat chasing a man 's severed butt-cheek around the house . only in this case the cats resemble hello kitty more and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes [ though not all that easy to tell what 's going on ] . the dvd of this has director 's commentary and a `` making of '' features , but i cant comment on those because i didnt get around to them . i 'm giving this a 8/10 for now , here isnt much to compare it to in anime , and i hope for more like this .
reese witherspoon plays dani , a young country girl that falls madly in love with the new 17 year old neighbor , court , played by jason london . court tries his best to make dani realize that the difference in their ages would make a love relationship improbable . soon the nubile charm of dani starts winning over court 's will . next enters the meeting of dani 's older sister , played by emily warfield , and the beginning of a short lived love/jealousy problem . tess harper and sam waterston round out the cast . this is a fresh , free spirited ; but heartbreaking drama that touches down deep . feel free to cry .
if you are a fan of zorro , indiana jones , or action in general this is a must-see . directed by republic 's ace team of william witney and john english , and starring reed hadley as don diego/zorro , this serial delivers ! i wo n't bore you with the plot ( who cares ? less talking , more fighting ) ; what really matters here is hadley 's superb interpretation of the character/s and the stunt work of dale van sickel and yakima canutt . * * * stunt spoilers follow * * * you can see the influence this film had on lucas and spielberg -- zorro gets caught in the original version of the star wars trash compactor in one chapter , trapped on a rope bridge a'la temple of doom in another , does a raiders horse-to-coach transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the baddies knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him , exactly as mola ram does to indy in temple of doom . in addition to all this , the whip action is great as zorro disarms villains , swings to safety , etc . with his trusty lash . most of the sword work is fair to lame , except for chapter one , which features a terrific sword brawl in a cantina choreographed by sword/stunt legend ralph faulkner , who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil rodriguez . this was the first serial i ever saw , on matinée at the bijou when i was a kid and i have been hooked on them ever since . zorro 's fighting legion delivers `` z '' goods !
if you enjoy cleese & all the british 'pythonesque ' humour of the time , then this little gem is absolutely hilarious . arthur lowe is a real treat ! i saw this with friends on tv when it first came out , and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for 30 years , and will do forever ! i have it on tape and it is continually appreciated . perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously . i ca n't believe it is now only available in the us ( ntsc of course ) , and not in uk , where it should be an essential part of the history of british humour ! !
in april of 1965 , cbs broadcast the first of barbra streisand 's monumental television specials . the show was not only a runaway ratings success , but garnered 5 emmy awards as well . this is one of the most memorable moments of 1960 's television and ( unfortunately ) the kind of television special they do n't produce anymore . filled with wonderful songs and a spectacular performance by barbra , this special is a must view for any streisand fan and anyone interested in early television .
this is one of my favorites along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing `` sandy '' and the agnes moorhead-and-the-tiny-spacemen episodes . it is an important take , from mid-1961 , on the long cold war that the u.s. was then embroiled in . the beaten-down city-scene , the near-starving characters ' sparse dialog , their threadbare uniforms , and the minimal action `` says '' it all : the absurdity of an on-going conflict that threatens to destroy human life , modern civilization , and all that is sweet and redeeming about it . it is a `` fable '' because it was made in a time in which , had events turned out differently , such as the second berlin crisis ( spring 1961 ) and the subsequent cuban missile crisis ( oct. 1962 ) , it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u.s. 's major cities , ruined and replete with a few miserable survivors . i also see it as a `` fable '' because it is not only a cautionary tale , but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths : it is a love story , set in an impossible situation , and involving two highly mismatched lovers .
i loved this movie ! it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it , but it is really very uplifting . i was struck by the performance of ray liotta , but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying ray 's twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event . but tom 's character , though heartbreaking , knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life . this is a great movie , do n't miss it ! !
i like this movie a lot , but it 's a fact , that you can not understand it , unless you 're from the ex yugoslavia . most of the actors are now dead and those were the best actors in ex yugoslavia . i appreciate that this movie is now on divx and i can have it in my collection . macedonia . serbia . montenegro . bosnia and herzegowina . croatia . slovenia . all of this was ex yugoslavia , a melting pot of the balcan nations . it could be a dream land , if slobodan milosevic , franjo tudjman and other nationalists would n't poison the nation 's mind with their sick ideas .
dr. mccoy and mr. spock find themselves trapped in a planet 's past ice age , while capt . kirk is in the same planet 's colonial period . however , it 's the former pair that has the most trying time . besides the freezing temperatures and sanctuary to be found only in caves , there is a third inhabitant , the beautiful and so sexy zarabeth ( mariette hartley ) . as spock spends more time in this era , he slowly begins to revert to the behavioral patterns of his ancestors , feeling a natural attraction to zarabeth and throwing `` caution to the wind '' about ever leaving this place . only with dr. mccoy 's constant `` reminders '' does spock hold on to some grasp of reality . this stand as one of the few times when the character gets to show some `` emotion '' and nimoy ( spock ) plays it to the hilt , coming close to knocking the bejesus out of deforest kelly ( mccoy ) . surprising to previous installment , captain kirk ( william shatner ) was n't allowed to get the girl , another plus for this one . perennial `` old man '' ian wolfe assays the role of `` mr. atoz , '' the librarian responsible for sending the trio into the past .
eddie murphy delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing i have ever seen in my life . when i saw it for the first time about 2 years ago i was in stitches for weeks after it . to date i have seen it a further 17 times and i still laugh my ass off each time . for those who dont know eddie murphy was a brilliant stand up comedian before he was a hollywood superstar . there is not one dull spot in this piece of genius unlike eddie murphy raw which was released in 1987 which goes flat during the middle . if you are not the sort of person who ca n't stand swearing then i would n't advise you to see it as you will probably hear swearing of some form every 5-10 seconds . i gave this a 10 out of 10 because it displays the greatest comic genius of them all at his best .
anyone interested in pop music , and not familiar with british music trends of the late-seventies , should be sure to watch breaking glass at least once . the movie , about a young woman 's quest to make her mark in the music world , captures the times perfectly , from the overt sexism , rough economic times , social upheaval , to the shift in pop culture from rough-and-tumble punk to terribly fey and pretentious futurism/new romanticism . the music and fashion styles created daily in britain in the late-seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled ( there really has been nothing new since 1980 ) . this was a dazzling time , and breaking glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape , and does both extremely well .
the straight story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of america . at one level a slow walk through the heartland , it 's kind inhabitants , and amber grain , at another level about growing old and remembering what is important ( and actively forgetting what is n't ) . david lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me to remember that so much can be said with silence . a remarkable movie that will rest gently with me for some time to come .
i never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes ! when i first purchased casper & friends : spooking about africa , i so much wanted to see the very first casper cartoon entitled the friendly ghost ( 1945 ) , but when i saw the next cartoon , there 's good boos to-night ( 1948 ) , it made me break down ! i could n't believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing casper 's fox get killed ! i never saw anything like that in the other casper cartoons ! this is the saddest one of all ! it was so depressing , i just could n't watch it again . it 's just like seeing lassie die at the end of a movie . i know it 's a classic , but it 's too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me ! if i wanted to watch something old and classic , i rather watch something happy and funny ! but when i think about this casper cartoon , i think about my cats !
how to lose friends and alienate people is decent comedy with a bit of romantic approach . it 's actually a story of sidney young ( simon pegg ) breaking through in journalist and magazine writing business which is interpreted in a funny way . simon pegg made an ok appearance , slightly worse than his usual . movie is not hilarious or funny all the way or anything like that but it has its moments , and those moments are really hilarious . i recommend this fun and worth watching american with english cream comedy to all people who just wan na sit , relax and enjoy movie for what it is . if you 're about to watch this movie with critical approach then you should pass unless you want to be disappointed and start trashing it .
holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world ( some 2 million children are trafficked every year ) and does so sensitively and without manipulation -- a tall order that the team at priority films does with great success . american actor ron livington stars in the film alongside newcomer thuy nguyen , a vietnamese actress who plays holly , and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in cambodia . although it tackles a heavy topic , the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close , keeping the two-hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch . i am glad a film like this is bringing the world 's attention to the problem . child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step . it 's great and a film everyone must see .
even though i 'm quite young , the beatles are my absolutely favourite band ! i never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can remember . it 's the sort of film that is worth trying the once . i can see why it was n't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv . i was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film , it did n't much details except something like , 'john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up , jared harris stars ' . i 'd never heard of him ( he played john ) or aiden quinn who played paul . however they are certainly underestimated actors ! the film had a slow start but as it developed , i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters . as a huge fan , i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like . the script was brilliant and harris got lennon 's accent , personality and mannerisms spot on ! quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent . the make-up artists made them look excellent . this paragraph may be counted as a * spoiler * : as i mentioned before , it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film . i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians . as for lennon 's rude line in the italian restaurant , totally unnecessary . the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it . it is quite different from the other biographical films i 've seen where it 's about how the beatles got together and became famous , and those never really did the characters that well . e.g . 'backbeat ' . in conclusion , i would say , if you 're a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan , give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise . at only about 95 minutes long , it 's worth waiting for the film to develop . if anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the 'comments page ' for this film , i 'd be very interested .
to bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as braveheart . though it is a very different kind of film , the conflict between scottish commoners and english nobility is front and center here as well . roughly 400 years had passed between the time braveheart took place and rob roy was set , but some things never seemed to change . scottland is still run by english nobles , and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them . rob roy is handsomely done , but not the grand epic that braveheart was . there are no large-scale battles , and the conflict here is more between individuals . and helpfully so not all englishmen are portrayed as evil this time . rob roy is simply a film about those with honor , and those who are truly evil . liam neeson plays the title character rob roy macgregor . he is the leader of the macgregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the marquis of montrose ( john hurt ) . things look pretty rough for the macgregor clan as winter is approaching , and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone . rob roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the marquis and purchase some cattle of his own . he would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community . sounds fair enough , does n't it ? problems arise when two cronies of the marquis steal the money for themselves . one of them , known as archibald cunningham , is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film . played wonderfully by tim roth , this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the marquis by his mother . this man is disgustingly effeminate , rude , heartless , and very dangerous with a sword . he fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility . he rapes macgregor 's wife and burns him out of his home . this guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come . along with another crony of the marquis ( brian cox ) cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts . though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened , the marquis still holds macgregor to the debt . this sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity . spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! ! luckily for the macgregor 's , a duke who is no friend to the marquis sets up a final duel between rob roy and cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all . this sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed . cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace . and for most of the fight , it looks like these attributes will win out . just when it looks like rob roy is finished , he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner . the first time you see what happens , you will probably be as shocked as cunningham ! rob roy is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and perfectly paced . the score is quite memorable , too . the casting choices seem to have worked out as jessica lange , who might seem to be out of her element , actually turns in one of the strongest performances as mary macgregor . the film is violent , but there is n't too much gore . it is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior , however . the nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy . the film has no obvious flaws , thus it gets 10 of 10 stars . the hound .
although critically maligned , johnny dangerously is one of the funniest movies i 've ever seen . it 's a movie that should be watched closely ; some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them . for instance , keep an eye on michael keaton 's use of the pricing gun at the pet store ... and also on the documentary-style years that appear at the beginning of scenes . it 's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly , even though you know it 's a comedy . amy heckerling , the director , is really sharp here -- if you enjoyed her better known films ( fast times at ridgemont high , clueless , european vacation , etc. , ) you should give this one a look . michael keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast ( griffin dunne , maureen stapleton , joe piscopo , peter boyle ) is excellent . highly recommended .
this film is great . as often heard , it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal , but unlike some other people i am clearly not of the opinion that it is depressing , negativistic or dismantling austria as a proto-fascist society . quite the contrary : while there are indeed some very heavy scenes in hundstage and some characters are to be called very bad persons , at the same time you watch love , beauty and humor in ulrich seidls film . and that 's exactly what distinguishes hundstage for me from other films that try to show the lives of the 'ordinary people ' in an intense , realistic way ; their hustle , their wishes , their dark sides : seidl clearly never tries to prove , that the lives of the working-class people are trash ! in my opinion , viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid of admitting , that nearly nobody 's live is as 'clean ' and 'normal ' as we would like other people to believe . and that every live has its dark and often depressing sides . the most beautiful scene : the old viennese man , watching his old girl dancing 'the oriental way ' , as he is calling it . i think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is , that 's proto-fascist : the characters in hundstage or viewers , who are turned off by the body of a 70+ year old woman , dancing with all her charms for her lover .
first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or , worse , slightly ridiculous . lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving , sexy , thoroughly engrossing tale of love , disaster and possible redemption , while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence . the core story is of mathieu , 18 , a solitary , introverted boy who meets cédric , brasher , more outgoing but just as lonely , while on holiday with his family . as the summer warms on , they fall in love and , when the holidays end , decide to live together . a year later , the relationship ends in catastrophe : cédric cheats on mathieu who , distraught , tries to take his own life . he survives and , in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met , this time cloaked in the chill of winter . if the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does : much of it is implied , all of it happens non-sequentially . the intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced , through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective . fortunately , the three time-lines used ( the summer of love , the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction ) are colour coded : warm yellows and oranges for the summer , an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside . both main actors put in excellent performances though , whilst it 's a delight to see stéphane rideau ( cédric ) used to his full capacity ( i 'm more used to seeing him under-stretched in gael morel 's rather limp dramas ) , jérémie elkaim ( mathieu ) has to be singled out for special mention : you can feel his loneliness , then his almost incredulous passion , then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia . beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could . the themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema : our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling ; our difficulty in communicating fully ; the shifting sands of meaning the film 's title `` presque rien '' ( almost nothing ) points to all of these and , indeed , to one of the key scenes in the film : in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself , a psychiatrist asks cédric if he had ever cheated on him `` non enfin , oui une fois , mais ce n'était rien '' ( no well , yes once , but it was nothing ) . cédric still loves mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt ( none of which we see ) and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but can not understand that he has lost him forever , because something that seemed nothing to him ( a meaningless affair ) is everything to mathieu . whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et gilles poster would suggest , it is not without hope : we get to see cédric 's slow , painful attempts to get back in touch with life , first through a cat he adopts , then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre , who may be his next love . but here the story ends : a teenage passion , over within the year , another perhaps beginning . so what was it ? almost nothing ? certainly not when you 're living it
i loved watching `` sea hunt `` back in the day , i was in grammar school and would get home do my homework and by 4:30 would be ready to watch `` sea hunt `` and mike nelson in his underwater adventures .i loved it ! he took to you a place not very accessible at that time , under the great blue sea . pre `` thunderball `` or even before cousteau became common , there was mike nelson sparking the imagination of kids .i 'd be willing to wager that more than a few kids developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences from watching this show .underwater photography also progressed , the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated thru watching this show . watch and enjoy ! ! !
greetings again from the darkness . insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist . how strange for most of us to see someone who must work ... no matter the conditions , else his reason for living ceases . to see goldsworthy 's sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic . this artist creates because he must - not for money or fame . it is his lifeforce . when you see his failures , energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon . it is not the dread of beginning again , it is that he takes his energy from his work . watching him create just to have nature takeover and recall his work is somewhat painful , but nonetheless , breathtaking . he discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same . when he says he needs the earth , but it does not need him ... i beg to differ . only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best .
call me adolescent but i really do think that this is a great series . if you have n't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest star trek series , you should definitely watch this one . perhaps more compelling than that of voyager 's caretaker , which launched the series with cpt . janeway , archer 's adventures are completely different , yet strangely familiar ... the music is catchy too . no true sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one star trek episode -- and these installments make the wait worthwhile .
what a perfect example of `` less is more ... '' kurt russell ( sgt . todd ) only has 72 lines , and something like 104 words . what a challenge ! like a black and white photo , when your mind 's eye has to fill in the blanks , the facial expressions , the physical drama , the emotive gesture , all combines to make a stronger impact . this is one of those top 5 movies i ca n't live without , right up there with the classics like road warrior . if you liked this , check out `` mad max 2 , the road warrior '' and `` braveheart '' both starring mel gibson . also `` gladiator '' with russell crowe and connie nielsen who was in soldier also . the `` thirteenth warrior '' starring antonio banderas and `` blade runner '' starring harrison ford .
ok the film was n't going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum , and it is a modern update on `` it 's a wonderful life '' . but it 's just come out as a cheap release on dvd and there are a lot worse ways of blowing $ 13 . you get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming b list celebs . however it 's an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just do n't think too much in it .
this movie is best described or compare to `` big fish '' ( the movie by tim burton ) . but it 's a less glamorous and more in you face tale . and of course here it 's not the father , but his grandfather who tells the stories . the movie 's narrative also moves back and forth ( so the story outline here at imdb , might tell you more than you would like to read , before watching the movie ) . it 's funny and engaging enough , even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too . it also surprises you here and there , with things you would n't expect . a nice little movie then , that deserves your attention , especially if you like movies like that ! : o )
still being of school age , and having to learn shakespeare almost constantly for the last four years ( which is very off-putting of any writer , no matter how good ) , i did n't really expect to enjoy this film when my english teacher put it on ; i thought it 'd be the typical english lesson movie : bad acting , awfully shot , badly edited and the dreaded awful old dialog , so , as you can tell , i was all but ready to go into a coma from the go . however , i watched and , much to my disturbance , found myself not only paying attention , but actually enjoying the movie too . this production of hamlet is possibly one of the best drama movies i have seen in a long time- and it really brings to life what i expect shakespeare wanted his plays to be like ( well , with the difference that this is cinema ) much better than my english teacher harking over the text ever possibly could . the story is good , the dialog seems to flow with an unexpected grace that is far from boring ( though a little hard to keep up with if you are n't used to shakespeare 's language ) and even the smallest parts are performed with a skill you would n't expect ; mainly , perhaps , due to the staggering number of cameos this movie has . brian blessed and charlton heston are as great as you 'd expect these two veterans to be , even in such small parts , but it is robin williams as osric and billy crystal as the gravedigger who really stand out , giving such minor parts an unexpected zest , as well as offering some comic relief amidst the tragedy . the main stars , of course , are also wonderful . kenneth branagh excels as hamlet , bringing not only the confusion and pain required to the roll , but also a sort of sardonic air which plays beautifully in the comic scenes , making the movie as a whole much more watchable . the other major players are also good , but it is kenneth branagh who stands head and shoulders above the rest in the title role . the set pieces , too , are often quite stunning , giving a refreshing change to the danky old castle corridors we 're used to seeing in shakespeare productions , as well as a real sense of the country around them . of course , the movie , taken as a movie in its own right , is not without faults , but no major ones ( the pacing is the only real problem i can think of offhand , as well as the prose for anyone not used to , as i said , shakesperean language ) and , especially when compared to the sort of shakespeare productions i 'm used to seeing in class , it really is quite brilliant . it 's even made me rethink my previous typical teenager stance on shakespeare , that his plays are boring ( i came to the conclusion it 's not the plays that are boring , merely the teachers who recite them in class ) . if only they made all of his plays into movies such as this one , english students in schools everywhere might have a higher opinion of the bard . overall 7/10
this film was just absolutly brilliant . it actually made me think . during the whole movie i was confused as hell . i loved everything about it ... it was just so confusing and so twisted and weird , it was hard not to love it . all of the actors were phenominal , and no one could have done a better job ... this is one of my favorites of the year ... it deserves an ocar .
this movie is not about entertainment , or not even a movie you want to see to pass the time . this movie is a genuinely a display of true love that can only come from god . one can not help but be touched deeply by looking at this movie . we have several dimensions of love that contributes to the value of this movie . there is the divine love of god that is beautifully portrayed . god 's love transcends the heart and mind and endures and is eternal . there is the love in a marriage . while the main character grapples with his wife 's disease , he realizes through god 's love that he loves his wife more than he could ever imagine . he knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated . finally , you have the love of child and parent . the kids in the family come together and realize that nothing else matters except that love conquers fear . dear friends , love is not love unless it comes from god , because god is love and love comes from god . talk to someone and let them know you love them . love does no good unless it is given to another . i pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of everyone who sees it . amen ! !
i would n't be surprised if soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre- revolution cuba as graphically corrupt as it was . merely reciting a few statistics is n't going to make it with the younger crowd . still , part one , which is almost entirely shot in the jungle , does capture the feel of that place , especially when traversing the mountainous areas of cuba . i liked del toro 's interpretation of che guevara 's personality . and the actor who plays castro , bichir , also did a great job , against all odds . it 's clear soderbergh does n't look down on these people , but it 's also clear he 's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis ' far removed from the recent past . some of the more important historical aspects contradict what i 've read . to my knowledge castro did not court the soviet union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the united states were exhausted . but on other aspects he is right on , especially as to the looting by the expatriates as the island went other rebel control . the country 's treasury was left empty .
the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil gaiman ( writer of mirrormask ) and it 's really a good story . i think it would appeal to any labyrinth , princess bride or 10th kingdom fan and yet it 's totally unique and stands up on it 's own . and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil gaiman . i wo n't spoil it for you . the main character , tristan ( tristran in the novel ) , is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie . the story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world . when there is a falling star tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with . he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too . three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again , and some bickering princes . it 's a really good story . it has humor and magic and beautiful , surreal scenes and visuals . it 's charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages . it 's simply magical . it 's a true classic fairy tale , the likes of which i have n't seen in cinema since the 1980s .
i viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend , my wife and her female friend . so i had views from all kinds of directions . mainly , the film made me laugh , the sexual tension was not really there and the only noticeable actors were tudor chirila and maria popistasu . yes , i do think she played her role well , even if the script was not appropriate . there were good romanian actors around , they just did n't have complex roles . i applaud puya 's entering the movie business . i do n't know why , but i think he 's a good guy , i just hope he 'll be a good actor . the wife loved the movie , though , and i think there might have been chords being played and to which i had no ear for . if the film tried to present uncommon sexual behaviors and their consequences in todays romania , then it failed miserably . there were no consequences . just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl , and the same story becomes just a boring , uninteresting plot . i have no idea why it got all those bafta awards . in my book , it should have gotten the `` better luck next time '' award . ( bafta=good luck in romanian ) .
it does come out of left field , and really is n't what you 're expecting . but i love that . the most memorable movie experiences come from being surprised , if you ask me . if you have n't been tipped off about the mysterious `` thing '' that makes these brothers so odd ... you 're in for a treat . the cast is fantastic , but not stretching so much that it 's palpable . the special effects come out of nowhere ( seriously , it 's like an oddly dark romantic comedy until they do -- then wow ) and they 're great . the overall cinematography is easy on the eyes , the editing and sound are very good quality , and the twisted story unfolds without clichés . while none of these aspects individually make it a blockbuster , the `` what the hell ? '' factor alone makes it a film treasure . the people who bash this movie make no sense . it 's one of those often-overlooked flicks of the 90 's that you 've either never heard of , or love so much you jump at the mention of its title . i 'm in the latter group .
as always , controversial movies like this have mixed reviews . you either love it or you hate it , and not everyone will like this movie . this shows the perspective of the killers , which is something i personally feel is something important to consider . you may hate them , you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate , but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspective . the movie is shot entirely using a hand-held camera , something that i think works quite well as it makes it more realistic . it is told completely from the killers point of view , from their `` missions '' to family outings , all leading up the big day `` zero day '' in which they are planning on a massacre at their school . zero day does not offer answers , but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves . our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred , but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing . they are shown to be surprisingly normal , typical teenage boys leading ordinary lives , and if we did n't know what they were planning we would n't expect a thing ( they make it clear throughout the whole movie that no-one else knows about their plan ) the acting is extremely good considering the two actors are complete unknowns . we can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future . despite how this is a fictionalized movie , one can not help but notice the obvious similarities to columbine . calvin and andre are scarily similar to eric harris and dylan klebold , ( not so much in looks , but in manner ) as someone who has researched columbine very extensively , i could see the similarities and it is almost certainly based on it . the actual massacre is shown through surveillance cameras at the school and is one of the most chilling things i have ever seen . i was completely in shock after seeing it , and its a feeling that stays around for a while . it is very realistic and well-done , and it is very difficult to watch . all in all zero day is an excellent movie , and i think everyone should at least check it out . in the past , we have always simply branded killers `` psychopaths '' and assumed that either they were biologically wired for disaster or had media influence , but as zero day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that , and we can never truly understand why tragedies such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers .
though i like e.e . `` doc '' smith 's books and david a. kyles books of lensman , the anime , which is loosly based on the books , is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair . though the story may seem familiar to sci-fi/fantasy buffs , such as some kid on an isolated planet inherits mystical powers and avenges the death of his family , it is quite an entertaining one nonetheless . plus , lensman was the first animated motion picture to use hand drawn and cg animation all at once . sure , it may look a bit outdated now , but it is still an innovation . if it were not for lensman , none of that would have ever happened ( personally , i think computer graphics look better in animation that live action . ) too bad they only released it on dvd/vcd in a few countries in the worls ( mostly on formats that are quite foreign and different ) . i just wish they release the lensman movie and tv series on dvd/vcd in every part of the world , not just certain parts . p.s . worsel rules ! i just think he is so amazing and neat looking as well .
when seeing this movie you should take notice to that it´s not a normal movie . it has no real story just characters , a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony . the dialogue is wonderful , you can just lay back and listen . the movie stands out thats why it´s hard to find a right way of describing it . thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed . i for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one-liners and things that differ from the `` normal '' . you can´t really put the finger on what´s so wonderful about it it´s just a comical world where gangsters rule . a place of love and danger . a movie that you can see more than one time .
what is wrong with you people , if you were n't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head . of course the film is n't a masterpiece , i do n't think it was aiming to be . it was fun and funny , i never watched the show when i was younger , i only recently saw one episode , and when i watched the movie , i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere . the movie seats were practically shaking , and the car sequences were good because it did n't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious . and jessica simpson is plain hot , i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences . all in all , i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd . people , enjoy it for what it is .
overall i would have to say that i liked the movie . some of the fight scenes are really good . especially the fight against leung ka-yan . one point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an asian to play a black man . i mean really . talk about bad taste . during a fight scene , you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing . otherwise , sammo copies bruce lee 's fighting moves perfectly . 5 out of 10 stars .
what can one say about elvira that has n't already been said in the world 's press ? the classic comedienne that is elvira delivers in her first full-length big budget comedy masterpiece . from the very first movie frame thingy , elvira packs an acting punch that clearly says film great .... eat your heart out , bette davis ! see a forlorn elvira , see an excitable elvira , see a jealous elvira , see a murderous elvira . you can do nothing but marvel at her acting prowess ! at the heart of this comedy masterpiece is elvira 's desire for las vegas show stardom . despite putting `` the boob back in the boobtube '' as a horror hostess ( with the mostest ) , elvira finds the small screen constrictive emotionally .... and physically ! nuff said , she packs up her kitbag and heads east .... a hotdog in one hand and a letter from her aunt 's lawyer outlining her inheritance 'windfall ' in the other . i 've seen this movie so many times , i can almost recite it verbatim .... ( verbatim would just be showing off ) ! grab a copy , laugh yourself silly , learn the lines .... why she did n't win the best actress oscar for this role is beyond me .
this film has renewed my interest in french cinema . the story is enchanting , the acting is flawless and audrey tautou is absolutely beautiful . i imagine that we will be seeing a lot more of her in the states after her upcoming role in amelie .
at a time in our culture where reality exposed as narrative is overpowering fiction as we know it on the small and big screen , `` apart from that '' is a film that exposes real life moments that feel more honest , fresh and innovative in there presentation than i have ever seen before . the usual spoon feeding conventions are non existent in this film , leaving a content audience to sit and watch these real life moments trickle one after the other on the screen . while watching the movie , and even upon post contemplation , it is hard to believe that these amazing performances where actually that , performances . every moment with the large cast of actors felt like the truth being exposed in their daily usual lives . even so , `` apart from that '' does not feel like a documentary or reality television , but instead transcends into a category of its own , with its unique cinematography and direction . i look forward to watching this new category of storytelling continue with other films by directors jennifer shainin and randy walker . this movie must be seen .
. . . or type on a computer keyboard , they 'd probably give this eponymous film a rating of `` 10 . '' after all , no elephants are shown being killed during the movie ; it is not even implied that any are hurt . to the contrary , the master of elephant walk , john wiley ( peter finch ) , complains that he can not shoot any of the pachyderms -- no matter how menacing -- without a permit from the government ( and his tone suggests such permits are not within the realm of probability ) . furthermore , the elements conspire -- in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic -- to leave the wiley plantation house vulnerable to total destruction by the elephant people ( as the natives dub them ) to close the story . if you happen to see the current release earth , you 'll detect the elephant people are faring less well today .
i was n't sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this . a smart , slightly twisted comedy that makes you think . i was n't quite sure how a director can create `` nothing '' , but leave it to mr. natali and the brilliant individuals at c.o.r.e . to create another low budget set that looks real ( as real as nothing can be ) . well worth your time and money , if you have the opportunity to see this , please go . you 'll be glad you did .
a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend . of course the sob is very good-looking , charming , etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman . watching jean pierre leaud 's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends . it 's tragic , and you know she 's going to end up very hurt , but there 's nothing you can do . leaud is brilliant . totally empty . a blank throughout , he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants . the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love , and the next morning he puts on a record and , very sweetly and charmingly , sings along to amuse her is brilliant . the `` what the hell am i doing here with this idiot '' expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come . it 's a long film , but see it in one go , preferably in a cinema . takes a while to get into , but then the time just disappears .
you sit there for a half an hour and watch a story , believing it all , then watch another half an hour of the same story utterly unraveling ... and then put back together again . brilliant . one of the most exciting feature films at the san francisco international film festival is a documentary . i do n't know if - other than andrew jarecki 's `` capturing the friedmans '' - there has ever been anything like anna broinowski 's `` forbidden lie $ . '' it features , exposes , defends , reveals , and questions everything about norma khouri , author of `` honor lost , '' the acclaimed and lambasted 2001 bestseller about honor killings in jordan . what is quite incredible and what makes the film so exceptional is that this `` exposure '' of khouri is made with khouri 's full participation . for the initial portion of the film , khouri presents her story about the supposed honor killing of a friend of hers in amman , the story of the book . she sounds completely believable , convincing . then her story is taken apart , exposed , by eminently believable and convincing people , such as women 's rights activists in jordan , investigative reporters there and in australia , where khouri lived for a while . khouri comes back and denies the accusations , taking a successful lie-detector test in the process . there comes another segment of devastating exposures - not to be specified here because that would lessen the shock value ... and then khouri comes back and faces the accusations ( not all , but the essential ones in the matter of the book ) . and the houdini act continues , with round after round in this heavy-weight , seesaw prize fight , surprise after surprise - and there is no `` happy ending '' in the sense of resolution . brilliant .
this movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story . i too can not understand why people would trash this movie . if you are a jerry bruckheimer fan , this movie may not suitable for u . this movie presents high degree of realism . the actors and actresses ' performance is examplary . not fake , just natural . no special sound.effects , so special side effects . the camera work is excellent , the music is oh so good . i ca n't wait to get the soundtrack . it leaves your body numb , like constant garderner.the directly has raw talent , certainly not a follower .
a longtime fan of bette midler , i must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites . bette thrills us with her jokes and brings us to tears with her ballads . a literal rainbow of emotion and talent , bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire , as well as new songs from the `` bette of roses '' album . spanning generations of people she offers something for everyone . the one and only divine diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented performer around .
this is apparently one of shemp 's first shorts with the stooges . ( this excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team ) . but the threesome 's comedic timing is at its honed best here . aside from the intense slapstick scenes , there are others more subtle , but just as funny . watch larry when shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot . or watch the real object prompting moe 's exclamation , `` oh ... highly polished mahogany ! '' emil sitka is at his bewildered goofiest . and the goon may look scary , but he 's somehow funny . he seems as frustrated and perplexed with the stooges as are `` regular '' people in other shorts . for shemp aficionados , this is a must have episode . it wo n't disappoint .
a great idea : 11 stories about 11 september . 11 directors from different countries with different results . ken loach talking about an immigrant ( as usual ) is just brilliant ( as usual ) . the frenchman does a very good job also , while the burkina faso film was a nice surprise . however , the israel film was a bit boring , and the mexican guy , well , he should quit directing and work in a mexican restaurant . 8/10
i absolutely love this movie and would really like to have it someday . it 's just a fascinating legend about an eagle who wears a turquoise necklace , i loved it and would like to see it again ! i do n't remember too much about it , but that a native american boy lives in a nice village with his family , and i do n't remember what happens , but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone . his sister packs him some food and he goes . while he 's out there , some other indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him , and he turns into an eagle . the legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace , it is the boy . i was always fascinated with legends , particularly native american legends and i would love to see this released someday to a dvd , please release it , whoever 's concerned !
how can you resist watching a film with some swing ? it 's a delightful little film full of wonderful actors and a wonderful story line . too bad they do n't tour out here ... i 'd go see them . see it if for no other reason than to hear some good music .
an american in paris is an integrated musical , meaning that the songs and dances blend perfectly with the story . the film was inspired by the 1928 orchestral composition by george gershwin . the story of the film is interspersed with show-stopping dance numbers choreographed by gene kelly and set to popular gershwin tunes . songs and music include `` i got rhythm , '' `` 's wonderful , '' and `` our love is here to stay '' . it set a new standard for the subgenre known as the `` songbook '' musical with dozens of gershwin tunes buried in the underscore . the climax is `` the american in paris '' ballet , an 18 minute dance featuring kelly and caron set to gershwin 's an american in paris , featuring an impressionistic period daydream in the style of various painters , is one of the longest uninterrupted dance sequences of any hollywood film . the ballet alone cost more than half a million dollars , a staggering sum at the time . it 's funny to think of such a work of art being born over a pool game between film producer arthur freed ( singin ' in the rain , wizard of oz , on the town , meet me in st. louis and the band wagon ) and ira gershwin . it was freed 's idea to buy the title so he could use if in a film about paris and gershwin 's idea that it would only use gershwin music . original cast was to have cyd charisse but she discovered she was pregnant before shooting began . a major reason gene kelly suggested leslie caron as the female lead was because he felt this movie needed a `` real '' french girl playing lise , not just an american actress playing one . gene kelly discovered leslie caron while vacationing in paris where he saw her perform in a ballet . when she got the call to audition , she said , `` who 's gene kelly ? '' according to leslie caron , her introductory dance sequence , which included a seductive dance with a chair , was considered too suggestive by some censors . gene kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences shown as lise is introduced . vincente minnelli first wanted maurice chevalier in the georges guétary part , and 'celeste holm ' in the 'nina foch ' part . minnelli was a groundbreaking director of musicals with meet me in st. louis ( 1944 ) , an american in paris , and the band wagon ( 1953 ) . he used color and songs in ways they had n't been used before . he used space and time imaginatively . best of all , though , he allowed himself to cut loose for the long ballet sequences that end all his movies . the ballet in an american in paris may be his best work . even though vincente minnelli is credited as the sole director , he was sometimes tied up with his divorce from judy garland and other directing projects , leaving gene kelly to take over the directing duties . other highlights include guetary 's rendition of `` stairway to paradise '' ; oscar levant 's fantasy of conducting and performing gershwin 's `` concerto in f '' ( see why it was oscar levant 's favorite . ) the ballet sequence , now that we know it was successful everybody now wants to take credit for it , freed , minnelli , kelly but before the film was completed the new york office of mgm said no to spending a half million dollars on a ballet . so freed went to studio head louis b. mayer himself and got him to agree , new york said no . finally gene kelly showed the new york office how a british film , the red shoes used a long ballet sequence and that film became a world wide hit  and is still considered today the premium example of a successful art film . well the financial guys finally gave in and signed the checks . there was a break in production after 1 november 1950 , at which point gene kelly began rehearsing the ballet choreography . by the time production for that final sequence resumed on 6 december , vincente minnelli had finished directing another film - father 's little dividend ( 1951 ) . irene sharaff designed a style for each of the ballet sequence sets , reflecting various french impressionist painters : 'raoul dufy ' ( the place de la concorde ) , edouard manet ( the flower market ) , maurice utrillo ( a paris street ) , henri rousseau ( the fair ) , 'vincent van gogh ' ( the place de l'opera ) , and henri de toulouse-lautrec ( the moulin rouge ) . the backgrounds took six weeks to build , with 30 painters working nonstop . roger ebert said after viewing the recent restoration , `` an american in paris has many qualities , not least its famous ballet production number , with kelly and leslie caron symbolizing the entire story of their courtship in dance . '' an american in paris is often compared to singin ' in the rain as to which it the greatest musical ever made , and one critic put it best when he said , `` singin ' in the rain makes me happy and an american in paris makes me feel good . '' the ballet represents kelly 's fantasies as depicted by the great french artists ( renoir , rousseau , lautrec , dufy ) he admires . arranging a screening for the then ailing raoul dufy , the actor and producer ducked out until the end credits . there , relieved , they found the artist , moved to tears , requesting a second helping of the sumptuous finale . the film was also the first to win a golden globe award for best motion picture ( comedy or musical . ) gene kelly received an honorary academy award that year for `` his versatility as an actor , singer , director and dancer , and specifically for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography on film . '' it was his only oscar .
i was really stunned how much a film , that 's over 60 years old could impress me . it is nearly two hours long , there are absolutely no stars in it , there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch . what impressed me mostly was the realism of the film . you could nearly feel the coldness of the ice , because you could see that the storms are real . this is a relief in a cgi-world like ourdays . i wondered how much work this must have been for van dyke . i read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it . now who wants to talk about 'titanic ' anymore ? it 's a great film with a great message and i would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects .
typical 90 's comedy , situational comedy similar to our modern day `` my family '' . thatcher being the height of most political jokes , bill ( belinda lang ) blames thatcher for anything she can . `` bloody thatcher '' possibly shared with most of us . david the typical teenager , cutting up brains with bread knives , jenny , the moody older teenage child , only interested in boys and more boys . bill and ben working as much as they can to keep their family afloat struggling within the economical climate of the early 90 's . granted the first two series were not as successful as the latter however , series 3 onwards is where it all kicks off with more laughs that i care to count . overall this show did n't get the best viewing times and they ought to have held on a bit longer . clearly they could n't have carried on after gary olsen died but i think they should get rid of `` catherine tate '' `` the office '' `` little britain '' and bring back the classics !
philo vance had many affinities with bulldog drummond he was a gentleman with the kind of polish and elegance only usually associated with the british upper classes and he was also independently wealthy but there were vital differences drummond was an adventurer , charming , gallant , lively vance could be pompous , slight1y dull and self-righteous there was a hint of fundamental cruelty in his manner `` the kennel murder case '' is the most impressive of the 14 vance films made between 1929 and 1947 the story of a murdered collector of chinoiserie , it has all the ingredients of the classic private eye mystery  exotic setting in the blue nose long island kennel club , three killings for vance to solve including a baffling `` locked room murder , '' the key to the whole affair , and plenty of suspects usually , a detective story setting have proved too static and talkative to make convincing movies even though they work well enough on the printed page , but here michael curtiz 's direction and the fine editing give the film a pace and urgency that make it altogether different from similar films of its type william powell 's elegance and suavity made him the perfect vance and although a year later he switched studios , he stayed in the same genre with the enormously successful and popular `` the thin man '' at mgm
steve carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices , family and pressure . by judging on the plot and cover art of the movie i was expecting a flat-out comedy , lots of laughs and unrealistic elements , but i guess i was wrong . sure the movie had some comedy , but it felt much more of a light drama to me and steve carell once again gave a great performance . the movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element i found . but , the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable . through-out , the cinematography was great , the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important . though , it came down to old , flat and predictable ending . i 'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie ( perhaps for the bad , even ) this movie would get better publicity . still a fun movie .
although dig ! was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated . the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post-'98 . and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked . the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film . that said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art . one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene . recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands .
most horror movies are in fact horrible movies . they get to be same ol'-same ol ' . same ol ' pack every minute with some cheap thrill ( usually 'splatter ' ) and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects . one of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience . for instance , i saw both of the recent mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second . it probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended , it grew roots . subtlety can be more terrifying . less is more . i first saw 'the woman in black ' on the a & e channel . after flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television i stopped to watch it . this movie almost has the feel of a 'masterpiece theater ' production . that was fine with me , i 've always preferred british tv & movies anyway . most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced . but the slow pacing helps give the story credibility . the special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy . the makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable . hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes-fangs-claws etc . hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity . the woman only makes about five appearances in the film . most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright . if she appeared too often , it could 've cheapened the mood that gets set . however this movie is so well made that through much of the film we 're led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible . the scene where she 'visits ' arthur kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror . this is just an extraordinary film that i think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made . i have a copy of 'the haunting ' , 'the changling ' and a zillion more . i have n't seen anything that tops 'the woman in black ' yet although i 'm still looking . this movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic ( like me ) a moment where i almost had second thoughts about the non-existence of ghosts . i joke to people that i occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that i 'd see her staring through my window , etc . maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate . this is how a really great horror film should be . like a lafanu novel , the woman in black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it , she 's squeezing the life out of you and then it 's too late . closest thing i have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen ... and it 's a terrible shame that this is out of print . i just paid over $ 40 for my second copy of this movie . it 's a major prize in my collection . now i 'm on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama .
election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by johnnie to . to marvellously casted simon yan and tony leung kar fai as lok and big d , as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for ho sing society , a 100 year old trial society . while lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times , big d is not only impatient , but also thinks that he is on top of everything . lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years . to have the total control of the gang , the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a dragon baton , which represents power and authority . big d was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members . he ordered his man to get the baton before it falls onto the hands of lok . while big d is getting the baton , lok has other plans for him . this is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed . johnnie to puts the greed of the human beings in the movie , where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one . however , no single bullet is used , hardly any gangfights are involved in election . it 's the battle of the wits that makes election stands out of the rest . apart from maggie shiu , the only actress in election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie , masculinity rules the whole movie . louis koo and nick cheung , who was seen in to 's previous film , are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively . together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script , it makes the only hk movie to represent cannes fil festival 2005 . election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie .
'capital city ' fans rejoice ! this first season of this series is now available from network dvd and i 've recently got my copy ! although very much an ensemble piece of key 'maverick ' trading floor characters 'capital city ' does present us with various moments through both its first and second season when each member of the team plays a significant part in a particular central or peripheral plot line . the cultural mix ( english , irish , american , german , polish ) of head trader wendy foley 's ( played by joanna phillips-lane ) group of staff is balanced with their own distinctive mannerisms , interests and personalities which helps to make the rather unfamiliar and , to most people , seemingly sterile subject of financial trading reasonably engaging through the engaging performances of the cast . in fact this seemingly dynamic young team of employees is in direct contrast to the rather staid and old-fashioned senior management of shane longman as represented by lee wolf ( richard le parmentier ) and james farrell ( denys hawthorne ) . i suspect that such an unconventional way of working as employed by wendy 's team would not have become a reality had it not been for youthful reclusive 'free spirit ' peter longman inheriting his thirty per cent stock in the company from his father and allowed a more trendy , relaxed modern way of business become a reality . to a certain degree wendy 's ( i am led to believe ) immediate supervisor leonard ansen ( john bowe ) follows the establishment in the traditional manner of running the company however his fondness for wendy rather sees him occupying the 'middle ground ' on most occasions . the main interest in the series , i believe , stems from the simmering romantic attraction between douglas hodge 's declan and the cool self-assured blonde haired german trader michelle hauptmann ( played by trevyn mcdowell ) which had viewers continually wondering if the situation between these two colleagues would develop beyond the close friendship/fondness that they undoubted have . looking forward to browsing through this title , and hopefully the second season of thirteen wo n't be too far away !
very few chess movies have been made over the last couple of years , but this one is more than just a chess movie its a story about the need to be loved and the need to win it , john toturro plays a psychologically challenged man , nothing matters to him accept 64 squares and 32 pieces , the game validates him as a person , when he looses a game he looses the one thing that makes sense to him and john torturro expresses this in a beautiful fashion , even the love of a woman was not enough to save him from his sad existence.it makes you wonder if there other luzon 's out there who obsess about the game , i am sure they are , if you are a chess enthusiast it wo n't hurt to watch it.its an intelligent piece of work laid out properly and executed well , it achieves its objectives , unfortunately i doubt if there will be sequel .
do you still love woody allen 's humor and sense of the absurd ? do you wait patiently for movies that get the plot going in the first five minutes instead of making you wait around ? if so , you will adore this comedic murder mystery . it has all the elements of a good mystery : sharp plot , a handsome suspect , romance , and intrigue , mixed together with enough laughs and winks at fate to keep even the most jaded of movie goers happy . with beautiful people and gorgeous homes and landscapes to ogle , this frothy movie is just the thing to take your minds off your troubles . as woody might say , what 's not to like ?
what 's with all the negative comments ? after having seen this film for the first time tonight , i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person 's day . when i saw that drew ( ben affleck ) might end up spending the holidays alone , i wanted to cry . you 'll have to see the movie if you want to know why . also , even though i liked tom ( james gandolfini ) and alicia ( christina applegate ) after awhile , if you ask me , they were real snobs . however , this film did make me smile and feel good inside . before i wrap this up , i 'd like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit . now , in conclusion , i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person 's day to any ben affleck or christina applegate fan who has n't seen it .
master director ching siu tung 's perhaps most popular achievement is this series , a chinese ghost story 1-3 . chinese ghost story stars leslie cheung in some distant past in china as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his `` collecting trip '' in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him . beautiful actress joey wang/wong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a domination of one powerful demon , a wood devil who collects human souls for herself/itself with the help of her beautiful ghosts . leslie and joey fall in love , and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans , they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives . this is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness . this film is no less full of magic than other films by ching siu tung . his masterpieces include duel to the death ( 1983 ) and the swordsman series , which all have incredible visuals and kinetic power in their action scenes . ghost story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere , which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost . the effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen . the camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has . there 's plenty of wire'fu stunts , too , and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films , i can not agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic , freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give . when people fly in these films , it means the films are not just about our world , and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form . the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm , but the problem is ( again ) that the characters are little too shallow and act unexplainably occasionally . leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm , deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement . also , the message about love and power of it is underlined little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewer 's mind to be interpreted and found . another negative point about the dialogue is that it 's too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason . that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies . people just talk and talk and it 's all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element . just think about the films of the japanese film maker takeshi kitano ; his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks , or makes other characters talk too much in his movies . this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts . otherwise , chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema , and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then . i give chinese ghost story 7/10 and without the flaws mentioned above , this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre .
79/100 . fred astaire and ginger rogers never made anything but great films together . although this is not one of their best , it is an excellent musical . there are a few outstanding musical numbers , good support from randolph scott . two notable appearances , betty grable and lucille ball make memorable early screen performances . ball is particularly good , and a blonde as well . the `` let 's face the music and dance '' is one of the musical duo 's best numbers ever . harriet hilliard , better know as harriet nelson of `` ozzie and harriet '' plays ginger roger 's sister . the basic plot is pretty familiar , but with a cast this exceptional , it works . excellent art direction and score .
this is by far one of my favorite of the american pie spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character ( one of the young stiflers ) always seems unrealistic in nature . for example ap : the naked mile . you have a teenage guy surrounded by naked college chicks , and has one in particular hot on his trail to rid him of his virginity `` problem '' and he ends up stopping mid-deed and rides a horse back to sleep with his girlfriend , who keep in mind gave him a `` guilt free pass '' for the weekend . i can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing but let 's be realistic ; most people who are watching these movies are n't particularly searching for a romantic story . whereas the most recent installment finally seems to realize who the audience is and good old erik stifler seems to wake up and smell the roses and as always mr. levenstein lends his `` perfectly natural '' eyebrow humor to the equation and scored a touchdown with this new movie .
this movie was one of the funniest movie i 've seen in years and the laughs from the audience members support me . not since my big fat greek wedding ( 2002 ) has the laughter been as spontaneous and intense . easily has intricate as last year 's mr. and mrs. smith ( 2005 ) in its use of parody ( espionage in mr. and mrs. smith and sex in my super ex-girlfriend ) . director 's ivan reitman balance between comedy and drama , between crazy and downright ludicrous is great . never does the shock and dramatic serious crack the rule of comedy . at the same time , this predictable romantic comedy never loses its touching emotional elements even if the ending is broadcast in advance . in some ways , it 's so evident that it 's great to see how it plays out . just like in real life , sometimes the truth is so evident that one ca n't really see it . easily eight out of ten stars ranking up there with tootsie ( 1982 ) . possibly a nine ( depends on how it appears on a second viewing ) .
i saw this film in winnipeg recently - appropriate , given the location used . i first read lawrence 's book back in the 70 's and for me , it 's always been a very powerful picture of the trials of aging in our society . it resonated when i was young , and it resonates even more now . when the film came out , i was keen to see if the story could survive . and was thoroughly impressed , especially with ellen burstyn 's performance . she manages to give us a complete human being , even though the character is generally cranky and judgmental - someone that you would n't want to live with . it 's great to be able to see favourite characters come to life so authentically .
this is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways . everyone in my family enjoyed it . the animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are plenty of producers who create films that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from the disney studio . one difference from the normal disney fare is that this dreamworks movie does not feature some wise-cracking side kick for comedy relief . and , there are no sudden moments where the characters break into song . i am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a disney picture : the birth of spirit . but it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all . `` spirit '' was a great breath of fresh air . do n't get me wrong . i have loved disney for years and will continue to do so . `` spirit '' is another example of great animated fare . as soon as it was over , my kids wanted to watch it again . i had the same feeling . i thoroughly recommend it .
this is simply one of the finest renditions of dicken 's classic tale . the script very accurately follows the story originally penned by dickens , and captures a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a play atmosphere . viewers fond of either format will find enough of the story rooted in their presentation style of choice . george c. scott brings a delightfully realistic approach to the character of scrooge , and is very convincing in the character development instigated by the visits of the ghosts . i found that he was able to win me over to the point where i sympathized with the old miser , something rarely done in other versions . the superb job done by the supporting actors add greatly to this production , which is simply the most enjoyable of all the christmas carol versions i have seen .
neither the total disaster the uk critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist , revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by guy ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers . but then , nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew , especially one using the gangster/con-artist movie framework . as might be expected from luc besson 's name on the credits as producer , there 's a definite element of 'cinema de look ' about it : set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where america and britain overlap , it looks great , has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style , all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment . but ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck , and he 's spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life , the universe and everything . if anything its problem is that he 's trying to throw in too many influences ( a bit of machiavelli , a dash of godard , a lot of the principles of chess ) , motifs and techniques , littering the screen with quotes : the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims , and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he did n't want to turn into a movie . rather than a commercial for kabbalism , it 's really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce , chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film 's central ( somewhat metaphysical ) con . the last third is where most of the problems can be found as jason statham takes on the enemy ( literally ) within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people 's exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger , but it 's got a lot going for it all the same . not worth starting a new religion over , but i 'm surprised it did n't get a us distributor . maybe they found ray liotta 's intentionally fake tan just too damn scary ?
i always enjoy this movie when it shows up on tv . the one scene that always stands out , for me that is , is the one with the myrna loy and the painters foreman , where she gives him very explicit instructions on the colours and as soon as she goes away he turns the his guys and says `` did you get that , that 's yellow , blue , green and white ''
best show since seinfeld . she 's really really funny . her total self centeredness , the hulking gay stoner neighbors , the departures into song or cartoons , make this the freshest show on tv . one of the few shows i make point of watching . the scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore ( `` oh wait now that you 're close you do look old '' turns face with finger and walks away lol ) , the cough syrup overdose , sleeping with god , it 's all so funny or so stupid it 's just a lot of fun . the shows weak points are her sister and the cop-only because they 're too darn normal ! ! i really ca n't wait until the next show , something i have n't felt for any show in a long time .
very good point there : `` only an elite few ( the upper classes ) would both have access to the internet and be able to communicate on an exclusively english speaking site such as the imdb '' some might think internet is not reality but this point of view really put media society and democracy at stake : you are probably right .. even if there is internet cafe 's in venezuela most chavez supporters will not afford to even rent a computer for half an hour to comment on imdb . screw you faschist upper class rich right wing capitalist liberal intellectual surpressors .. probably this is your first time using internet ; ) ..
i have lost count of how many reviews i 've written on slaughter high . i 've read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie . simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide , and even though this was his only film , he is what made the movie so great . at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide . then i found out due to the current webpage at www.imdb.com he was born in 1957 , in dayton , ohio . simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man , but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses . he did a good acting job , who can disagree ? i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie . must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least . i first saw this movie when i was 12 in the sixth grade . i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered , and that high schools do not have bath tubs ! i think caroline munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent , and unfortunately for simon 's death he made no future films . the reason ( s ) for his suicide are a mystery , and hopefully will be discovered in the near future . doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made slaughter high . he looked like a teenager . i give this film two thumbs up , the best horror film made . probably because of their horrible acting the others did n't make fame in the movie business . -jacob young
after `` a dirty shame '' , i never thought that i was going to see another john waters movie . that movie was really so bad , that i was convinced that all his movies would be like that . but when the dvd of this movie was reviewed in a popular magazine and they said that this was an excellent movie , i decided to give it a try anyway . only a couple of days later it was shown on television . i taped it out of curiosity and now that i 've seen it , i can tell you that this `` pecker '' sure is a lot better than `` a dirty shame '' . in this movie we see how a young 'nobody ' from baltimore becomes an overnight sensation in the art world of new york . he 's a sandwich shop employee who photographs his weird family or things that he sees on the street as a hobby . when he keeps his very first 'exhibition ' in the shop where he works , his pictures are noticed by a gallery owner who loves the pictures full of misery and weirdness . his photographs are sold for enormous prices , but when he sees how his family , friends and strangers react to his success he decides that he will no longer go to new york , they will have to come to him if they want to see more of him . and they do , but what they get to see there , is a bigger shock than they could ever imagine ... it 's not difficult to see why i loved this movie a lot more than `` a dirty shame '' . the first reason is that this movie has an actual story . this movie really has something to say and is n't just intended to shock as many people as possible . the fact that they make fun of the art world who considers everything out of the ordinary as art because they do n't know what the reality is like , is n't just funny , it 's not that far from the truth either . i guess there are many people who feel about modern art that way . nobody understands why they are making such a fuss about it , but apparently we are all supposed to like it . the second reason why i liked this movie is because this one had much better acting performances to offer . i 'm not saying that everything that you will see is great , but at least the characters have some meaning thanks to the performances of the different actors like edward furlong , christina ricci , ... overall this is n't a great movie , but thanks to its criticism and some good jokes - which never really go too far - this is an enjoyable movie . it certainly is n't the best comedy ever , but i liked it a lot more than `` a dirty shame '' . i give this movie a 6.5/10 .
the number of times i 've had tears in my eyes when watching a movie are few . and there is only one time when i have really cried and that was when i saw this movie . this movie has some kliches but i really do n't care . i cry even as i write this and it was quite some time since i saw it . it is perfectly acted and all the production values are good , but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message . we all know it in our hearts , but it is not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is love in all it 's forms . it 's only when we love that we 're truly alive . i know how sentimental i sound and i promise i 'm not usually like that . i 'm quite a cynic . this movie has brought out stronger feelings of both sorrow and happiness in me than any other movies and it will probably always be the first movie i recommend others to see .
to begin with , i loved göta kanal 1 , it had a lot of classic jokes including that unlucky guy in the canoe who always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time , he is still acting the same guy in the göta kanal 2 movie but in my opinion hes performance is not as funny as it was in the first movie , in fact you do n't notice him much at all . a thing that made me think bad about this movie is the choice of boats , in this movie there are only race boats , they sure is speedy but those do not make waves like the big floating mansions used in the first movie , i liked the old ones better and these new boats makes one of the last scenes look ridiculous when the man in the canoe suddenly jumps out of it to evade the `` big waves '' from those small speedy boats . truly a minus . you have to accept that we 're not living in the same sweden as in 1974 anymore . this movie also contains a bit more violence than the first one . although the movie was great all in all . i 've just concentrated on some cons that i was disappointed in but the rest of the movie were up to my expectations , so go see it ! it 's worth the money .
i 've seen mystery men cop a bit of stick in the press and with the general public ( take the imdb vote for instance ) , but my overall feeling is that mystery men is more fun than most films , definitely wittier than most so-called comedy films and very nearly 'clever ' . the cast is superb ; greg kinnear is excellent , as are geoffrey rush and tom waits . kinnear 's limo scene with ricky jay is perfect 'spoiled movie star ' and he imbues his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him work . i will admit the pacing is a little off in places , and visuals are certainly very flash bang , possibly to the detriment of further characterisation , but at the end of the day , this is high concept film making - it 's about the little moments `` what 's up tiger lily ? '' - and there are so many great ones in this film to make it worth repeated viewing .
mary pickford ( `` born on the fourth of july '' as angela moore ) is `` the little american '' ( of french heritage ) ; she falls in love with jack holt ( as karl von austreim ) , who had moved to america with his german father and american mother . french-american raymond hatton ( as count jules de destin of the `` fighting destins '' ) has fallen in love with ms. pickford . the love triangled threesome eventually wind up in france , with the great war ( world war i , in hindsight ) complicating their lives considerably . a mostly entertaining , if propagandistically flawed , cecil b. demille film . the torpedoing , and sinking , of a ship carrying pickford is `` titanic '' -like . the war intrigue gets dramatic as pickford slowly becomes an undercover spy for france , while the germans occupy her ancestral home . of course , german lover holt arrives . it was difficult to believe they took so long to recognize each other as he moved in for the rape , but it was dark ; and , prior events had them believe each other dead . the film goes way over-the-top in its symbolism . pickford was , by the way , canadian - though , few could deny she was n't a `` little american '' , for all intents and purposes . fun to spot `` extras '' who later became major stars include wallace beery , colleen moore , and ramon novarro - especially , watch for mr. novarro exhibiting `` star '' quality during one of the film 's more memorable sequences : pickford and the wounded soldier saluting each other as he is taken by her on a stretcher . novarro even gets mary pickford to write a letter for him ; obviously , he 's got a future in pictures . also future-bound is ben alexander , who plays the boy `` bobby '' ; he becomes a dependable child actor , and grows up to become a jack webb partner on `` dragnet '' . * * * * * * * the little american ( 7/12/17 ) cecil b. demille ~ mary pickford , jack holt , raymond hatton
this is , without a shadow of a doubt , one of the scariest and most intriguing episodes of doctor who . this is a thrilling psychological ride and you will probably find your own beliefs being thrown into question . riddled with spine-chilling moments , this is an episode no `` who '' fan can afford to miss . starting from when the pit was opened after the events in `` the impossible planet '' , the doctor and ida are trapped and are running out of air . with no other alternatives , they decide to find what lies at the bottom of the pit , an event which surpasses even the doctor 's expectations . whilst there , the doctor is forced to make what he considers to be the ultimate sacrifice ... meanwhile , rose and the other members of the planet try to find a way to fend off the ood , whose minds have been poisoned by the beast . also , is toby zed truly cured of his possession by the beast ?
this movie is gorgeous . it 's real and down to heart , but at the same time totally crazy . the characters are easy to fall in love with , because they have so many different minds , but each of us could refer to at least on . in canada , we do n't have many movies from eastern europe , and for the few i have seen , loners is one of the best . it 's very funny , and magic . if you want to see something new and refreshing , go see loners .
a single mother ( diane keaton ) finds herself working several minimum-wage jobs . when she gets fired , she finds that she is unable to support her sons ( michael seater and colin roberts ) , the latter of whom has asthma . then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs . soon enough , she gets addicted to the drugs that she is selling . her life comes crashing down , especially when her kids , namely her oldest son , find out the truth and threaten to leave her . then , she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her kids but can she protect her family from the drug lords who she worked for ? wow ! this lifetime movie has some of the best acting i have ever seen ! diane keaton overacts a lot , and her character comes off as crazy but she was extremely convincing . she is much better suited to drama than to comedy . however , the best performance in the movie comes from michael seater , who plays her oldest son . he is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but trying to be the adult in the family . his acting was especially great in the scenes where he confronts his mom about the drugs . colin roberts , who plays the younger son , also does a great job . a movie well worth watching , especially because of the acting from michael seater and diane keaton !
carl brashear ( cuba gooding , jr. ) was born to sharecroppers in the deep south . he joins the navy , whereupon he tells his father he will be back . the father gives him an old radio , and brashear leaves on the navy bus . the most valuable thing his unemotional father taught him was , `` never quit '' . after a recommendation from a white commander powers boothe ) , who admires his drive and guts , he gets sent to navy diving school at bayonne , nj . he endures harassment from his pals in uniform and from his trainer , chief navy master diver , billy sunday ( robert de niro ) , and from the commanding officer , called pappy , ( hal holbrook , who `` has almost as many loose screws as an old car '' . they all want to make him drop out , and the prejudice is quite fierce.the dangers of diving prove a further setback when he loses a leg due to an accident on board ship . despite this setback , he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective , and with the help of billy sunday , ( now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings ) , they train and he is able to become the first black navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the navy department hearing in washington , dc to determine if he meets the criteria . an inspirational movie , showing that determination can overcome all odds .

i cried my heart out , watching this movie . i have never suffered from any eating disorder , but i think this must be a very true picture . alison lohman is excellent ! she expresses these feelings amazingly well . my teenage years came back to me so vividly . anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or teenager will be able to relate to this movie . i recommend you all to see it ! the music is great too - i 've now discovered diana lorden . i 'm also looking forward to seeing alison lohman in white oléander , because i am positive she is perfectly suited for the role as agnes .
this for me was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of marion davies . she is not only gorgeous but hilarious in this film . ( i believe that lucille ball may have modeled her later career on davies ' style , that could be termed `` zany beauty '' . ) vidor 's direction is light but sure-handed , the story is a chestnut of course but the acting is marvelously contemporary , and the star-watching element for fans of the silent era , with many cameos , adds to the overall fun . it combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well . for all movie fans who have a knee-jerk reaction to watching silent films , sit through this one and it may change your attitude .
unlike another user who said this movie sucked ( and that olivia hussey was terrible ) , i disagree . this movie was amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! olivia hussey is awesome in everything she 's in ! yeah she may be older now , because many remember her from romeo and juliet , but she 's wonderful ! this story line may be used quite often , but it 's a unique movie and i 'll fight back on anyone who disagrees ! i enjoyed this movie just as much as i have any other olivia hussey movie . olivia 's `` my girl '' and i love her work . i saw this for the first time on saturday ( 4/14/07 ) and fell in love with it . not only because 's it 's an olivia movie , but because of it 's unique story line and wonderful direction .
this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge . i found the first 10 minutes a bit slow , but after that , the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living . some of the scenes are very funny . i do n't think that a non-bridge player would get the charm of this movie . some of the dresses are really beautiful , pity the movie is in black and white - i can only imagine what they would look like in color . the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious . there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that . watch it as soon as you can , and tell your friends about it .
i 'm a huge fan of the dukes of hazzard tv show . and i really enjoyed this flick . i enjoyed myself here a lot more than i did with other summer blockbusters . it 's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like `` lame plot '' and `` it 's much cruder than the show . '' does anyone remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode ? daisy makes incest jokes and bo says that luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage . the only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot . and as far as the plot goes . it was the perfect dukes plot . in fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any tv show that has migrated to the big screen . while sean william scott and johnny knoxville are n't exactly like their small screen versions , they do a great job and work very well together . i was n't too keen on burt 's boss hogg though . and i would have like a little bit more incompetence from sheriff roscoe . in the movie roscoe is a little ... scary . and who did n't have a smile on their face as the general lee is racing through the streets of atlanta and the back roads of hazzard ? folks , allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia , bikinis and car chases , you wo n't be sorry . it 's just a great dumb movie !
did n't know anything about the movie before watching and i think it was the `` no expectation '' factor that helped me endure at first and later like it more than i anticipated . the setting was interesting , strange but interesting . the storyline had gaps/jumps that i think throws the audience off a bit . there 's no great soundtrack playing in the background , creating the `` romantic '' ambiance . but they all did n't matter . the chemistry between emma and luis was simply exquisite . there was some inexplicable strange chemistry that i could n't resist ; i fell in love with it and here i am , writing this review . the subtle love portrayal by the two actors was superb , and i believe , that is the core of this movie . this movie is not an everyday romantic comedy ; in fact , not all of us will appreciate it . i had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things i did n't catch at first . i can not guarantee everyone will like it , but i hope you do .
a warm , sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop ( james stewart and margaret sullavan ) who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it . the key to this film 's success is that ernst lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low-key , unfussy performances . as a result , you fall in love with virtually all of them . there 's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which i appreciated . loneliness is a major theme , most obviously represented in the character of the shop 's owner and manager , played wonderfully by frank morgan . he discovers that he 's being cuckolded by his wife , and realizes that the successful life he 's created for himself is n't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he does n't have a partner to share it . this makes the timid romance between stewart and sullavan all the more poignant , because they 're both reaching out to this unseen other , who each thinks of as a soulmate before they 've even met . of course we know everything will turn out right in the end , but the movie does n't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality did n't live up to the fantasy . lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry . the little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family , and that 's exactly how it feels to us as well . this is a wonderful , unsung romance . grade : a+
i really liked this movie . of course the idea is pretty much out there ... the federal government arranging to have a tracking device implanted into the jaw of an small-time thief to lure a more dangerous thief/computer hacker out of hiding . but alvin sanders , the man who the feds have `` volunteered '' to be implanted with the device , is a very likable person and it turns out to be a lot of fun getting in his head with him for a little while . alvin even eventually proves himself to be much more than a good-humored but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not nearly as easily manipulated as he may seem . definetly worth a watch .
i remember watching this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old , but the weird thing is that i never watched it after that . the other day i was babysitting and my cousin never saw all dogs go to heaven so we rented both movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies . so many memories came back watching this movie once again and i have to admit i even cried a little . i 'm 22 years old and the ending still gets to me . all dogs go to heaven is one of the most touching animated films and i 'm shocked honestly by this rating of 5.8 , i thought this movie would bring back good memories for others as well . i admit the animation was a bit typical but the story is just so charming and fun . charlie is a gambling dog who gets killed by another gambling dog , carface . but when charlie wants revenge he comes back to earth with a watch that ca n't stop ticking or that 's the end of his life again . when he and his best friend , itchy , look for carface and spy on him they find out how carface gets all his money , he has a little orphan girl who talks to animals and finds out who is going to win the races . charlie takes the girl , ann-marie , and makes fake promises in order to get the money . but he ends up learning that maybe he should put ann-marie first before himself when carface goes back to him with a vengeance . all dogs go to heaven is the perfect family film , it 's not disney , but this is an excellent family film to watch . not to mention that it 's just so cute and touching . i know it 's ridicules and some people call me crazy , but this movie for me when i was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls . how could they not ? they 're just so loving , and i think i 'm going to cry again . but anyways , i would just recommend this movie for anyone , it 's a fun movie to watch . 7/10
this episode of twilight zone combines a silent section ( 1890 ) with melodramatic acting and sight gags , an homage to the early buster keaton films . lots of slapstick : buster falling on a bulkhead door , falling in a puddle , running around pants-less . silly scientist 's invention of a time helmet , reminiscent of a flash gordon idea of what the future would be . cheap prices , like $ 1.95 for ladies hats , or 17 cents a pound for beef seem outrageously high to buster . even the world of 1890 is too much for buster/mulligan . how shocking when he is mistakenly transported to the `` modern '' world of 1960 ! buster was trying to go backwards ! the `` scientist '' of that time wants to return to a calmer world , the 1890 that he has studied and admired . they go back together , and buster/mulligan is now happy and the `` scientist '' regrets not having electronic equipment , modern beds or an electric blanket . so buster sends him back with the crazy helmet . this twilight zone does n't have a heavy message . since buster keaton died in 1966 , it is one of his last efforts . that 's enough . one other cute thing -- longtime underutilized maytag man jesse white is a repairman who fixes the time helmet -- foreshadowing his washing machine career .
police story is arguably one of the best works by the master of action himself.compared to other action films , police story makes schwarzenegger and stallone look like beginners.the stunt scenes are well cheorgraphed and the action scenes are superb.if new line cinema has any sense , they would release this in theaters .
an enjoyable batman animated film . not on par with `` return of the joker '' or `` mask of the phantasm '' , but solid nonetheless . i liked how the movie kept you guessing as to who batwoman was . there was nice twist . nice action sequences . i 've always been of the opinion that the batman cartoons are better then any of the pitiful batman live action film sequels . the trend continues here . 7.5 out of 10
this is what makes me proud to be british . this is by far the funniest thing on tv . the league consists of jeremy dyson , steve pemberton , mark gatiss and the lovely reece shearsmith . totally underrated , this horror-comedy is perfection . the characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre , `` hello dave '' . it is a comedy that everyone simply must watch . the best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh , and always pushing the boundaries . it does not need to rely on catchphrases ( unlike little britain ) for it to be funny . the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters , shows us that they 've got balls of steel .
'before the devil knows you 're dead ' is one of the best movies i 've seen in a long time . the acting from the excellent ensemble cast is incredible . philip seymour hoffman putting in an outstanding performance and is electrifying every time he 's on screen . ethan hawke matches him scene for scene and albert finney simply chews up the screen . marisa tomei is , however , criminally underused , but looks amazing for her 42 years . the script is excellent , the story-line non-linear but easy enough to follow . sidney lumet , although not known for his blockbusters , has turned out a gem with this one !
what we 've got here is a situation . a man is found to be in distress and people want to help him -- in contrasting ways . at the end they are forced to let it go . you ca n't fix people . and though in various aspects reign over me is conventionally hollywood , that message is n't . this story is not about charlie fineman ( adam sandler ) , a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 plane who 's gone into a nearly psychotic state of ptss since . it 's about what meeting charlie does to alan johnson ( don cheadle ) , a dentist in new york who was his roommate in dental school and , knowing about his tragedy , spots him on the street and reconnects . charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter -- a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating manhattan traffic -- with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair . the hair is sandler 's chief prop to show he 's deranged . and the use of music as an escape must hit home to every ipod-wielding subway rider . charlie is a disaster , but paradoxically alan , stuck with a controlling wife ( jada pinkett smith ) , soon begins to envy him . charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund ( insurance money from the tragedy ) , and starts dragging alan off to `` hang out , '' `` eat chinese , '' buy records , or watch a mel brooks marathon at a rep house . charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady , redoing the kitchen over and over , collecting old vinyl of springsteen , the who , etc. , and playing a video game called shadow of the collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room . charlie 's in-laws are deeply concerned about him , but also somehow resentful , as we learn later . alan has a new patient who is propositioning him . charlie 's desperation makes us see alan 's . trying to help charlie partly permits alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them . cheadle and sandler make an odd couple , but that does n't matter , because it 's convincing that they might both need each other . charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family , because to escape his loss , he is pretending he never had one . and so what if as a roommate charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste ( no motown ) ? alan wants an escape from his tidy , emasculating life . he 's under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners , who lord it over him though it 's he who set up the practice . they 're white , by the way , and he 's black . there 's also the lascivious patient from hell , who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices , but starts looking different when charlie comes by and notices she 's a babe . his libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute . he 's also drawn to the breasts of liv tyler , a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat charlie when he admits he might need help . sandler 's mad scenes are a little too theatrical , as are a lot of the plot devices ( in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point ) , but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching . charlie 's not just delusional and sad , but dangerous and violent , and all these efforts to help him start to backfire . the movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people ca n't be made right . this is an interesting movie -- sometimes a touching one -- and it 's the first time 9/11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering . but there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times , many of the people are too broadly drawn , and the overly grand hollywood interiors have dreadful décor ; only the manhattan streets look real . there 's a courtroom scene that is preposterous , and donald sutherland is a judge who 's too good to be true . alan 's family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call . and yet this is worth watching for the acting -- the control and subtlety of cheadle , and sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in p.t . anderson 's 2002 punch-drunk love , though that 's clearly a better movie , in fact a much better one .
vonnegut 's words are best experienced on paper . the tales he weaves are gossemar , silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of marilyn manson or jerry bruckheimer explosions . his words have been treated well once before , in the remarkable slaughterhouse-5 . mother night is probably one of the three novels vonnegut has written i could take to a desert island , along with slaughterhouse-5 and bluebeard . the film version deserves a 10 , but the books are so permanently part of my interior landscape that i just ca n't do it ... some of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory ...
i recommend families if possible , to show this to older children only.some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle.now that thats out of the way , let me explain about this movie.this is in reality a documentary of a male fox , who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate.the beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score , is breath taking.you had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible , it 'll get ugly later.they gave both the fox and the vixen names , but i ca n't remember what they are for the likes of me.he fights off this invading male , to win her love.they later on create a den , and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs ; one of which is blind.there are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family , but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon.the first victim is the blind pup , who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away.the second victim is the mother , who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole.she unknowingly walks into a foot trap.while trying to escape she rips off part of her foot , causing her to bleed to death.the rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree.the male is now a single dad , forced to take on the roll of mom and dad.he alone has to teach them the skills they need for life.it later proves not to be enough , when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own ; thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man.i wo n't spoil the surprising ending for you , but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail.and it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through.i wanted to say that i saw this when it first came out in early 1980s , when we had a thing called showbiz cable.i was only 4 when i saw it , but i could never understand why they would n't let me see all of it.now i know why , after i secretly watched it when it came on disney , when i was 9.i felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on.i was moved to tears.but as dark and ugly as it was , it serves a purpose.to let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals , and why they are endangered.this documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species , and i hoped it worked.its not fake like the true life nature films by disney , they do n't teach about why animals are going extinct.the encroachment of land , the killing off of the foxes main prey , and senseless killing of these beautiful animals ; has resulted in them becoming endangered.i wish they would make sequel to this movie , ( glacier fox 2005 ) to see if they 're being treated better.maybe have it be about a vixen pup named teresa and her siblings growing up.this movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes , especially when one of the parents suddenly dies.the surviving parent takes on the roll of both , and tries to teach the important lessons of life.it is n't always enough to protect them when they 're adults , especially when some of their lives becomes ruined.or they fall victims to tragedy themselves.best all around soundtrack and musical score i 've ever heard .
the concept of having laurel & hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious . it guarantees some funny situations and silly antics , from especially stan laurel of course as usual . the movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula . it does n't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending . it 's still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless , so it works for the movie . the supporting cast of the movie is surprising good . sam adams is great as the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield goes deliciously over-the-top as the nutty professor . the movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences , which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed . it all helps to make `` dirty work '' to be one of the better laurel & hardy shorts . 8/10
since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed . this show was a 70s version of the poplular 90 's tv series `` x-files '' - but with a bit more of a comedic/light hearted approach . but do n't get me wrong , some of these episodes have full on horror themes , many in which have some pretty greuesome plots ( left to the imagination of course- this was the early 70s television ) . some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting , but that is the charm and attraction to this series . whether you like mystery crime dramas , comedies , or sci-fi/horror themes , this series brought all that together . each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so ( 1 hour with commercials ) and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more . a great classic show that is underrated in my book !
this is one of my all time favorites . it is so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy . i really like a film full of good quotes and this has it ... one of my favorites is when albert einstein says to ed walters `` are you thinking what i 'm thinking '' and ed says `` now what are the odds of that happening ! '' in my opinion , a film is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it , and with this one , you can ! ! i also really enjoyed walter m.s way of portraying einstein . i think all the characters fit together really well and the story flows nicely . there are so many times that i find myself smiling right along with the film and quoting my favorite lines as i watch it ! i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a feel-good romantic comedy now and then !
for those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls , think again . there is a totally different side to the japanese animation . yakitate ! japan is one of those shows . it is a sweet-natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread . his universe is all about creating a japanese bread that can match with the famous european breads . the show is as wacky as they come and i 'm sure that non-japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes . but it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show . in the world of yakitate ! it is not uncommon for people to look like they 've just had an orgasm after eating bread . the bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers , from time-traveling to swimming like a fish . that weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows i 've watched in a while .
this is easily a 9 . michel serrault , known more for comic roles in the earlier part of his acting career , does a stunning , even worryingly stunning job of impersonating dr petiot , a legendary french serial killer . he is just so believable at every and any moment in the film , that the actor completely disappears behind the character - only the very best ever achieve this feat , and when they do it is only in a handful of parts at best . the whole story ( a real story which happened in 20th century france ) is so powerful , so sinister - it makes for a very strong film that one remembers for a long , long time .
antwone fisher is the story of a young emotionally troubled u.s. navy seaman . his problems lead him to jerome davenport , a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his troubles stem from his childhood upbringing . get ready to shed a tear or two . the movie could thaw the coldest heart . i loved the story , which turns from something so very awful to happen to anyone into a positive ending . antwone fisher is a powerful movie , most importantly about forgiveness . other important issues that get you thinking are child abuse , adoption , and foster care . oscar winner , denzel washington does an impressive job in his directorial debut . there were many scenes which i enjoyed watching . they included the beginning ( dreams of a little boy  check out the gigantic-sized pancakes ! ) and the ending ( dreams turned into reality ) , which beautifully tied the story together . another wonderful scene occurred when the doctor encouraged antwone to search for his family to find answers to his questions about his family that abandoned him . my favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction towards him . priceless . all the actors represented their parts well . in addition to directorial responsibilities , mr. washington continues to show why he won an oscar award and is successful in all his acting roles . he had a strong presence in this movie . actor , derek luke demonstrated why he was so right for the part of antwone fisher . he portrayed very real and heart-tugging work . joy bryant who played the part of cheryl , antwone 's love interest , resembled a ray of sunshine on the screen . the chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters . novella nelson who played the part of mrs. tate , a despicable character , deserves special mention . although we only see her for a few minutes , the actress who played fisher 's mother gave an outstanding performance . everyone should see antwone fisher .
halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever ! john carpenter and debra hill created the most suspenseful , creepy , and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller . michael myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators , such as jason vorhees ( friday the 13th ) , the miner ( my bloody valentine ) , and charlie puckett ( the night brings charlie ) . okay , so i got a little obscure there , but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre . no longer did a monster have to come from king tut 's tomb or from dr. frankenstein 's lab . he could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia . and on the night he came home ... haddonfield , illinois and the viewers would never be the same . there are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies . first is the setting ... it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood . many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters . this is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe , but if trouble starts to brew , nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved ( especially when a heavy-breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine . ) along with the setting , the movie takes place on halloween ! ! the scariest night of the year ! while most people are carving jack-o-lanterns , michael myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers . besides the setting , there is some great acting . jamie lee curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine , laurie strode , a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date . however , it is donald pleasance , as dr. sam loomis , who really steals the show . his portrayal of the good doctor , who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of michael myers and feels compelled to send him to hell once and for all , is the stuff of horror legend . however , it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film . once you hear it , you will never forget it . i also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture . nowadays , they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie , giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of . in halloween , john carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at michael myers . he always seems like he is a part of the shadows , and , i think that is what makes him so terrifying . there are many scenes where michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens ( unbeknownst to them ) , which adds to his creepiness . if you think about , some wacko could be watching you right now and you would n't even know it . unfortunately for our teenagers ( and fortunately for us horror fans ) , when they find michael , he 's not looking for candy on this halloween night .. he 's looking for blood . finally , michael myers , himself , is a key element to this movie 's effectiveness . his relentless pursuit of laurie strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop . he is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life . so , if you have not seen this movie ( if there are still some of you out there who have n't , or even if you have ) , grab some popcorn , turn off every light , pop this into the old dvd and watch in fright . trick or treat !
when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores jud.this is not steven kings best work . i thought that his best work was the shining . i do n't think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking . as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick . i mean making the gage evil and how he kills jud is genius . making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool . people who did n't like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all . do n't expect something from a movie that it is n't . it still in a general area was n't that good . i still recommend people to watch the movie
this docu-drama is what you would expect from richard attenborough , the man who gave us `` gandhi '' : beautifully photographed , compellingly casted , well written in the measured , literate manner that hollywood discarded in the 30 's , and scrupulously accurate . it stands out as a genre film , excelling in its portrayal of native american ( or , more appropriately for its canadian setting , `` first nations '' ) culture and standing with `` black robe '' as a wonderfully photographed piece of canoe country and its culture ( here , circa 1934 ) . this idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject : archie `` grey owl '' belaney , a scot raised in hastings ( england ) by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the `` red indian '' tales of his childhood that he went to canada , disappeared into the woods , and became a trapper and adopted son of an ojibway band . he was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning indian brides , none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it , for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character . one of his wives ( one smarter than he , by most accounts ) propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the north , and this forms the focus of attenborough 's tale . the chemistry between brosnan and annie galipeau ( as grey owl 's wife pony ) is engaging and , if not firey , is nonetheless quite touching . a good film when you need some time from the madding crowd .
if you are a traveller , if there is a fire burning into your heart , if you 'd call `` home '' every place on earth , but none of them can give you enough , if you are always looking for the next thing and if you believe the other part of your soul is somewhere out there , see this movie and you 'll find out a little , but wonderful , piece of life sitting next to you .
'the rookie ' was a wonderful movie about the second chances life holds for us and also puts an emotional thought over the audience , making them realize that your dreams can come true . if you loved 'remember the titans ' , 'the rookie ' is the movie for you ! ! it 's the feel good movie of the year and it is the perfect movie for all ages . 'the rookie ' hits a major home run !
well , tenko is without doubt the best british television show ever , the performances , the directing , the casting , the suspense , the drama ..... everything is fantastic about it . although the show fell a little later in its final season , this ending movie picked up the threads nicely and wove a superb story for fans of the show and newbies . i can not recommend this movie more , find it and watch it . but i do advise watching the series first , as the first 2 seasons are even better than this fantastic movie . an obvious ( 10/10 )
`` father is still away on business '' was headline of an review after `` promise me this '' premiere in cannes . i do understand why many thinks the same but unique expression of kusturica is still present in his new movie and is something why critics ca n't touch him . i had two hours of pure energy without rest . even when kusturica is suffering of lack of concentration or fear of empty space he is still unique and unspoiled . surprisingly good performance of stribor kusturica . much more close-ups and less landscapes then in `` life is a miracle '' . marija petronijevic has femme fatal world class potential , please do n't spoil it . surely , i recommend to everyone to see this film .
i 'm so glad i happened to see this video at the store . i was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be a true gem . i loved that the movie , a love story of sorts , was n't about some beautiful twenty-somethings ; rather , it 's a story of some beautiful sixty-somethings , who used used to be twenty-somethings . it 's a good , well written , and wonderfully acted story with fabulous wwii band music thrown in as well . it 's also got a delightful surprise in it for scottish castle lovers . it left me smiling and ready to watch it again , which i did a couple more times before i turned it in . i highly recommend it .
good luck finding this film to even watch - it 's not yet released on tape or dvd . i saw on release in the early '70 's , was lucky enough to catch it via american cinematheque 's preservation efforts , and it still has some tangible moments that stayed with me for thirty years . no reason to repeat rwint 's accurate comments here . as a come-out director soon after the soaring success of five easy pieces , jack n has been said to have managed the low budget effort as best as possible , and it certainly shows in the wandering and meandering that could have used some re-cutting . but it 's also a memorable icon for it 's time : the all very intense clashes of late 60 's college sports , student movements , sexual revolution , and more . why see this film ? it was probably a ground breaker in some scenes : the frisky male bonding in the after-game showers ; karen black 's scene with tepper in the car will catch you a little off guard - but it 's the first use of a word i had n't witnessed in film before ; and the casual and unexpected use of nudity overall . there are probably others i 'm omitting . look for a nice surprise of a young cindy williams in one of her first films ; a thin david ogend stiers ; mike warren fresh out of his powder-blue ucla uniform and readying for a dark-blue tv uniform ; robert towne - actor ; and a whole lot of folks simply playing themselves . now : any connection between harry gittes last name , robert towne , and a certain character in chinatown and the two jakes ? it gets a `` 7 '' based on karen black . you 'll see why .
`` telefilms '' tend to fall under the pitfalls of a low budget and a hasty shooting schedule , which is why this film always tends to buck the trend . george c. scott embodies ebenezer scrooge perfectly , fully encompassing all of his cold tendencies , and still makes him a simpathetic character . the production value for this film was exceptional , never relying on boffo special effects or soundstage set-ups , yet relying on the depth and clarity of on-site shooting and strong backdrops . a movie that certainly stands alone .
i simply never tire of watching freebird . my husband was an extra so i was involved from the start . have kept in touch with jon and have helped out with promoting the film both in cinemas and now the dvd release . even to the extent of distributing promotional postcards on cross channel ferries and various places throughout france . freebird was expertly written and directed with the perfect combination of fun and serious moments plus choice casting . only phil daniels could fit the role of grouch . great privilege to meet jon and the cast at the party following the premier in january . anything else you want doing jon just ask , either email or phone , you know how to get me . sue xx
when a rich tycoon is killed in a plane crash , his spinster twin sister , martha craig ( madge kennedy ) , does n't believe he grabbed the controls in a suicide dive ( even though self-snuff runs in the family ) but his three beautiful daughters could n't care less . the pilot , jim norton ( john bromfield ) , goes to work for valerie craig ( kathleen hughes ) who soon coerces him into helping her wrest control of the estate from her troubled sister , lorna ( sara shane ) and the family lawyer ( jess barker ) . valerie wants norton to seduce lorna when he 's not fending off the advances of another sister , the nymphet vicki ( marla english ) , but her plans are thrown into a tailspin when norton falls for his prey . all bets are off as a world of woe -including corporate chicanery , seductions , suicides , blackmail , a murder plot , the mann act , double-crosses , disfigurement , and poetic justice- befall `` craig manor '' , an imposing mansion on a bluff overlooking the sea ... this preposterous potboiler would have made a perfect second feature for written on the wind , also from 1956 . douglas sirk 's saga of a powerful ( and powerfully dysfunctional ) oil clan was said to have inspired the 1980s night-time tv serial dallas but the craig 's low-brow excursion into insanity seems right out of it 's sinful sister-soap , dynasty . all three siblings ( only one of whom is really bad ) are great beauties but it 's kathleen hughes ' cartoon villainy that stands out . valerie is relentless in her quest to inherit the family fortune and her unbridled enthusiasm for evil is one of the movie 's many guilty pleasures . teenage sister vicki is quite a piece of work as well , reminiscent of carmen sternwood in the big sleep . when they first meet , she pulls the equivalent of trying to sit on norton 's lap while he 's still standing by coming on to him with the line `` i graduated summa cum laude from embrace-able u . '' whew ! three bad sisters , produced by schlockmeister howard w. koch , is a terrific trash-wallow in exploitation excess and the cast is b-movie heaven : marla `` she creature '' english , 50s hunk john `` revenge of the creature '' bromfield ( once married to french sexpot corinne calvet ) , universal starlet sara shane ( discovered by hedy lamarr ) , jess `` mr. susan hayward '' barker , kathleen `` it came from outer space '' hughes , and former silent screen star madge kennedy give it all they 've got -however much or little that is . future eurotrash star brett halsey ( trumpet of the apocalypse ) is seen briefly as one of vicki 's victims . b-movie rating : 10/10 marla ( and her body english ) made marvelous movies ! three bad sisters was recently seen on the big screen as part of the palm springs film noir festival but the jury 's still wiping soap suds out of ... aw hell , it 's noir ( 5/10 on the noirometer ) .
i just saw `` behind bedroom doors , '' and this was the first softcore flick with a solid story behind it that i 've seen in a while . we begin with two neighborly couples -- vivian and james fenway ( julia kruis and eric carrington ) , and lillian and gabe harris ( nicole sheridan and chris gustafson ) . vivian appears to be a housewife , james is a lawyer running for district attorney , lillian works in real estate , and gabe is a successful plastic surgeon . got all that ? now , let 's get into it . enter abby , played beautifully by porn star chelsea blue . she 's renting the house across the street from the fenways and lives all by herself . at the beginning of the movie , james looks out his window and sees abby engaged in playtime with her girlfriend , gigi ( played by prolific pornstress monique alexander ) and secretly begins to wonder what it would be like to be with her . the next day , abby gets acquainted with all four of them , and appears to be a nice woman who just happens to be living an alternative lifestyle . she makes a pass at vivian , who seems startled and says to her , `` oh ... i 'm ... not that way . '' everything seems okay ... until the plan gets set in motion first , abby shows up at gabe 's office , naked , asking gabe if she should get a boob job . this is where we get our quote of the movie : `` tell me about gabe . '' `` what do you want to know ? '' `` is gabe happily married ? '' `` i 'm married . '' `` there 's trouble ..... let me guess . your wife stays at home , and does everything you ask . but , she 's a good girl . '' `` yes . '' `` she 's not a bad girl ? '' `` no . '' `` does that door have a lock on it ? '' you know what happens next .... abby gets it on with gabe , right there in the exam room . after that , she puts on a little show in her window for james , who comes over and wastes no time in having sex with her . what james does n't know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flashing red eye is really a camera taping all the festivities ( it 's so obvious anyway ) . abby has sex with gabe again later , and this time gigi joins in to make it a three-way . now that abby has something on both men , she requests $ 100,000 from each in order to buy her silence . not only could she ruin james 's run for office , but she could destroy gabe 's practice . while gabe and james wrestle with their guilt , abby finds time to seduce lillian -- who `` experimented '' with women in college . that was a long time ago , but you would n't know that seeing her in action with abby -- she looked like an old pro . while gigi goes along with the plan , she 's seems jealous of all the sex her girlfriend is having . `` it 's only business , '' abby says . confessions and apologies are sure to follow , as is some startling info on abby 's true identity -- it seems she 's been doing the same thing to different men in many different places . gabe and james use this info to fight back against abby 's blackmail . now , on to the sex . the sex scenes were pretty good , and considering all the women involved in this film except for julia kruis have a lengthy porn background , i would n't have expected anything less . nicole sheridan 's four scenes were the best of the movie , with the three-way coming in a close second . monique alexander only got naked once , but she was a relatively minor character . julia kruis was a major character and got naked the same number of times . i suppose since she was surrounded by experienced hardcore pros , she did n't have to have as many sex scenes . to wrap up , `` behind bedroom doors '' had a great storyline , which enhanced the overall grade of the film . i consider it tapeworthy . women : a- ( nicole sheridan was good in this film -- better than her later offerings in fred olen ray 's comedies . at least she can do drama somewhat . chelsea blue was a scene stealer -- she was n't that bad as the antagonist . i 'd give her an a all by herself . julia kruis was her usual self . i wish monique alexander had more face time in this film , though . ) sex : b ( solid , very solid sex scenes . nicole sheridan 's performances were almost hardcore quality . chelsea blue looked good in her scenes , too . the two girl-girl offerings were n't scorching , but they did warm up the screen . ) story : b+ ( i liked the dialogue and the main storyline . chelsea blue 's performance was good for the genre , and i was impressed with nicole sheridan 's turn at drama . ) overall : b ( this was a nice softcore flick . i 'm glad i was able to watch this one , as i was pleasantly surprised . if chelsea blue ever wanted to do more of these , she 'd be welcome anytime . that goes for nicole sheridan , too -- even though she 's probably better at doing comedy . i do n't mind hardcore girls who can act doing softcore films . )
it was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all-star flick . i laughed through the entire picture , as did my entire family . the movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy -- the players were hysterical -- i 'll bet they had a good old time while making it . of course goldblum and dreyfuss were great -- and how about those everly sisters , each of the two falco 's , and the divine music throughout . rob reiner made a great laughing limo driver , and gabriel byrne a laughable neurotic . not to mention gregory hines , burt reynolds , the sleepy joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references . paul anka was his usual entertaining self , with the added attraction of running scared after byrne decided to make a duet of his `` my way '' welcome home to vick performance . i am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to frank sinatra and friends ; dreyfuss imitated him well . i am also of the opinion that no one , of any age , would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie -- it 's a joke -- not a terrifying `` gangsta '' film . the cars and clothing were impressive , as was the decorative , `` vic 's place . '' truly , i think of `` mad dog time '' as a musical comedy , less harmful than many cartoons , tv crime dramas , and talk shows . i would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment .
over her dead body was a nice little movie.it was decent and entertaining , while still being pretty funny.there were a few cliché 's , but i found most stuff fresh.at first i did n't think it was going to be good at all , when it started out.if you can get past the first 20 minutes though , the movie starts getting more interesting.this film was n't burst out in laughter hilarious , and was n't oh my gosh wonderful.it was just a movie that you can sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was.i do n't see how this movie was bad.it 's rating is just a bit too low.i could 've dealt with a 5.5 , but a 4.8 ? also , giving this movie a 1 is disgraceful.it was pretty good , and there was nothing horrible enough about it to give it a 1 , which is what most people gave it .
spoilers i loved the later episodes from college and on , but i wish i could get the last season on dvd . unfortunately , the latest i could get is the first college season . still the teenage years were sweet ; although they focused a lot on magic , they also made her into a character that teens could relate to , deeling with the stuggles of teens , and children in divorced families . this show was very innocent ; they did not get into the morbid teenage problems such as sex and drugs , but they did deel with pressure to fit in . i loved watching her grow up and cope with her magic on her own and trying to convince her aunts to let go as she left the nest . the older episodes were cute , but it was just so much better to see her as ( well not really a teenage witch anymore ) but an adult witch . i loved roxy and mortgan ; they were so talented ! in the earlier episodes the aunts were great actresses , but they were so strict , kind and loving , but they treated her like a young child in some ways , but not in every way . i mean they grounded her for every little mistake she made with her magic , i mean let her learn from her own mistakes for once ! that was what i liked about the college episodes ; she was able to learn from her own mistakes without be grounded over everything ; that was annoying . not to put down hilda and zelda . melissa joan hard is beautiful and was perfect for the sabrina with her perky personality . i liked the last episode where she ran off the marry harvey , but as somebody else said , it would have been nice to see what happened after . i mean i believe it was obvious they were getting married ; where else would they be running off to in her wedding dress ? but i would have liked to have seen it . i supposed they wanted to leave it up to the viewer to choose the ending though rather than spoon feeding it to us as most comedies do . somebody said they could have shown them marry and go to school in the house , but they already graduated college . sabrina had great job for a magazine and i think harvey had a good job , because he lived in a nice apartment that we only see at the end , but they never say what he does . as a child they always talk about how he does not want to be an exterminator like his dad . when sabrian moved into the house that season , they never really explain how it happened . actually , there is a lot the show does not explain , but i supposed it is supposed to be to leave it up to us and give it some mystery . prior to sabrina and her friends moving into the house , they show hilda getting married and this whole spell that ends up with zelda turning into a child . hilda comes back in the last episode ( and zelda is there in some other form , but beth is not on the episode ) but they do not show zelda 's husband or what happened , like did they have children ? maybe they did n't want too much going on in one episode . i also liked hart 's sister who played her spoiled cousin ! she was pretty and a great actress and it was interesting to see her grown up ! i cannon believe it has been six years since the show went off the air ! i still love the reruns ! also , i do n't know if anybody noticed this , but in the earlier episodes , the town was called westbridbe ( a made up town i believe , which was supposed to be close to salem ) but in the later episodes , they do n't mention the name of the town being caled westbridge and i think they call it boston , unless that is just where she worked . also , i wanted to add , i found the episode , `` wild wild sabrina '' where she is taught about the importance of rules , to be insulting . she was 18 and too old to be grounded ; i would have been insulted if my parents grounded me at 18 . and i think while an 18 year old might mess up how she did , they need to learn the consequences on their own . i think at 18 they know rules are important .
`` cinderella '' is a film about a young girl whose mother passed away and her father remarried . once her father died , cinderella 's stepmother became very mean to her and made her do all of the chores around the house , like cleaning up after her two evil stepsisters . one day the king sent out a message to all of the single women to attend the royal ball in honor of his son , to find a wife . of course , cinderella did n't get to go , but her stepsisters did . cinderella was very upset and thought that there was no way she could attend the royal ball , until her fairy godmother appeared . so she did some magic and made cinderella into a beautiful woman , but she had to be back by midnight because that is when the magic changes back . while at the royal ball , cinderella loses track of time and the clock strikes midnight , so she runs out of the palace and loses her glass slipper . then the king orders the duke to find the women who wore that slipper . the duke searched every house , but finally found the women who it belonged to , cinderella . clyde geronimi , wilfred jackson , and hamilton luske directed one of the best animated disney films in 1950 . this film is about a magical fairytale . in the beginning of the film cinderella was a servant to her own family and had nobody to love her , but with a little bit of magic her whole life changed around and finally found love . my favorite thing about `` cinderella '' is the music . when cinderella 's fairy godmother appeared doing her magic , she sang the song bibbidi bobbidi boo . when i was a child , it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house , so i will never forget it . i also loved the part when cinderella and the prince were singing the song so this is love while they were dancing because they realized that they are in love . overall this film was my favorite film when i was a little child because every little girl wants to live a fairy tale life .
have you seen the graduate ? it was hailed as the movie of its generation . but a river runs through it is the story about all generations . long before dustin hoffman 's character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern suburbia , norman maclean and his brother paul were facing the same crushing pressures of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world . but how could a place like post ww1 montana be a showcase for the american family , at a time when the wild west still was not completely gone ? just what has maclean tapped into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves ? as the movie opens , norman is an old man , flyfishing beside a rushing river , trying to understand the course his own life has taken . the movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness , against time 's current and back to when he was a boy . he and his younger brother paul were the sons of a presbyterian minister and devoted mother . the parents fit snugly into their roles . mom takes care of house and home . dad does the work of the lord . the boys ponder what they will be when they grow up . norm has it narrowed down to a boxer or a minister like his dad . given the choice , little paul would be the boxer , since he 's told his first choice of pro flyfisherman does n't even exist . the boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks , fight to see who is tougher and do the things brothers do , all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like flyfishing . they are at similar points in their lives before college . but when norm returns from his six years at dartmouth , things are very different . paul is at the top of his game . master flyfisherman . grad of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the bench . norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life , even as his father grills him about what he intends to do . you 're left feeling that at least to pops , god will call you to your life 's work . but you have to stay open and ready to receive it -- all your life . father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate god 's eternal words . `` listen , '' their father urges . it 's both zen and quakerly . pretty radical for a stoic clergyman . but with all the beauty and contemplation , and even though the macleans are truly a god-fearing , scripture-heeding household , how is it that rev . maclean 's family is unraveling ? paul is true perfection as he fishes the river , but he 's feeling the pull of gambling and boozing , while his family does n't know how to keep him from winding up where he seems to be headed . mom , dad and brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they ca n't seem to help . pauly just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm . but the junior brother is losing his grip . norman starts getting his life on track , finding love and career , but paul continues to slide . the family that loves him watches helplessly . mother , father , brother flounder in their own ways trying to help , but none very effectively . how can a family that loves each other so much be so ill-equipped to handle this ? how can someone be so artful and full of grace when out in god 's nature , yet be somehow unfit or unwilling to fit into the constructs of society that god 's peoples have made for themselves ? these are all questions norman will ponder his entire life . the eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him , yet keep their secrets . the movie is beautiful to watch . this is certainly god 's country , and filming it won an oscar . director robert redford plays with the story from the book and teases the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he 's presenting , and it works well . but do go back and read the book , too . you 'll see norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest -- and you 'll see the places where the storyteller 's very words gurgle and sing right off the page with an exuberance of a river running through it , leading into the unknown .
this movie is just great . if you have a chance to see it , then you should run to see it . even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932 , pacino does a great job playing as tony montana to get around . pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great . if you thought that pulp fiction was good with the swear words ( if you saw it ) then you should also see scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them . ( its quite sweet ) even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time , not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct , it is still easy to follow along , but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything . personally , i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze , it is really just that great . this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy ... `` so say good night to the bad guy ''
this movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the nagging questions that have cropped up in recent scholarship concerning the `` passion '' ( suffering and death of christ ) accounts in the new testament . ( what motivated judas if money was not the issue ? what could bring the sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day ? why did pilate waffle ? ) it is a movie for the serious , thinking christian : fans of `` the passion of the christ '' will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization . as for myself , i find the portrait painted here -- of the willingness of ordinary people to so blithely sacrifice common decency when their own self-interest is at stake -- far more realistic and deeply unsettling . ( the disinterested , `` just doing my job '' look on the face of the man who drives the first nail in christ 's wrist is as chilling as any moment in film . ) the film makes no claim to `` authenticity '' , but the settings and costuming invariably feel more `` right '' than many more highly acclaimed efforts . it is a slow film but , if you accept its self-imposed limits ( it is , after all , `` the death '' -- not the life -- '' of christ '' ) , ultimately a very rewarding one .
ok , so it 's not a masterpiece like the godfather , but it does n't have to be . the only purpose this movie has is to make the viewer laugh several times . if it can make the viewer laugh a bunch of times , it has accomplished its purpose . i laughed out loud and left with a smile . i feel like i got my money 's worth .
those who are not familiar with cassandra peterson 's alter-ego elvira , then this is a good place to start . `` elvira , mistress of the dark '' starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message . it seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will . anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in las vegas , she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money . unfortunately , the place she has to go is the town of fallwell , massachusetts . having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down , she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things : a house , a dog and a cookbook . the town residents have mixed reactions : the teens like her , the women hate her , and the men lust after her ( although trying to remain moral pillars of the community ) . her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle vincent ( w. morgan sheppard ) , because he wants her cookbook . seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock . the film is actually pretty funny , with peterson a.k.a . elvira using her `` endowments '' and sexiness as a joke ( `` and do n't forget , tomorrow we 're showing the head with two things ... i mean the thing with two heads '' ) . especially funny as edie mcclurg as chastity pariah , the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line , but ends up looking ridiculous ( the picnic scene is the perfect example ) . deserves a peek ( the film , not her boobs , of course ) .
an axellent second installment that manages to be just as good as the first . once again , the casting is just wonderful . i like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and cleverness . the second episode is just very funny , very silly and very enjoyable . it is the very first christmas episode , about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as santa after having killed her own husband . just like the first episode ; karma . the most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call , first faking her fear until it becomes real .
in her autobiography , laureen bacall reveals that bogie told her that she should not make such dud movies as this one or something like that.at the time , douglas sirk was labeled `` weepies for women '' , actually , he was restored to favor , at least in europa , after he stopped directing.and when he filmed `` written on the wind '' , sirk had only three movies to make : '' tarnished angels '' , '' a time to love and a time to die '' , his masterpiece , imho , and finally '' imitation of life '' ( 1960 ) .then there was silence . actually bacall and hudson characters do not interest sirk.they are too straight , too virtuous.dorothy malone -who was some kind of substitute for his former german star zarah leander-and her brother robert stack provide the main interest of the plot.a plot constructed continuously , most of the movie being a long flashback.the instability of the brother and the sister , from a family of rich texan oil owners , is brought to the fore by garish clothes , and rutilant cars that go at top speed in a derricks landscape . malone 's metamorphosis at the end of the movie is stunning : suit and chignon , toying with a small derrick : she 's ready for life , the rebel is tamed . now alone , because she 's lost hudson ( but anyway , he was not in love with her ) .this end is a bit reactionary , but melodrama is par excellence reactionary ; three years later , in `` imitation of life '' , sarah-jane ( susan kohner ) will be blamed because she does not know her place .
i only saw iphigenia once , almost 30 years ago , but it has haunted me since . one sequence particularly stays in mind , and could only have been fashioned by a great director , as michael cacoyanis undoubtedly is . the context : the weight of history and a mighty army and fleet all lie on king agamemnon 's shoulders . an act of sacrilege has becalmed the seas , endangering his great expedition to troy . he is told he must sacrifice his daughter iphigenia to apollo in order to gain the winds for the sails of the thousand ships . he initially resists , but comes around , and tricks his wife clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the greek camp in order to marry the greatest of all warriors , achilles . clytemnestra and iphigenia arrive , find out about the sacrifice , and rage to the gods for protection and vengeance . meanwhile , the proud achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent , dishonorable way . he climbs a hill to tell iphigenia that he will protect her . the shot : the camera circles the two young people , without looking directly at each other . they bemoan their fate , and the weakness of men that deceive their loved ones and lust for war . suddenly , they gaze at each other and , for one moment , we feel both their power and beauty , and the unstated -- except by the camera -- irony that in another time , another place , they perhaps could love each other and be married . it is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant . what direction ! what camera ! what storytelling !
i 'd love to give this movie a 10/10 , but in its existing state i can only go to 8/10 tops . the post-code editing ( read : destroying ) of this film warrants a 2-point demerit . from my very limited knowledge of film history , baby face was apparently one of two movies that finally broke the camel 's back and brought the full wrath and enforcement of the production code into play in 1934 . ( i do n't know what the other movie was . ) as a result , the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be re-released after 1934 . it was chopped and edited to bits , and no original version is known to exist today . the best that we can see today is the version that tcm ( turner classic movies ) shows , but that is blatantly edited in several scenes , and has a really disappointing `` happy ending '' slapped onto the end . all the above being said , the movie is still pretty darned great and lots of fun to watch . barbara stanwyck is , as always , absolutely amazing and wonderful . she is so beautiful and powerful ; she just owns the whole movie ! she plays a woman who 's been used by men her entire life , starting with her father who pimps her out to the local erie , pa steel workers as well as to local politicians in a quid pro quo of 'if you do n't shut down my speakeasy i 'll let you sleep with my daughter ' . when the father dies in a fiery explosion near the beginning of the flick , the smile on stanwyck 's face is priceless . after the fire , stanwyck leaves erie with her maid and heads to new york city . she sets her sights on a skyscraper and starts literally working her way to the top . starting out with the personnel clerk in the hr department , she sleeps with him to get an entry level position at the bank . from there , she sleeps with man after man after man ( including a very young john wayne ) using each new man to help her land a higher paying job on a higher floor of the skyscraper , with increasingly powerful male bosses cum sugar daddies . stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to the top . it is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly fancier clothes and apartments as stanwyck works her way up the corporate ladder . stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale , manipulating , she-vixen in this flick ! if you watch this movie , i recommend stopping when you see the george brent character ( courtland trenholm ) die in stanwyck 's arms . skip the remaining 3 minutes or so ! the `` happy ending '' slapped on to the end of the movie for post-code audiences is insulting to the audience 's intelligence and lame beyond belief : the bank board members are sitting around a table expositing about mr. and mrs. trenholm 's million dollar donation to the bank and how they are living happily but poor in erie , with former vp trenholm now working in the steel mills - cut to the exact same footage of a steel plant that we saw in the beginning of the movie - `` the end '' . puh-leeze - how lame ! the movie originally ended with george brent succeeding in his suicide attempt . i think that ending fits the overall mood of the movie much better than the slapped on post-code ending . i certainly hope that a print of the original pre-code version of this flick is discovered during my lifetime ( update : the original has been found and should be out on dvd and/or tcm in 2006 ! ) . until then , i 'll enjoy the tcm version and switch it off before the lame-o post-code ending .
except for an awkward scene , this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along . except for one of the robert deniro scenes that does n't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie , this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done . in the updated tradition of the princess bride this contemporary presentation of magic and love is captivating . eight out of ten stars .
this was a great romantic comedy ! historically inaccurate ( einstein had no nieces or nephews as noted elsewhere in imdb ) but he made a great matchmaker . he brought together two very nice people played by two of the best actors working . the supporting cast ( lou jacobi , joseph maher , gene saks , stephen fry , etc . ) all clicked on screen and made this a great viewing experience . the fact he drove a car to get around seems to contradict all those images and posters of him riding a bicycle to get around . and did he wear socks in one scene ... reportedly , the professor never wore socks ! ( two new entries for the imdb goofs section . ) historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside , this was a great movie to watch with a great cast . i give it an 8 !
clint eastwood reprises his role as dirty harry who this time is on the case of a vigilante ( sondra locke ) who is killing the people that raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago . eastwood makes the role his and the movie is mainly more action then talk , not that i 'm complaining . sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment .
the last of the blond bombshells is an entertaining bit of fluff . judy dench plays elizabeth , a newly widowed woman at loose ends . she has spent most of her life being the dutiful wife and mother but has never been truly happy . shortly after her husband 's funeral , elizabeth is having her regular lunch date with her stick-in-the-mud children when she spots a street performer . this sparks memories of when she was a member of an all girl swing band in london during world war ii . we soon learn that the band was not exactly all girl as the drummer was a man dressing as a woman ala some like it hot . elizabeth pulls out her sax ( which she has been secretly practicing throughout her marriage ) and joins forces with the guitar-playing street musician . elizabeth is far more talented than the guitarist , and the money begins to flow in . she does n't take any money as she is wealthy and does n't need it . her playing is strictly for artistic fulfillment . elizabeth is seen one day by patrick ( ian holm ) who was the drummer-in-drag of the band . it seems that patrick was - and still is - quite the ladies ' man , and elizabeth - being only fifteen at the time - was the only band member who did not experience patrick 's `` talents '' other than drumming . elizabeth is inspired by her granddaughter to get the old group together once again to play for the granddaughter 's school dance . thus begins a delightful trip down memory lane combined with aspects of a humorous road trip movie - all topped off with some really good swing and blues . i guess i 'm at the age in which i really enjoy older actresses doing their stuff , and this film is a treasure trove as it not only stars judi dench , but she is supported by none less than olympia dukakis , leslie caron , and a host of seasoned british character actresses . this is all topped off by the extraordinary voice of cleo laine . yes , it is fluff , but totally delightful and exceedingly entertaining fluff .
i saw this movie when mystery science theater ran it in 1993 . it is the worst thing i 've ever seen . so bad in fact , that by sheer freakiness , this movie must get a ten rating because it has to be seen to be believed . whoever wrote this script with children in mind should be beaten . i mean , really , the devil vs. santa ? visions of hell ? creepy laughing wind-up reindeer ? forced child labor with racial stereotypes ? it ai n't sesame street , that 's for sure.as crow exclaims during the mst3k showing , `` this is good ol ' fashioned nightmare fuel ! '' there 's plenty of weird innuendo and screwed up theology . merlin ( presumably the arthurian merlin ) hangs out with santa in his crazy castle in the clouds ( i.e . heaven ) . santa talks about baby jesus and sends letters to `` mr. stork '' for children who ask for siblings . there are symbols around the castle that either look like pentagrams or raf stars . my best friend and i have watch it every year since 1993 and we subject anybody we can hold down for 2 hours to watch it with us .
this was a highly original decent movie , and a brave move for all those involved . i do n't care if it 's not the most well put-together movie of all time , the fact that it has eddie murphy doing something non-formulaic , and that i do n't know what will happen next , makes it a favorite of mine . i wish more movies were as imaginative as this one , rather than the same old formula for entertainment .
i hated the first episode of this show ( 'protesting hippies ' ) so much in 1999 that i shunned the rest . however , when it came on 'the paramount comedy channel ' i watched it in full and , to my surprise , found it absolutely hilarious ( motto : never judge a comedy series in its first week ) ! set in 1969 , 'hippies ' stars simon pegg as 'ray purbbs ' , editor of an 'oz'-like underground magazine called 'mouth ' . his friends are the feminist jill , laid-back alex , and the half-wit hugo . back in the late '60 's , there was a feeling of incredible optimism amongst the young , that they could change the world through the printing of magazines nobody read . rather than sneering at the hippies ' naivety , 'hippies ' is affectionate towards it . arthur mathews ' scripts cheekily parody a number of that era 's icons - 'hair ' , 'woodstock ' , 'the graduate ' , even the infamous 'oz ' obscenity trial of the early '70 's . excellent performances from the cast ; julian rhind-tutt 's 'alex ' strangely put me in mind of the richard o'sullivan character from 'man about the house ' . its a shame that there was never a second series , possibly because of people like me . if you missed 'hippies ' , give it a try . once you get past the dire opener , you 're in for a treat !
i just saw this movie the other day when i rented it , and i thought this was going to be just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point , but diane joined boxing because she wanted to . i thought this movie was good . i gave it a 8/10 . that 's how good it is . plus a movie with michelle rodriguez is always good . even is she 's been in only six .
i would reccomend this film to everyone . not only to the fans of the rocker luciano ligabue , but to all film-buffs . because it 's sincere , moving , funny and true . because ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover , and every frame of his film is made with love and care . because his characters are loved and ask to be loved . because most of the italian debut films are lousy and this one , done by an outsider , is a real joy to watch and to listen at . because stefano accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of andrea pazienza , who was , like freccia , beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin , that ligabue shows as it is , unglamorous and ugly , without indulging in easy moralisms . because it 's a film that speaks to our heart , our ears , our souls . and because i lived the experience of the fm radios and it was exactly like that . thanks , luciano !
since my third or fourth viewing some time ago , i 've abstained from la maman et la putain while i wait for the dvd . in the meantime , i 've read the french screenplay as well as alain philippon 's monograph on jean eustache . the latter ends with a frustrating filmography , eleven films , fiction , doc , and in-between , impossible to see or , in the cases of mes petites amoureuses and le père noël ... , re-see . a few questions that hit me this moment : polish véronika 's french is plenty colloquial ( un maximum d ' `` un maximum d ' '' ) . even so , does she have an accent ? i think i can tell she does . what does the absence of color add , especially at the single spot the fringe of the city is glimpsed ? how does this fringe differ from the sleep and journey that separates worlds of the tempest and the winter 's tale ? ditto alphaville . we may imagine the elapsed years since have done it , but does eustache deliberately circumscribe the film 's milieu ? is this an enchanted isle ? is alexandre 's a fairy tale ? alexandre 's always choreographing himself , worrying about how or where to stand or walk , what to say when , announcing these decisions to who have to care less than he does what he does . or is this his way of trying to choreograph others by doing it to himself ? how different is he from vertigo 's scottie ? ( i say , i think , very . ) what 's the difference , and is there one , between eustache 's léaud , and truffaut 's , and godard 's ? how different is the present léaud ? is n't he still doing it , whatever it is , in recent roles , irma vep , le pornographe , whatever , approaching old age ? once i arrived early for one in a series of mostly antoine doinel ( léaud 's character ) truffaut films . for a long while , every three or five minutes , down the aisle would come a twenty-something male in scarf , tweedy coat , léaud hair , with a direction-seeking nose . i have no idea whether this was conscious or unconscious mimicry . i was that age , but have no idea what i myself looked like then . no scarf , at least . i do have a brother , though , who seems to have learned his carriage from bresson .
war , inc. ( 2008 ) * * 1/2 john cusack , marisa tomei , hilary duff , joan cusack , ben kingsley , dan aykroyd , sergej trifunovic , lyubomir neikov , ned bellamy , ( voice of : montel williams ) a hit-and-miss-21st century `` strangelove '' john cusack  who co-wrote the script with mark leyner and jeremy pikser  stars as a jaded hit-man named brand hauser who is burnt out but decides to follow thru on one final assignment by icing a middle-eastern oil minister named omar sharif ( yes , not that omar sharif but you get the tone here from this misfire for a laugh ) commandeered by the ex-vice president of the usa ( aykroyd , cusack 's old `` grosse pointe blank '' co-hort , doing a mean dick cheney manqué turn here ) , enlisting brand to do the deed under the guise of a trade show producer in mythical turaqistan ( read : iraq/afghanistan ) for the american private corporation tamerlane ( read : halliburton ) . while being briefed brand is faced with a moment of clarity when he comes across intrepid journalist natalie hegalhuzen ( tomei ) and eventually falls in love with her . meanwhile tamerlane is sponsoring the unlikely union of eastern european teen sensation yonica babyyeah ( a surprisingly decent duff aping her own celebrity with tongue- through-cheek ) and the idiot son of the country 's leader . what follows is a bold attempt for a 21st century black comedy a la `` dr. strangelove '' but for all intense and purposes there are sadly more misses than hits in this broad try for laughs amidst political message ( an unjust war being outsourced by american capitalism , check ! ) while cusack riffs on his martin blank from the aforementioned `` pointe '' he does add some nice touches of his man in black ( he does shots of tabasco sauce to take the edge off ) , the rest of the cast plays catch up ( except sister joan who is a riot as the high-strung aide- de-camp for hauser and has one of the film 's funniest laugh-out lines : `` my mass communications skills are finally paying off '' ) for the most part . cusack visited the iraq war earlier this year in the 180 degree different `` grace is gone '' and here he allows his political views wear on his sleeve ; while admirable overall the film 's pace and rhythms are off largely no-thanks to first time filmmaker joshua seftel making his directorial debut here ( and it is noticeable ) except for maybe the well-choreographed fight hauser is involved with babyyeah 's idiotic fiancé 's entourage . a nice attempt yet a misguided failure ; maybe next time cusack wo n't try so hard and let the idiocy of war speak for itself instead of doing the heavy lifting by himself .
europa ( zentropa ) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago . this film is truly unique , and a work of genius . the camerawork and the editing are brilliant , and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film , creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience . the participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed . max von sydow provides his great voice as the narrator . a one of a kind movie ! four stars ( highest rating ) .
some years ago , satellite channel u.k. gold promoted repeats of 'men behaving badly ' with the hype : `` here it is , the original flat-sharing sitcom ! '' . this was in fact untrue . 'man about the house ' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and ran from 1973-76 . it was the brainchild of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke , creators of the popular sitcom 'father dear father ' . when it ended , they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times . in the first episode , chrissy ( paula wilcox ) and jo ( sally thomsett ) are tidying their myddleton terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath . he is robin tripp ( richard o'sullivan ) , a southampton cookery student of no fixed abode . while his clothes dry out , he puts on a ladies ' dressing gown and prepares them a meal . they are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay . but there must be no naughty business . so robin has to pretend to be gay ... on b.b.c.-2 's ' i love 1973 ' , shown in 2000 , julie burchill claimed that 'house ' showed her a way of life she envied . she was not alone . one of the most iconic ( for me , anyway ) images of '70 's british television was sally thomsett coming out of the london underground carrying a parasol , and a 'blind ' man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past . a man living with two girls was a risqué subject for the time , but mrs.mary whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar , it was innocent , good-natured fun . mortimer and cooke 's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it . richard o'sullivan was still playing 'bingham ' in i.t.v . 's 'doctor in charge ' when this got started . in fact the second run of 'in charge ' overlapped with the first of 'house ' . he was born to play the sex-mad robin . paula wilcox 's 'chrissy ' was more streetwise than 'beryl ' , her character she played in 'the lovers ' , while sally thomsett 's 'jo ' was a lovable dizzy blonde . as time wore on , he became almost like an older brother to them . for many viewers , brian murphy and yootha joyce stole the show as the warring ropers . george had lost interest in sex , but mildred had not . they went on to their own show - the aptly titled 'george & mildred ' . the late doug fisher was good value as as robin 's wideboy friend larry . he worked so well he was made into a regular . within a year of its debut , there was the inevitable movie spin-off . i am not a big fan of the 'man about the house ' movie because i think it was stretched to fit the big screen . most of its characters had never appeared in the series . the format was sold to america , where it became the long-running 'three 's company ' starring the late john ritter and suzanne somers . it was far more suggestive than the british original , with somers often seen in sexy clothing . after six seasons , 'house ' ended with chrissy marrying robin 's older brother norman ( norman eshley ) . fans were devastated to see robin failing to get the girl he loved , but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show - 'robin 's nest ' .
i.q. , in my opinion , is a sweet , charming , and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you . if you ask me , james ( stephen fry ) really was a dull guy . to me , ed ( tim robbins ) was more suited for catherine ( meg ryan ) than james was . anyway , everyone involved in this film did an absolutely outstanding job . now , in conclusion , i highly recommend this sweet , charming , and hilarious romantic comedy about finding the right person for you to any tim robbins or meg ryan fan who has n't seen it . you 're in for lots of laughter , so go to the video store , rent it or buy it , kick back with a friend , and watch it .
out of the first five episodes of hammer 's short-running `` hammer house of horror '' series , this fifth episode with the wonderful title `` the house that bled to death '' is arguably the creepiest one . as a great fan of the hammer studios ' gothic horror films for many years , i wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently . so far , i 've only seen the first five episodes , and i have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come , but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are , i will be satisfied . whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor , this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine horror . the episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations . years later , william ( nicholas ball ) and emma peters ( rachel davies ) move in the house with their little daughter sophie ( emma ridley ) . soon after moving in , however , the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house , which is seemingly haunted ... the second episode directed by francis megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry , `` growing pains '' ( episode 4 ) , and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances . the film is also well-made in terms of effects , cinematography and score . `` the house that bled to death '' is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow hammer-fans should like to see in a short horror tale . the film delivers a creepy atmosphere , genuine scare moments and intelligent twists , and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end . overall , this is highly recommendable to hammer fans .
robert altman is my favorite american director . i must admit that i have enjoyed the films that are usually scorned : `` quintet '' , if only for giving me the pleasure of seeing a grown-up and beautiful brigitte fossey , who was unforgettable as the little girl in `` forbidden games '' ; `` health '' , for having lauren bacall , carol burnett , alfre woodard and glenda jackson , all in the same cast ; `` popeye '' , for that splendid and surreal world , shelley duvall 's olive oyl and the wonderful malta locations ; `` o.c . & stiggs '' , for its proposal of an anti- '' adolescents flick '' ; `` beyond therapy '' , for all its lunacy and for the presence of genèvieve page , who for all her effort to look parisian chic is taken for a travestite ... i have even enjoyed his one-act tv movies , like `` the dumb waiter '' and `` the laundromat '' . when there is not much plot to develop in his films , you have wonderful performances , from burnett , john travolta , kim basinger or jane curtin . i perceive and enjoy the different approach and description he makes of the many different cultures of the united states . it is a pity that his genius is seldom appreciated , and that he is always forgotten when the time comes for giving out american prizes and awards . he is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies . he is more of a maverick . so it is not surprising for me to find so many bad comments posted here about `` the gingerbread man '' , his most 'mainstream ' effort to date and to my knowledge . i did not know there were so many people who thought like leonard maltin , who does not like altman at all . in this case , one may dislike `` the gingerbread man '' , but for me the reason has more to do with grisham than with the director-screenwriter . some of altman 's trademarks are here : improvised dialogue , great performances , a funny lawyers ' office with typical irreverent receptionist and secretary . while some people find it boring , i found the first act fascinating , thanks also for the great cinematography by changwei gu , the man who shot `` red sorghum '' , `` ju dou '' and `` farewell my concubine '' . he has a way of showing us the same things we see in other american movies , but under a different light . through his `` foreigner 's gaze '' , almost everything seems new and different . in this first act , things were so logical and true ! wait until you get older . you may get in trouble if you fall under the spell of someone younger and beautiful as embeth davidtz . i know for myself what i have done fascinated by someone who is younger than i am ! then you have robert duvall 's repellent , menacing and mysterious character , while that geraldo storm is threatening savannah . the second act gets a little phony and even funny , because altman may have conducted it with a grin . i remember laughing aloud in several instances with his ironic remarks . i think he was applying a bit of brecht , distancing us , preparing us for the third act , which is plain hollywood pastiche . altman does it with expertise . being a wise man , and an intelligent director , luckily he did not fall into the traps of today 's action movies . he was directing a tale of lust , greed and death . i was not disappointed a bit with the movie . if i give it a nine instead of 10 , it is because of grisham . the american reader has turned him into a best-selling author . so why complain ? maybe we should thank altman for showing us the seams in his stories , the dullness , the flatness and the silliness of them all . however , he does it with so much gusto and humor , that i can not but disagree with the negative comments . for me , these persons saw another movie ... and vice versa .
the 1986 tv movie of the spirit was a pilot for a possible series . however , spirit creator will eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced . i thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit ( sorry ) of the comic with a modern twist . i 'm sorry it did n't materialize into a series . sam ( flash gordon ) jones was a perfect spirit . nana visitor was a nice ellen dolan and of course would later go on to star trek : deep space nine years later . maybe with the release of frank miller 's big-screen version of the spirit , more people will be able to see this rare gem of spirit history . it seems that when hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea , someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars . when antonio banderas donned the mask of zorro , we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on dvd , such as the great alain delon version of the 1970s ( although all copies i ever saw were badly edited ) . heres hoping someone will release the tv adventure of the spirit to dvd soon .
lindy ( meryl streep ) and her husband michael ( sam neill ) have just welcomed a baby girl , azaria . as seventh day adventists , they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church , with their two older boys looking on . michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayer 's rock , one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia . not being wealthy , the family camps near the site . after a wonderful first day , lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents . suddenly , she hears azaria crying . as lindy rushes to the tent , a dingo dog is just exiting , shaking his head . the baby is gone and soon , so is the dingo . although the entire camp looks for the baby , she is not found . concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child , the chamberlains struggle to accept god 's decision and go on with their lives . but , unfortunately , the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby . she is subsequently arrested and put on trial . how could this happen ? this is a great depiction of real events that shows how `` mob rule '' is not a figment of the imagination . the entire country turns against the chamberlains , in part because they are seen as odd . streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy , whose own strong-willed demeanor works against her every step of the way . neill , likewise , does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael . the cast is one of the largest ever , with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindy 's case . the costumes , scenery , script , direction and production are all top of the line . if you have never seen or heard of this film , remedy that straight away . it is not a far cry from reality to say that this `` cry '' should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media .

samuel fuller 's pickup on south street is anomalous : a `` red scare '' movie devoid of hysteria , in which the communist threat is nothing more than the mcguffin that ignites the plot . pickpocket richard widmark relieves loose woman jean peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm ; unbeknownst to either of them , it harbors secrets vital to the cold war . peters , as it happens , was under surveillance by fbi agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who 's running her , cowardly comsymp richard kiley . in trying to retrieve the precious film , both sides enlist the help of thelma ritter , a streetwise old jane who 's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears . fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story , which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality . from the subways to the waterfront , his midsummer manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that 's almost pungent . the love scenes between peters and widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender , and they 're scored to `` again , '' a song introduced by ida lupino in road house , also starring widmark . the pace slackens for ritter 's beautifully written and played death scene -- among the most poignant vignettes in all noir , and a kind of mirage-oasis in a film parched of sentimentality . this is writer/director fuller 's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle ; his later explorations of american pathology ( the crimson kimono , the naked kiss , underworld u.s.a. ) never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as pickup on south street .
now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i 'm appalled . for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i 'm afraid i do n't know what the world has come to . let me tell u something . i started watching many t.v shows like lost , prison break , dexter , deadwood and even invasion . but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season , especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season . then we have the sopranos . i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season , and more importantly all of its episodes . there is no department that this show does n't excel in . acting- nothing short of superb . james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode , after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would 've been the better choice , however after watching the first few episodes , i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony . the raw emotion he displays is superb . then we have everyone else , edie falco , michael imperioli , lorraine bracco , dominic chianese ( whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part 2 ) and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie 'walnuts ' gualtieri and silvio dante . all of these actors perform to the best quality , and all giving an excellent performance in each episode . then we have the story , never have i been so sucked into a t.v show before . the story is nothing short of excellent . each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic . i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of . its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence , but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television , and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show . not just say its too violent , or they feel that the character of tony is immoral , i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day , i do n't think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god . i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me , you 'll be hooked from the very first episode , i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show , hooked on it . trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t.v . after you 've watched the first season , you 'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television , and no t.v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos .
this movie is more lupin then most , especially coming from funimation . other then the bad dub , it is n't bad . the first hour is a lot like the comic ( which is what all lupin the 3rd stuff is based on ) . lupin 's trying to get a huge treasure . fujiko 's using lupin 's weakness to women to try to get something out of it . the last bit is n't that bad , he 's with another women , but of course fujiko 's still him number one . a lot of the other lupin movies are more family with cuss words then lupin . any good lupin fan i think will be pleasantly surprised ( i know i was after hearing so many bad things about this movie ) . it might be a bit better without the little animations rolling during the credits ( they make it a little mushy ) but overall , it is n't a bad film . good enough to be one of the few i 'd watch again of the lupin iii movies .
in the immortal `` shaun of the dead '' , we are introduced to a london where the slackers and the high-and-mighty alike are forced to battle flesh-eating , reanimated corpse versions of their friends and family . at the end of the film , it is suggested that the zombies are rendered harmless and used as cheap labour . `` fido '' presents us with an epilogue to `` shaun '' set in 1950 's america , in a hilariously witty and original `` what-if ... ? '' movie . the film is set post-zombie-apocalypse , for a change ; after the terrors of the zombie wars , ended by the creation of the zomcon company and their patented zombie collars which make the corpses as docile as lambs . every town in the world is fenced off from the wild zone , the once-fertile landscape torn asunder by the surviving zombies and left-overs from the apocalyptic wars . the idyllic town of willard is your typical , pristine 50 's suburbia , with one small difference ; social status is measured by a family 's amount of domesticated zombies . unfortunately , the robinson family has no zombies whatsoever , due to their patriarch , bill 's , fear of the reanimated dead . timmy robinson and his mother helen both suffer from the pressures of suburban life , until the day that helen purchases a zombie servant in a desperate attempt to impress the neighbours . the zombie earns timmy 's love when he rescues him from a pair of violent bullies , and the two form a bond to rival the classic `` boy-and-his-dog '' cliché ... a boy and his zombie . timmy names his `` pet '' fido , and he soon becomes an aid for both timmy and helen to escape the prison-like routine bill has put them in . but when fido 's domestication collar goes on the fritz and he devours the elderly mrs henderson , the robinsons have to contain their connection the sudden wild zombie epidemic and still manage to keep their beloved fido . a film whose sharp wit and satirical gore carry it just as much as its all-star cast ( including `` the matrix '' 's carrie-anne moss as helen robinson and billy connelly as fido ) , `` fido '' is a zom-com for the ages . with some rather twisted subplots - for example , the sweet and unsettling feelings that helen and fido begin to have for each other - and a poignant commentary on 50 's suburbia and the zombie genre , the film manages to bring out the worst ( and the best ) in its characters while still enabling you to care for them . `` fido '' is , by far , one of the best dark comedies i 've ever seen , one of the best films that i 've seen in a long time , and the best zom-com since the incredible `` shaun of the dead '' .
val kilmer and dylan mcdermott are terrific . i have seen kilmer on the doors , however his interpretation of john holmes is superb . nothing compared to boogie nights which was kind of slow . wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around . at the same time , the john holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed . the movie deserves being watched more than once . the seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing .
i 'm disappointed that reiser ( who wrote the film ) felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever . maybe that 's his idea of `` adult '' films , plenty of nasty words with bathroom humor thrown in ? i thought better of him and think less of him for this movie . falk 's acting and some moments of humor as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating . this might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their foibles . but the lack of consideration for audience families seriously detriments what could have been a family film but fails . certainly not worth spending money on , though it might be worth a watch for free on television .
home room really surprised me . in comparison to other movies that were written regarding columbine high school this one is the best . home room does not show the school shooting but rather the aftermath and the effects of the community and the town . the movie focus ' on two opposite characters. , alecia ( busy phillips ) and deanna ( erika christensen ) . alecia is an outcast who witnessed the entire shooting . she seems to show no emotion about it . deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim . alecia is forced to visit deanna at the hospital in order to graduate . meanwhile the police are investigating alecia as she might have known the shooting was going to happen . alecia and deanna are very different and do not get along at first . eventually they develop a mutual understanding for one another and become friends . ( very much in the style of the breakfast club ) . home room beautifully shows the power of closeness and turmoil after a school shooting . i would recommend this film to anyone and everyone .
hollow point , though clumsy in places , manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie . the primary entertainment value here is humor - everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy . oh , by the way , advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie ...
just watched the film for the 3rd time and enjoyed lindsay crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before . it just keeps getting better and better . you simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech , the slow deliberate action , everything being exactly in place . truly one of the great ones and definitely my all-time favourite ! ! !
hi i 'm from taft california and i like this movie because it shows how us little town people love our sports football is the main thing in taft and this movie shows just how important it is i personally think they should make another one but instead of actors use us kids to play the games well show you our determination we 've beat bakersfield every game for the past 6 years and since i 'm a senior next year its my last chance and then its college we 've had running backs lead the state and i 'm next if you want to know me i 'm kyle taylor and i average seven to eight yards a carry and about five times a game ill break away on a 75 or around that yard run so check us out at our website and go to our sports page bye
stan & ollie become saps at sea when their wayward little boat is commandeered by a vicious murderer . the boys are wonderful in this feature , which starts out with one of their most hilarious set pieces , the horn factory . always a few steps out of sync with the rest of creation , laurel & hardy inhabit a world where icy radios & bedded billy goats are the rule , not the exception . with its brief length , the film is more in style with their classic short subjects , which explains its episodic nature . only the boys get screen credit , but movie mavens will recognize other familiar faces : james finlayson appears as a loony doctor , richard cramer does full justice to his bad guy role , sweet mary gordon plays the boys ' perplexed neighbor . that 's charlie hall as the apartment house desk clerk and silent screen comic ben turpin portrays a most peculiar plumber . one of the film 's script writers was silent comedian harry langdon . stan & ollie are the main focus , however . watching hardy go berserk at the sound of a horn , or laurel 's antics with bananas , for instance , reminds the viewer why these fellows remain absolute cinematic giants .
this shorter movie is the epitome the expected results when the imbecile runs the asylum . it is sad how the futures of these young people were rolled down a craps table when neither saddam hussein nor the people of iraq , god rest the souls of the 350,000 plus that have been killed , had anything to do with terrorism nor al-quida . following this movie the astute viewer will need to pick up or download a copy of `` loose change . '' this movie is available free on the internet , until the bush cabal locks it down , by googling-up the very title , as indicated in parenthesis . god save our country . this will not be done by following the christo-fascists that controlled the halls of congress for over 10 years prior to november , 2006 !
has there ever been a movie more charming than this ? one of the reasons everything works so well is that the group of actors really seem to interact and have an effect on each other 's lives . the center of it is the `` romance '' of james stewart and margaret sullavan , who work together and ca n't get along face to face but who completely connect with each other anonymously as pen pals . but there are also supporting characters and unlike a lot of romantic comedies ( including `` you 've got mail '' , the recent update of `` shop '' ) they 're not just whipped up to support the two leads and their needs . everyone gets to be an intricate part of ernst lubitsch 's rich tapestry of charm . one of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history takes place when the near-tragic frank morgan casually and humbly searches for someone to have christmas dinner with . a must see ! * * * * out of * * * *
i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend , sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy . the plot is simplistic , but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable ( even the well bread suspected serial killer ) . while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 : risk addiction , i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love . this was the most i 'd laughed at one of woody 's comedies in years ( dare i say a decade ? ) . while i 've never been impressed with scarlet johanson , in this she managed to tone down her `` sexy '' image and jumped right into a average , but spirited young woman . this may not be the crown jewel of his career , but it was wittier than `` devil wears prada '' and more interesting than `` superman '' a great comedy to go see with friends .
featuring a few of hammer 's all-stars , this highly effective slice of british horror revolves around a house and the fates of it 's previous tenants , whose stories are all told to a scotland yard detective , in search of a missing actor . story number one , which is probably the least impressive of the four , deals with a writer and his wife who 've just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels . he creates a demented character named dominic , who 's a very creepy looking strangler , and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes . after his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help , a sub-plot is introduced which frankly , did n't really work for me . i wo n't spoil it for you . the next story ( the best in my opinion ) stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson , a man who 's moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum ( that deals in the macabre ) where he 's very startled to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past . soon thereafter , an old friend ( who also has a history with this woman ) is in town for business and drops by to see him . the two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye . story three stars one of my very favorites ... christopher lee , who plays john reid . after moving into the home with his peculiar daughter jane , the nanny that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way reid suppresses his daughter . well come to find out ... if she knew what lee did , she would have certainly understood . the final story is a rather light-hearted vampire tale that stars john pertwee and ingrid pitt . after buying a cloak from a mysterious merchant , actor paul henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that he 's portrayed several times in his career . overall , the pacing and direction were very good , as was the most of the performances . there were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the ambiance . this one 's a keeper , and comes highly recommended .
this movie can be interpreted on many different levels . do n't listen to the other comments bashing the movie and saying that it is a played again story or w/e and that it is just about drugs . it has very overt superficial metaphors about drugs ; however , the rest of the movie ( and why i think it was personally made ) is really not about that at all . it is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society . it shows , for a split second , that the main character 's brother is watching those sick videos online . why ? my interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all of this gruesomeness that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions instead of seeing people as people . as far as the scene about logic , it is also reaching out to the people who were in the federally mandated 1 % smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life is n't as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level . you have to apply heisenberg 's uncertainty principle ( along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty ) not just to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and adjust along the way . one of the best movies i have ever seen . it just might go way above your head ; it is n't for you it is for those people who are are having trouble coping with life not working out like a math problem . when you are critically analyzing a movie or writing your critical review 's try not reading the back cover first ( written by marketers and parapsychologists )
your average garden variety psychotic nutcase ( deliciously essayed with unhinged glee by stephen sachs ) knocks off various dim-witted young `` adults '' ( to use the term very loosely ) in dayton hall university , which is being closed down for demolition . featuring dreadful acting by the entire cast ( daphne zuniga makes her ignominious and inauspicious film debut here as debbie , a bimbo who has her head crushed by a car ! ) , a hefty corpse tally of 10 , okay make-up f/x by matthew mungle , a few bloody murders ( baseball bat bludgeoning , chicken wire strangulation , your standard drill through the head bit , that sort of gruesome thing ) , a downbeat surprise twist ending which was later copied in `` intruder , '' a creepy score by christopher ( `` hellraiser '' ) young , a slight smidgen of gratuitous female nudity , and endearingly incompetent direction by jeffrey obrow and steve carpenter ( who also blessed us with `` the power '' and `` the kindred '' ) , this entertainingly abysmal slice'n'dice atrocity sizes up as a good deal of delectably dopey and drecky low-grade fun .
having seen cube , i 've been a fan of vincenzo natali 's work . natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline , and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster . instead , he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways , so much in fact , that you may in fact believe there is this cube were people try to escape , or in the case of nothing , a large empty expanse where there is ... nothing ! the advert had me hooked instantly . it seemed so simple ! take two characters who no one likes , and send them to a world where there is nothing . natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing can not exist . in fact , the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film . there 's nothing there , but also 'something ' there . it might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading . i was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so . therefore upon watching the film , i laughed every now and again , whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused . if i may take a minute to give the film some praise , where the film excels on is the concept . it is a genius concept to have a world of nothing , and to put two characters there , not two brilliant minded characters , who will philosophise and work out their surroundings , but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are ! another strong point is the film 's cinematography , though at first this may not seem it ! where each wall , north , earth , south , west , up and down is just a white plane , a perception of depth becomes faulty . it is hard to determine where things are placed in the mis-en-scene . the cinematography has many moments where this actually happens , but for the most part , the camera is placed so that two characters , or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background , allowing a sense of depth to be realised . however , this film does lack in certain areas . the film is relatively short , but even so , after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull , and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot . we can also argue that the acting is once again , questionable . these two characters are in a sense , unlikeable , therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters . however , on a flip side of that , the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough , but there is something lacking . even so , i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film ! do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science-fiction horror film . it is much more of a comedy than that ! it is indeed worth watching though , purely for the concept itself !
`` le locataire '' ( `` the tenant '' ) is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made.polanski stars as a trelkovsky , a timid file clerk living in paris , who answers an advertisement for an apartment , only to find that the previous tenant attempted suicide by leaping from the apartment window.trelkovsky is compelled to visit her in the hospital and there he meets stella ( isabelle adjani ) .trelkovsky immediately moves in when the previous tenant dies and , at first , is quite pleased with having found such a nice apartment.his happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbours , who seem to be trying to provoke trelkovsky into repeating the previous tenant 's suicide.this film is great.polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of dread and paranoia.plenty of brilliant moments such as the classic scene where trelkovsky discovers the previous tenant 's tooth in a hole in the wall , or the fever dream where he wanders into the building 's bathroom to find the walls covered with hieroglyphics.the photography by sven nykvist is truly beautiful . `` the tenant '' is a neglected gem.it may be difficult to track down , but it is more than worth the effort .
fully deserving its prestigious hollywood award nomination , this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some delightful surprises . outstandingly funny scenes include an hilarious shoot ( and re-shoot ) of a ww1 trench scene with australian comedian clyde cook as an optimistic non-com and the hapless mcdoakes as a boyer/colman messenger  all under the beady eye of ralph sanford 's delightfully irascible anguish ; a lost mcdoakes guided and re-guided by equally perplexed jack carson ; assistant director chandler rejoicing in a mcdoakes-sent opportunity : `` i 'm going to be a director ! '' ace comic o'hanlon has a dual role , playing both mcdoakes and himself playing mcdoakes ! oddly , richard l. bare who does play himself in one or more other entries in the series , has turned down that opportunity here . in real life , bare 's a youngish , six-foot rock hudson lookalike , but here he 's impersonated by veteran actor ( over 500 movies ! ) , jack mower .
one of the most unheralded great works of animation . though it makes the most sophisticated use of the `` cut-out '' method of animation ( a la `` south park '' ) , the real talent behind `` twice upon a time '' are the vocal characterizations , with lorenzo music 's ( carlton from tv 's `` rhoda '' ) woody allen-ish ralph-the-all-purpose-animal being the centerpiece . the `` accidental nightmare '' sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed .
throughout this film , you might think this film is just for kids . well , it is mainly pointed towards them , but it 's also well-rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience . this time around , the muppet gang try to get on broadway , with the dire straits keeping them from getting it produced , leading them to splitting up . but kermit wo n't stop , and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia ! it 's a send-up , in part , of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical , only here there 's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments ( lou zealand 's boomerang fish ; gonzo 's water-stunt display , the whisper campaign , among many others ) , but also with a lot of heart too . the muppet writers are n't shy of the conventions , on the contrary , they embrace them to the point where it 's almost refreshing to see such a 'lets put on a show ' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream . while not as totally original in scope as the muppet movie , it 's got many catchy and memorable songs , excellent locations all over manhattan , and even some intonations of inter-species dating ( and marriage ) ! cameos include liza minneli ( `` a frog ? `` ) , elliot gould ( as the cop ) , brooke shields ( propositioned by a rat ) , edward i. koch , gregory hines and joan rivers . so get ready to sing-along , or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic ( yes romantic ) times with one of the best muppet movies .
i liked this movie a lot . the animation was well done and the romance was cute . i liked most of bryan adams ' songs and the hans zimmer score was excellent . what a lot of people do n't realize is how well it relates to the heart of darkness/apocalypse now themes ( what happens when so-called `` civilization '' invades someone elses home , what does it mean to be `` civilized '' etc. ) . the opening scenery and music were very stirring . the film is a lament to an america that was once beautiful .
i saw this movie on the hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful , especially since it was based on a true man . pierce brosnan was very good as the loner english man who took on the persona of the half breed grey owl . the photography was beautiful . this movie made me do more research into this character archie belaney known simple as grey owl . i want to read as much as i can about him . at the time i did not know richard attenborough had directed it . but i am not surprised . i like all his movies whether he is acting or directing . i gave it the highest rating . however , i would have liked to have seen more in the movie about why he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house . you ca n't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes .
this movie will go down down in history as one of the greats , right along side of citizen kane , casablanca , and on the waterfront . someone please convince leno to do a sequel ! leno and morita are a comedy duo , the likes of which have n't been seen since abbot and costello . the evil that emanates from chris sarandon , tom noonan , and randall `` tex '' cobb will give you the chills . dingman 's character as the buffoonish oaf hearkens back to the days of shakespeare 's comedies . and the climax . my goodness , the climax . i wo n't ruin it for you , but it makes the explosion of the death star pale in comparison . if you can track down this hard-to-find gem , do yourself and your family a favor and buy it immediately . i 'm still holding out hope for a special edition dvd one of these days .
but the rest of us , who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to get you crying .. enjoy ! tom hulce is magnificent as dominick , a mentally slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother , eugene , played by ray liotta , who is a doctor and who works very long hours . due to eugene 's work schedule , dominick is alone a lot of the time and tends to make questionable judgment calls . he really just wants to be a good boy , to do the right thing , and to make his brother proud of him . he stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started . not about to give anything away here , but the movie is extremely involving and sad and heartbreaking . those unafraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story , its loving characters and a great song i can not quote here , that has nothing to do with the movie at all but is strangely appropriate .. but you hear it in a bar . i thought tom hulce would be nominated for this movie , since he was for 'amadeus ' i figured that might give him the inside track to actually winning . no such luck . liotta is just as good but has less of an emotional impact , but then he does later on . all i can say about jamie lee curtis is that she does n't have much of a part here but it was nice of her to lend her name to a small drama set in pittsburgh about two brothers who you will never forget .
`` the groove tube '' was one of only two ken shapiro movies , the other one being the equally zany `` modern problems '' . this one is just a full-scale parody of tv . aside from shapiro - who apparently did n't do anything after `` modern problems '' - the movie also stars chevy chase and henry winkler 's cousin richard belzer . the three cast members ( plus some other people in smaller roles ) appear in various skits . one of the funniest ones features chase in a geritol-spoofing commercial , in which he 's describing the medicine as his wife strips , and it ends with her humping him . there 's also a pornographic news program , an irritating cooking show , and the epic tale of some drug dealers . anyway , the whole thing 's just a real hoot . in my opinion , the three best tv-spoofing movies are this one , plus `` tunnelvision '' and `` kentucky fried movie '' ( although i might also include `` the truman show '' ) . really funny . i wonder what ever did become of ken shapiro .
i saw `` the grudge '' yesterday , and wow ... i was really scared , a good thing . i love horror-movies , and i really liked this one . there were so many 'surprise'-scenes ( what 's the english word ? ) that made you jump in your seat . though , too much screaming from the audience made it difficult not to laugh . i think the most scary scene was ... on the bus , when the face flashes by on the window , or when yoko 's walking without her chin . the make-up is also very good . sometimes you could really see it was there , but it was still adding a freaky look to the scene . the boy was very good indeed , so cute without make-up and so terribly scary with it on . the next time i hear a cracking noise i will probably feel pretty scared ...
this adaptation of pearl s. buck 's film is certainly a classic . a true hollywood epic , it has all the things a great hollywood film has : birth , death , happiness , sadness , exhilaration , despair , and so on . there is only one thing that irks me . i know it was a sign of the times , but neither of the two main characters are played by asian actors . paul muni was a great actor , and he does an admirable job as wang lung , the owner of a farm in china . luise rainier plays olan . she does not even look chinese ! i think she tried to get the role , but they should have put anna may wong in the role . i know why they did n't , and ms. rainier is very good in the film , but they hardly tried to make her look `` authentic '' . stillm its a great film , especially if you read the book ( i did in high school , decades ago ) . its a must see , just look beyond the casting . i think you can .
probably bigas luna 's finest achievement for it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze , eroticism and surrealism . the delicious mathilda may , who spent most of tobe hooper 's `` lifeforce '' in the buff , is the object of young biel duran 's pre-teen lust . he ca n't get may 's breasts out of his mind and wants so badly to suckle them and suckle the breasts of his own mother , too . his pursuit of may is the film . as in luna works such as `` lulu '' and `` jamon ! jamon ! `` , the director brings a slightly warped sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful tale . the usual suspects will be offended , but those with open minds will enjoy this frothy erotic poem to the female breast . josé luis alcaine 's images are gorgeous and nicola piovani 's score is sweet and rich . a gorgeous cinematic confection with a delightfully anarchic sensibility that the spanish do so naturally .
very good except for the ending which was a huge disappointment . the script was very good as was the acting . the visuals were often very grainy but this in a way added to the film as the snowy features were in good places that helped create a mood towards the film . this affect was ruined by the extremely unbelievable ending . i was going to give this film an 8 out of ten but the ending knocked it down a point to 7 because it seemed to depart radically from the first 75 minutes of the movie and seemed quite forced at the end to make the film makers look clever . this movie though was much better than films with quite a lot larger budgets and seemed to be filmed like a home movie with some extra equipment . not much in the way of special effects as these go but for suspense it was very good .
until i saw this special on hbo , i had never heard of eddie izzard . i sure am glad that i have now ! he is one of the funniest comedians i have ever seen ! rarely has a comedian immersed himself so completely in his craft then eddie . i could not stop laughing for the entire show . if you like to laugh you have to see this special !
gillian holroyd ( kim novak ) is a witch . secretly , she 's attracted to her quite normal neighbor shep henderson ( james stewart ) . she casts a spell on shep that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her . things are going along quite nicely until gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man . she decides to tell him her secret . but how will shep react when he finds out that he was `` tricked '' into falling in love with gillian ? as far as light-hearted 1950s comedies go , bell book and candle is good , but nothing spectacular . it 's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it . just do n't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since sliced bread . the movie 's cute , funny at times , and touching in the end . kim novak and james stewart do their best and have some real chemistry . novak ( as others have pointed out ) looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way . the supporting cast with jack lemmon , hermione gingold , and elsa lanchester is often laugh-out-loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from novak and stewart . the biggest problem i see is that bell book and candle ca n't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be . is it a screwball comedy ? is it a romantic comedy ? is it a supernatural comedy ? had director richard quine stuck with just one approach , the movie might have been even better and more memorable .
this is one of those movies that you keep thinking about when you wake up the next morning . it will give you that warm , fuzzy feeling and leave you with a smile on your face . sure , we get fed the typical stereotype characters and stories , but it does do the trick : entertain . being from sweden and living in the us for quite sometime , it is funny how we react . `` the deadbeat husband is going to kill him '' , `` she ( gabriella ) is going to die and then there will be a heartbreaking larger-than-life ending '' . we know how these things work , everything comes together at the end . and it did . the characters were somewhat simple , they were so elaborate that you did n't really think twice about it , nothing was really left for your own imagination . the closest would probably be siv , she makes you ask yourself if she indeed was in love with daniel , but that 's about it . but the movie is beautiful , set in rural norrland , the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are lovable . michael nyqvist is truly genius , with his crazy unique look and frida hallberg is charming and approachable . maybe a little too nice . but most of all this movie makes you feel , and that is the most important thing . you cry , you laugh , you hate and you identify . i do n't know about you guys , but that does not happen that often .
i saw this in the theater and i instantly thought that it is good enough to own on video . i am a big nut for sci-fi action flicks though anyway . without giving any of the story away , it is worth seeing if you like sci-fi without requiring much thought . the story is basic , and the plot is very good . worth your time to see ! maybe they will make a sequel ? : ) 8 out of 10
`` night of the living homeless '' was a fairly strong finish to the first half of season 11 . obviously a parody of various zombie movies , most notably dawn of the dead , this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead , as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains . kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he , out of the goodness of his heart , gives a $ 20 to a homeless man in front of his house . more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park , until the town is completely overrun with them . this is a very strong randy marsh episode , as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center . but before randy makes it to the community center , he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming `` i do n't have any change ! ! '' unfortunately , the refugees end up losing gerald broflofski to the homeless , when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town , and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people . then he becomes one of them , asking everyone for change . the boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park , and find a man who is a director of homeless studies . they find out that the nearby city of evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless , so they escape to evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem . unfortunately , homeless people break into the man 's house , and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself . however , he fails several times , as he shoots himself in the jaw , in the eye , in the chest , in the neck , in the shoulder , screaming horribly until he finally dies . this scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in `` fantastic easter special '' two weeks ago . meanwhile , a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem , the property values have nosedived , thus the bank has foreclosed on his house , making him homeless . randy immediately turns on him , holding the gun to the man 's head . when the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out , randy pulls the trigger . in evergreen , the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to south park , and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country . the boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of south park and takes them all the way to santa monica , california . the zombie movie parallels and the great randy marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable . 8/10
wow . one of the greatest movies i have ever - ever seen . absolutely loved it ! before the opening credits were done i was glued to the screen . it 's a sci-fi thriller - and edge of your seat whodunnit . incredible . i wish 'd it would never end . lucy liu is a throwaway role . anyone could have played it . the lead actor , jeremy northram was the perfect geeky guy . this movie appeals to me who loved war games , sneakers , and track down . incredible ! 8-22-06 . walt d in lv
the jist : see something else . this film was highly rated by gene siskel , but after watching it i ca n't figure out why . the film is definitely original and different . it even has interesting dialogue at times , some cool moments , and a creepy `` noir '' feel . but it just is n't entertaining . it also does n't make a whole lot of sense , in plot but especially in character motivations . i do n't know anyone that behaves like these characters do . this is a difficult movie to take on -- i suggest you do n't accept the challenge .
a meteorite falls in the country of a small town , bringing a jelly creature . an old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand , and the youths steve andrews ( steve mcqueen ) and his girlfriend jane martin ( aneta corsaut ) take him to dr. t. hallen ( steven chase ) . the local doctor treats carefully the blister , and asks steve to investigate the location where they found the old man . when steve returns , he sees the blob killing the doctor . steve and jane try to warn the police and the dwellers , but nobody believe on them , while the blob engulfs many people , getting bigger and bigger . `` the blob '' is a cult and classic sci-fi . it is a low budget movie , with many ham actors and actresses ( with the exception of steve mcqueen ) , awful effects , but also delightful and very , but very funny . this is the first time that i see this classic ( i had seen the 1988 remake with kevin dillon ) , and i really recommend it to fans of steve mcqueen and sci-fi b-movies from the 50s . the film subject of my review number 1,400 could not be better . my vote is seven . title ( brazil ) : `` a bolha '' ( `` the blob '' )
the production quality , cast , premise , authentic new england ( waterbury , ct ? ) locale and lush john williams score should have resulted in a 3-4 star collectors item . unfortunately , all we got was a passable 2 star `` decent '' flick , mostly memorable for what it tried to do ......... bring an art house style film mainstream . the small town locale and story of ordinary people is a genre to itself , and if well done , will satisfy most grownups . jane fonda was unable to hide her braininess enough to make her character believable . i wondered why she was n't doing a post doctorate at yale instead of working in a dead end factory job in waterbury . robert diniro 's character was just a bit too contrived . an illiterate , nice guy loser who turns out to actually be , with a little help from jane 's character , a 1990 version of henry ford or thomas edison . this genre has been more successfully handled by `` nobody 's fool '' in the mid 90s and this year 's ( 2003 ) `` about schmidt . '' i wish that the main stream studios would try more stuff for post adolescents and reserve a couple of screens at the multi cinema complexes for those efforts . i 'll give it an `` a '' for effort .
the whole does not even come close to the sum of the parts . no problem . this film features a line-up of some of the most diversely creative directors of our time and some really famous names in the cast . the segments are devised around the same theme , `` love in paris '' , but the resemblance ends there . actually , considering that the approach to the theme from all these different directors takes so many forms , it is amazing that we can even feel we are still watching the same film . no great effort has been made to turn it into a comprehensive whole . this buffet has so many great ingredients , i am glad nobody tried to put them all in a single dish .
one of the best `` amitabh comeback '' movies i liked . this was the phase when govinda was going strong with dhawan . the songs were awesome and totally as we call it `` masti '' type . an evergreen entertainer with the likes of the multifaceted anupam kher chipping in . the story line has a lot of hilarious twists and turns as is known for david dhawan 's potboilers . with a timely appearance by mrs.madhuri `` nene '' dixit , it was a total riot towards the end . it was great to see amit perform with such force and humor after a long exile . although some may consider it a typical `` bollywood masala '' movie , i would watch it any day . i am giving it an easy 8 out of 10 just for being pure bollywood .
in my opinion , october sky is one of the best movies of 1999 ... it totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need , like , wonderful story and good character interactions . october sky will remain in heart for as long as i can remember , and i just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film .
if i could go back , even as an adult and relive the days of my summer 's spent at camp ... i would be there so fast . the camps i went to were n't even this great . they were in texas where the mosquitoes actually carry people off but we had horses and fishing . the movie cinematography was astounding , the characters funny and believable especially perkins , pollack and arkin . sam raimi 's character and sub-antics were priceless . so who ever thought this movie was lame ... i have deep pity for because they ca n't suspend their disbelief long enough to imagine camp life again as an adult or they never went as kids . the whole point was that these people had an opportunity to regress and become juvenile again and so they did at every opportunity . i wish i could . it was funny , intelligent , beautifully scripted , brilliantly cast and the artistry takes me back so i want to watch it over and over just for the scenery even . sorta like dances with wolves and ladyhawk ... good movies but the wilderness becomes a character as much as the actors . rent it , see it , buy it and watch it over and over and over ... never gets old . ; 0 )
yes , i call this a perfect movie . not one boring second , a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors , a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with , perfect lighting , crisp black and white photography , a fitting soundtrack , an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works . it 's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest , the mark everyone should endeavor to reach . barbara stanwyck is simply stunning . there was nothing this actress could n't do , and she always went easy on the melodramatic side . no hysterical outbursts with this lady - i always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford , and this movie confirmed my opinion . always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments . it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career , and this one is by far the least interesting . the title fits this movie very well . it is about desires , human desires i think everyone can understand . actually , no one seems to be scheming in this movie , all characters act on impulse , everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else . the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here . i liked what this movie has to say about youth , about maturing and about the necessity to compromise . the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock 's shadow of a doubt , it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america . the story has a certain similarity with fritz lang 's considerably harsher movie clash by night , made one year earlier , where stanywck stars in a similar part . i can also recommend it .
i 'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler , but i 'm playing it safe , so do n't read this if you have n't seen the movie . i adore this movie , and so does everyone i work with -- and that is the point . i spent a large part of my working life in cinema , without being an actor . such people are the _sung_ heroes of this movie : the gaffers , the pullers , the on-air directors , the lighters and writers , the costume people etc etc , and the whole thing is told from their point of view , at least to a great extent . most actors are nuts and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity , which is what this movie spoofs so well , but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real-life drama ! possible spoiler alert : in one great scene , the two leads , both actors , are _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal , something entirely 'out-of-script ' , with another actor , and they start making up lines , rehearsing them , and critiquing each other 's performance . since this movie appeared in , what was it , '91 , it has become fashionable to do this , especially on tv . but hardly anyone has done it so well .
i really liked this film when it was released , and i still do , because the storyline makes you feel hopeful about life in general , and people too ... one of the things i like about the films of lawrence kasdan . in addition to the positive vibes from the film , there are other reasons to like grand canyon . for one thing , it has an outstanding cast ... kevin kline and danny glover , for example . in my opinion , crash , the highly acclaimed film that won the oscar for best picture , was very similar to this film . the difference is that grand canyon leaves you feeling positive . crash had the opposite effect with me ; it was very dark . i would choose grand canyon over crash any day .
roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time , as the mind behind classics such as `` rosemary 's baby '' and `` chinatown '' . probably what makes polanski 's cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces , he is also fond of making low-key movies that are of a more personal nature . `` le locataire '' , or `` the tenant '' , is one of those movies ; a horror/suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done . polanski himself plays telkovsky , a young man looking for an apartment in france . when he finally finds one , he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant , simone choule , attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window . after simone dies of the injuries , trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her , to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building . while sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other `` apartment-themed '' films ( `` repulsion & `` rosemary 's baby '' ) ; this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovsky 's head , the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind , and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant . trelkovsky 's descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski . while at first his performance seems odd and wooden , slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way ; as a simpleton with almost no life , who traps himself in this maddening sub-world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people . the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film . also , the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation , and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky . the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive . if a flaw is to be found in the film , is that it is definitely a bit slow at first . this may sound like a turn-off but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovsky 's own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm . also , the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has . however , more than a flaw , it is a joy to face a thought-provoking plot like this one . while `` the tenant '' may not be for everyone , those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience . `` le locataire '' is really one of roman polanksi 's masterpieces . 10/10
this is real character and story driven drama at a level that shames most of what we see on tv at the mo . i was impressed right from the start . do n't be put off if your not a sci fi nut ( like me ... ) this could be happening on earth , the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting . there are no space ships or laser guns ( none yet anyway ) so far i 've seen up to s01 e04 and i 'm gripped and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilities . the cast play there roles with pasion . eric stoltz is especially strong . this show really stands alone well , it does n't matter if you watched bsg or not , in fact they are quite different . i 've read some negative reviews from sci fi geeks who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc but i would say ignore them . this is a really positive start to a show . lets hope they do n't cann it after 1 or 2 seasons like they normally do with good shows these days .
i agree that capital city should be on dvd . i watched this show only by accident in 1994 and fell in love with rolf saxon as hudson talbot . it was nice to see americans who work abroad in london in the financial industry for a change . i loved rolf in this role and loved every other role that he has been in . i ca n't believe the show only lasted 13 episodes . i liked william armstrong as hudson 's flamboyant charming friend in the series . when they aired this show in the new york city area , it was always late at night or at off times . the show is less than an hour long . i felt this show should have gone on longer but the casting changes in the second season really made the show a little less interesting . i did n't care for sylvia but missed the actress , julia phillips-lane in the previous season . i felt this show took chances and often it worked . it showed americans who loved and chose to live in london . the american characters were not arrogant or tried to outdo their british counterparts . i also liked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all british . i liked watching julia ormond in an early role . i felt this show should have lasted longer . i felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour . they could have transferred the cast to new york city and it would have been a hit in america .
once again jet li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film black mask . in this film li plays tsui , an escapee from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him . to do this tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life , but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace . other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as tsui , but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace . thus tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives . this film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go . the martial arts is amazing , but because it uses wires it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by american audiences . if you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts , then black mask is for you . i am glad to see that some of jet li 's movies are finally getting main stream release in the united states and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require ( things like dubbing and soundtrack ) will affect the film . this is one of li 's best films , go out and see it on may 14 when it is released in america .
okay . this movie is a pure pleasure . it has the ever so violent horror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy . the dentist really starts to loose his mind and it 's enjoyable to watch him do so . this movie is for certain people , though . either you 'll completely love it or you will totally hate it . a good movie to rent and watch when you do n't got anything else to do . also recommended : psycho iii
i just read the plot summary and it is the worst one i have ever read . it does not do justice to this incredible movie . for an example of a good summary , read the listing at `` turner classic movies '' . anyway , this was one of my favorite movies as a young child . my sister and i could n't wait until every april when we could see it on t.v . it is one of the best horse movies of it 's time . it is one of those great classics that the whole family can watch . the romance is clean and endearing . the story line is interesting and the songs are great . they do n't make movies like this anymore . good acting and not over the top . pat boone and shirley jones are at their best , along with many other great character actors .
in rosenstrasse , margarethe von trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage . the film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter , and the story of german women who staged a protest on rosenstrasse to free their jewish husbands from certain extermination . in addition to the dramatization of historical events , the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the holocaust by a german and the result of the child 's experience of losing her mother . while ms. von trotta shows that the courage of a small number of germans made a difference , she does not use it to excuse german society . indeed , she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination , the wealthy artists and intellectuals of german high society went on about their lives and parties , oblivious to the suffering . rosenstrasse opens in new york as a jewish widow ruth weinstein ( jutta lampe ) decides to sit shiva , a seven-day period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased . when her daughter hannah ( maria schrader ) , is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fiancé luis ( fedja van huet ) , a non-jew , hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an orthodox tradition that she previously rejected . when ruth coldly rejects her cousin , hannah questions her and learns about a woman named lena who took ruth in as a child when the latter 's mother was deported and murdered by the nazis , and she vows to find lena and discover the secret of her mother 's past . her quest takes her to berlin where she finds lena ( doris schade ) , now ninety years old , and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the holocaust . with unfailing memory , lena tells her story of how , as a young 33-year old woman ( katja reimann ) , she searched for her husband , jewish pianist fabian israel fischer ( martin feifel ) , who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given jews in mixed marriages . lena , in a radiant performance by reimann , discovers that her husband and other jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the rosenstrasse . standing together in the freezing night , german women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building , their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting `` give us back our husbands '' . lena finds ruth ( svea lohde ) , a young girl whose mother is in the building . she takes care of her , protecting her from the gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed . lena comes from an aristocratic german family and her brother , recently returned from stalingrad , is a wehrmacht officer . after being refused help from her father to free fabian she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow officer , `` i know what they do to the jews . i saw it '' . given his support , she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the minister of culture , joseph goebbels , a known womanizer . while this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters , it is a historical fact that goebbels was very active in making the decisions affecting rosenstrasse . the director margarethe von trotta , an activist , feminist , and intellectual , is no stranger to political drama . she directed a film about socialist rosa luxembourg and marianne and julianne , a story of the relationship between two sisters , one of whom resorts to political violence to accomplish her liberal objectives . in rosenstrasse , a film she worked on for eight years , she had to make compromises , adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced . that it works so well is a tribute to ms. von trotta 's artistry and the beautiful screenplay by pamela katz whose father was a refugee from leipzig . the events at rosenstrasse give the lie to germans , who say , `` there was nothing we could do '' . now von trotta has shown the opposite to be true , that something could be done to resist the nazis . it is tragic that the example did not catch on .
yes , the plot is predictable ; yes , there are a few plot holes ; yes , it has a made-for-tv quality ; and yes , britney spears `` wrote '' the book with obvious self-promotion . but forget all of that ... this movie is fun . fun in an after school special sort-of-way , but fun nevertheless . virginia madsen as the mother does a great job ... so good that i 'm going to start watching for her movies . she reminded me of diane lane for all the good reasons . the rest of the cast does a fine job , too . if i was a casting agent , i 'd be scouting some of these young actors . the production values are above usual tv standards and the music was really great ... better than several big-budget movies i 've seen . if you 're in the mood for german noir this movie is n't for you . if you want a safe , fun and underrated movie , this is a good one . it 's one you could show to your 10 year old daughter but enjoy it yourself too .
steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he would n't win by directing special effects epics ( he was nominated for three of them : `` close encounters of the third kind '' , `` raiders of the lost ark '' , and `` e.t . : the extra-terrestrial '' . so he decided to get very serious by directing `` the color purple '' , a period film with no special effects . spielberg 's first serious drama is a remarkable movie . but the academy voters who voted back in 1985 still did n't give spielberg any respect . `` the color purple '' received 11 oscar nominations including best picture , but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he was n't nominated for best director . it got worse on oscar night when this film did n't win a single oscar . it got completely shut out . that was n't right . `` the color purple '' should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldberg 's spectacular film debut as celie , a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband ( frightfully placed by danny glover ) , then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends . oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia , one of those friends ' of celie . since i 'm from chicago , i had already known winfrey from her talk show ( which at the time of this films ' release had n't gone nationwide ) . like goldberg , what a film debut ! margaret avery is terrific as shug avery , another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celie 's rotten husband . all three actresses received well-deserved oscar nominations for their work here ( goldberg for best actress ; winfrey and avery for best supporting actress ) . set in the south during the first half of the 20th century , `` the color purple '' is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end . it also made me laugh at times too . why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today . but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for `` schindler 's list '' and `` saving private ryan '' , making him one of the best movie directors of all-time . but he should have gotten nominated for this movie . the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like `` e.t . '' to a serious drama like `` the color purple '' was remarkable . * * * * ( out of four )
gurinda chada 's semi-autobiographical film ( 2002 ) is a gentle , poignant comedy set in the ethnically diverse community near heahthrow airport in west london . like the airliners which constantly arrive and depart from overhead , we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters jess bhamra ( parminder nagra ) and jules paxton ( keira knightley ) as they strike up an unlikely friendship which centres around their mutual passion for soccer and their technical infatuation with david beckham . much of the comedy grows out of the misunderstandings of the families of these two talented girls as they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds . somewhere in the middle , as broker , peacemaker and blighted athlete , joe ( jonathan reece-myers ) - team coach for the hounslow harriers - intercedes in times of crisis , while at the same time remaining the main object of affection of both the main characters . eventually , and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the way , we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroines soaring away to realise their dreams . with great performances from bollywood veteran anupam kher ( mr bhamra ) , shaheen khan ( mrs bhamra ) , juliet stevenson ( mrs paxton ) and frank harper ( mr paxton ) this really is a film that captures the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic frontiers . pinky bamrha ( archie panjabi ) and ( taz ) trey farley are struggling their own struggles , but nevertheless contribute greatly to our understanding of the main characters in the film . in it 's own special way , this film tells an important story that in quite incidental the football . it celebrates the evolution in the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of the young to teach the old .
its too bad a lot of people did n't understand this and the next episode . but do n't worry ! ill explain it too you : ) this episode is split in 2 parts . first part is tony 's `` dream '' in his coma . second part is what happens in real life . now what people did n't understand is that tony 's dream is more then just a dream . in this episode its about his preparation for his death . he loses his own identity and eventually even forgets himself , thus he disconnects all his bindings with this world . you will notice what i 'm saying at the doctor scene , where tony says he has lost his briefcase which contains `` his life '' . they makers really did a superb job of interpreting they 're own thoughts of what happens when you die . if you understand the whole plot you will find this and the next episode an unique thing , with great spiritual meanings . like every sopranos episode the acting and filming is superb . only thing i did n't understand was what the role where of the monks . gon na re watch it till i get this . anyways this episode really touched me , and i do n't think anyone else can make a better view of what happens in a almost death experience . 10/10 no doubt .
i think you would have to be from the usa to get a lot of the jokes . but if you liked princess bride and forest gump , you would like this movie . you ca n't compare the quality of the filming to those of course , but having the cameraman trip was obviously done on purpose . killer tomatoes is a hundred times better than nepolean dynamite . just my opinion . i 'm sure that people from france would not appreciate the caricatures of the french . so this film is n't for a world audience . and while i am not a trained film critic , i know what i like . i could n't stop laughing through the whole movie . my sides and my jaws were hurting at the end of the movie .
the performance by om puri , smita patil , and sadashiv amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes off nicely , along with the minimalist approach to story telling and direction by govind nihlani . the dialogues by vijay tendulkar is also great . i have not seen another movie like this . it is one whole , each piece so nicely fit in the plot . you can not not be impressed by this movie . amrish puri comes off as the bossy husband and 'baap ' of om puri . om puri is the young man caught between his sense of duty and his inability to fight the system . sadhashiv as rama shetty gives just about the right touch to the movie with his smiling and soft speaking villain . the first meeting of anand velankar with rama shetty 's at sadhashiv 's place is absoulely stunning . smita patil does not play a main role , but her part is also not distracting from the main plot . and to add to this all kafi inamdar plays the role of a cop who has come to terms with the system and its workings . saying right things in the right places and knowing how to keep himself away from trouble . he is also the 'guru ' of om puri and helps him whenever he gets into trouble . the movie not only brings to focus the difficulties faced by a police officer trying to do his duty but also the other side of brutalities in police custody . om puri captures hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional performance in ardh satya . a treat to all avid fans of indian cinema .
this film is a great example of fine storytelling . the acting is superb . the story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake . there were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were , but considering it is a hollywood movie , they showed amazing restraint . there was n't a single explosion shown in the movie , even though they had one opportunity to . the film , while having suspenseful parts , was not made into an action movie . the story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times . well done !
i had heard good things about this film and was , you guessed it , a bit disappointed . reese witherspoon is as promised surprisingly good , surprisingly confident , at a young age ; really all the ( small ) cast are quite solid , in their simple 50s american setting . the reason i did n't rate this film higher is mainly that towards the end , the grief shown by the older sister did n't seem so real and this pulled me out of the film a bit . perhaps we are expected to fill in the plot , or perhaps the film needed to be a bit longer . maureen 's character is quite underdeveloped i think . it is understandable that dani ( reese w. , the younger ) would be traumatised and angry , but why is her sister shown to be more upset ? because she 's a few years older ? has n't the end rather undermined the rest of the film ? the pacing of the movie makes it seem that maureen and court have only just met , when he gets tractored ( warning : this scene is surprisingly brutal , in retrospect it seems like it might have been trying to shock a bit . well it works ! ) . it depends what you want - if you want the girls ' happy story of young love that it seems like you 're going to get , you 're in for a surprise . man in the moon is both quaint and dreamy and a harsh coming of age film  a rather awkward combination ? i liked the character of court though , i can see what girls watching this might be watching . and i loved that they had the courage to both let him hurt the younger sister ( most men would , most films would n't ) and get killed . 7/10 on my pretty harsh ratings scale . for some reason i found jason london on a tractor funny .
why is this movie not in the 250 best ? this movie looks still astoundingly fresh 56 years after its production but it could only have been made at the aftermath of w.w.ii because of the perception of the nearness of death . people were more aware that life could be stopped at one unexpected moment . and what after life ? i liked the scene at the end with the judgment and all people of all nations gathered . the phlegmatic judge ( abraham sofaer-a typical british judge- ) , doctor reeves ( roger livesey ) defending peter carter ( david niven ) and also june ( kim hunter ) against the american prosecutor abraham farlan ( raymond massey i -there is a reason why it is an american- ) . it is all so imaginative ! michael powell wrote , directed and produced this astonishing movie which is a real `` tour-de-force '' . the message of the movie is clear : in the universe the law is the most important but on earth nothing goes beyond the love between humans . the way in which this beautiful story is told is far more interesting than any hollywood-movie could ever make .
s.s. van dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with hollywood . most of the film series ' from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios . but apparently van dine must have sold his rights to each book about philo vance one at a time . note that paramount , mgm , warner brothers , and more all released philo vance films . only tarzan seemed to get around hollywood more . mgm produced the garden murder case and starred edmund lowe as the fashionable detective . of course mgm had the screen 's original philo under contract at the time , but bill powell was busy doing the thin man at the time and i guess louis b. mayer decided to concentrate him there . edmund lowe is a pretty acceptable philo vance . lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with what price glory and then with a string of films with victor mclaglen with their flagg and quirt characters . but after mclaglen got his oscar for the informer , lowe seemed to fade into the b picture market . the garden murder case involves three separate victims , douglas walton , gene lockhart , and frieda inescourt . the sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away , the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished . i will say this though . vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of hitchcock .
i saw this movie again as an assignment for my management class . were to mainly comment on the different management styles and ideas on quality ( of the product ) . i did rent this one back in the eighties and i remember it to be good ( but not great ) movie . i 've always liked michael keaton 's style and delivery . he was a perfect fit for the movie . i am surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie . i grant you yes it 's no oscar winner but it does have decent comedic value . it 's more of a subtle comedy rather than a all-out comedy farce . i also find some of those that felt this was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences . i beg to differ . i grant you again that there are a lot of generalities and dramatizations but then again this is hollywood film not a documentary . from what i 've read about differences between automakers on both sides of the pacific at that time many of the principle ideas were accurate for the time . some of the basic differences were that japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as a whole . teamwork was emphasized . they perhaps made the company above all else . where american workers had more of a management verses labor type of relationship . the individual was more important than the company . i 'll probably get some hate email over that comment i 'm sure . another difference was how quality was viewed and whose responsibility it was to fix . in many japanese plants defects or problems are examined and fixed at the time it is discovered . rather as one character in the movie put it `` it was the dealers ( meaning car dealer ) problem '' . many of these things are probably dated but i 'm sure some are still around as many us car makers are still struggling to keep up with the japanese . if one is more interested in the subject of american , european and japanese automakers i can recommend a book that studies this subject in more detail and was done around the same time period . the book is called `` the machine that changed the world '' by james womack , daniel jones and daniel roos . it 's about a study of automakers during and before the time period that this movie covers . parts are bit dry but i think you 'll find that it backs up much the movie also .
the kids i took to this movie loved it ( four children , ages 9 to 12 years ; they would have given it 10 stars ) . emma roberts was adorable in the title role . ( expect to see more of this next-generation roberts in the future . ) after being over exposed to the likes of britney spears , lindsay lohan , and paris hilton , it was refreshing to see a girl who did n't look like she worked the streets . also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast that included tate donovan , rachel leigh cook , barry bostwick , and monica parker ( with a cameo by bruce willis ) . final takeaway : cute film . ( note : i did not read the book series , so my comments are based on the merits of the film alone . )
loved it but still have nightmares over the hotel manager.the movie , was presented well , with the choice of actors carrying their roles to reality of the writing . many scenes gripped the imagination and created a nail biter . the progression of situations were cleverly written , making me believe the story was headed one way only to find a new twist on what i thought might be the obvious . too bad there have to be commercials.i have told many friends to watch for further showings and i of course will view again.i enjoyed the scenery of the film and felt this added to the plots and intrigue . husband and wife heated discussions ( or should i say fights ? ) were very realistic.the initial situation is a common one but the escalation into the story presented fortunately is not.i want to thank all who were involved in this great entertainment film . thank you ! looking forward to the next films -- -when ? whidbey
i saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it . i was very moved by this movie . i found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault . as in real life though sometimes people disappoint , as was the case with leo , who even though i liked his character i could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his hiv status . i was also disappointed with leo for rejecting the medicine available to him , and the awful way he treated marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train . i think this movie showed in a very real way why hiv numbers are up in young gay men . this is in no way meant to bash gays ( i am gay ) and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others . the only part of the movie i could n't understand was why the ( gay friendly ) family was unwilling to include marcel in leo 's illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral . i think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is do not have unprotected sex !
as has been well documented by previous posters , the real stars of rockstar : inxs - and , indeed it 's sequel , rockstar : supernova - are paul mirkovich , rafael moreira , jim mcgorman , nate morton and sasha krivtsov . do n't know who they are ? they are the awesome , tight , rockin ' house band whose music savvy and talent made this show something more than a sad american idol clone . remember the `` strings '' night ? that was musical precision and perfection if ever i 've seen it . suzie mcneil 's epic rendition of queen 's 'bohemian rhapsody ' , ty taylor 's memorable cover of the stones ' 'you ca n't always get ... ' , jd fortune singing `` suspicious minds '' . the common denominator here is the awesome house band . as good as inxs were in their prime , they are sadly a shadow of their former selves , though jd 's live performance has somewhat breathed new life into their music , this show is all about the hb . memo to producers : season three ( if we 're blessed enough to have it happen ) should be rockstar : house band . get those boys a good lead singer and they are going places .
i finally got myself set up on mail order dvd rental so i could find movies not available to me in the stores . i chose the souler opposite because i love christopher meloni , and also like small , often ignored films . this one is such a treat ! meloni has such charm in this part . it 's easy to pigeon hole him is you only ever see him as his alter ego elliot stabler ( losvu ) . in this film , meloni is an out of step unattached mid-lifer who is hitting the skids in many ways , only to find a path to happiness in someone unexpected . the relationship drawn between barry ( meloni ) and tim busfield 's character is realistic and not over done . i have n't seen busfield since 30something , and he was fun to watch . but it was all chris ' film . i became such a fan girl all over again . it is a bit slow in the beginning , i will admit . i thought some of the `` flashbacks '' could have been edited down . but overall , this film will delight you - male or female - as it has an honest , refreshing view of relationships today .
i just saw this film on turner classic movies last night and was blown away by victor mclaglen 's performance : in every sense of the word a `` tour de force '' . the atmosphere of 1922 dublin evoked through the cinematography and production design really foreshadowed techniques used in the best film noirs of the 40 's and early 50's.very nice attention to detail also ; during frankie mcphillip 's ( wallace ford 's ) wake , the mourners are all praying in gaelic . max steiner 's score is unforgettable . as in later films such as 1939 's gwtw , he appropriated folk ballads to lend local color and a sense of place and time . john ford : already a film giant in 1935 !
and this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself . no matter how it evolved ( at point being a movie about disco ) , it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out , but the principal stands in their way . think back to those rock'n'roll movies of the 50 's in which the day is saved when alan freed comes to town with chuck berry to prove that rock & roll music is really cool and safe for the kids , and tuesday weld gets a new sweater for the dance . forward to the 1979 , repeat the same plot , but throw in da ramones , whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century ( and then for the obligatory dj guest shot , `` the real '' don steele ) . throw in , too , all the elements of a roger corman-produced comedy-exploitation film , except for the two-day shooting schedule , some of the familiar corman repertory players like clint howard , mary wournow and dick miller ( there since `` bucket of blood '' ) , and you 've got one of the great stoopid movies of the day . one of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it . i showed the new dvd to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a stoner- induced haze at the drive-in , and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to be watching drunk , not the least for the lovely leading ladies and the great ramones footage .
ok , this movie starts out like a cheesy lifetime movie and does n't get better till almost well through the movie . the script is full of 'cheese ' and 'fluff ' and cast is not well directed for the most part . for the first half of the movie the little girl grated on my nerves . i do not think this is one of her best acting jobs . the only reason i bought the movie is because it was on sale and had ellen burstyn in it . she 's terrific but this is also not one of her best acting gigs . the story is based on true events and that helps the movie . actually , i did n't even like the movie at first and was getting disgusted when i saw stills of the balloon traveling , i mean .. let it get where it 's suppose to go and be done with it ! but all is forgiven by the time it does reach it 's destination and the story comes to a close . if this does n't bring a tear to your eye , nothing will ! it 's cheesy and predictable but also makes you feel good about the world again .
this is really a great unknown movie.perfect dialogue without the typical clichés.this movie relied on the actor 's talent and it was pulled off.it even had a little bit a comedy in it , but it was n't overdone.once in the life is what a crime drama is supposed to be , not the typical special affects garbage with sex thrown in.i especially loved the interracial aspects of it all . now onto the actors themselves . laurence fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal.it 's a shame that he 's only allowed to show his talent in his own movie . titus welliver was fabulous as fishburne 's junky half-brother . eamonn walker added flavor to the already perfectly spiced film . paul calderon was perfect as a grease monkey/drug lord.i loved his acting since `` king of new york '' . but the best acting in this film came from gregory hines and michael paul chan , who were paired perfectly as two of calderon 's henchmen . once in the life is for sure a keeper . * * * * 1/2 * out of * * * * * .
i used this film in a religion class i was teaching . the golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in an upper floor apartment . a young boy and his mother are away from home . the boy has been given money to buy milk . on the way home , he stops at carnival to play a game . next to him stands a man in a black suit looking a little scary . the boy drops the bottle of milk . it breaks . the man in the black suit gives him money to replace the milk . this scene alternates with what is happening at home . a black cat climbs the fire escape and enters the apartment . he ( ? ) discovers the fish bowl and watches it . the fish swims energetically and flips out of the bowl . by now , a bunch of teenagers in my class and i have fallen in love with the fish . the cat takes the fish in his mouth and we all hold our breath . the cat drops the fish into the bowl . the double story line includes the suspicious man in black and the suspicious black cat . both inspire prejudice . both are innocent . it was a great discussion starter in my class .
the legend of andrei konchalovsky 's towering 4 and a half hour poem to siberia is not to begin at once , because it must hold back for space , because it takes its time in roundabout explorations of half-remembered childhood memories in a turn-of-the-century backwoods village , yet the movie goes on picking up steam building in emotional resonance as though even the sounds and images which compose it become imbued by sheer association with their subject matter with that quality of fierce tireless quiet dignity that characterizes the soviet working spirit . konchalovsky celebrates soviet collectivity but in an almost revisionist way to paeans like soy cuba and invincible the mood turns somber and reflective . news of the revolution reach the secluded siberian village through the grapevine . the fruits of its labor reach it only when a world war calls for the young men to enlist . through all this , konchalovksy zeroes in on the individual , with care and affection to examine the bitter longing and regret of the woman who waited 6 years after the war for a fiancé who never came back , waited long enough to go out and become a barmaid in a ship with velvet couches and which she quit years later to come back to her village to care for an aging uncle who killed the fiancé 's father with an axe , the irreverent folly of the fiancé who came back from the war a hero 20 years too late , came back not for the sake of the girl he left behind but to drill oil for the motherland , the despair and resignation of the middle-aged regional party leader who comes back to his small siberian village with the sole purpose of blotting it out of the map to build a power plant . the movie segues from decade to decade from the 10 's to the 80 's with amazing newsreel footage trailing soviet history from the revolution to war famine and the titanic technological achievements of an empire ( terrific visuals here ! all kinetic violence and skewed angles and flickering cramped shots of crowds and faces ) but the actual movie focuses on the individual , on triumphs and follies small and big . by the second half a sense of bittersweet fatalism creeps in ; of broken lives that never reached fulfillment choking with regret and yearning . `` it ca n't matter '' , seems like the world is saying , to which konchalovksy answers `` it must matter '' because the protagonists keep on trying for redemption . yet behind this saga of 'man against landscape ' something seems to hover , shadowy , almost substanceless , like the eternal old man hermit who appears in every segment to guide or repudiate the protagonists , sometimes a mere spectactor , sometimes the enigmatic sage ; a little behind and above all the other straightforward and logical incomprehensible ultimatums challenges and affirmations of the human characters , something invisible seems to lurk . ghosts of the fathers appearing in sepia dreams , repeated shots of a star gleaming in the nightsky , a curious bear , indeed the eternal old man himself ; konchalovksy calls for awe and reverence before a mystical land of some other order . in its treatment of a small backwoods community struggling against nature progress and time and in the ways it learns to deal with them , often funny bizarre and tragic at the same time , and in how the director never allows cynicism to override his humanism , it reminds me of shohei imamura 's the profound desires of the gods . when , in a dream scene , alexei tears through the planks of a door on which is plastered a propaganda poster of stalin to reach out at his ( dead ) father as he vanishes in the fog , the movie hints at the betrayal of the soviet dream , or better yet , at all the things lost in the revolution , this betrayal made more explicit in the film 's fiery denouement . the amazing visuals , elegiac and somber with a raw naturalist edge , help seal the deal . by the end of it , an oil derric erupts in flames and the movie erupts in a wild explosion of pure cinema .
i , like many die-hard trekkers ( or trekkies , i do n't care ! ) suffered through seven seasons of `` star trek voyager '' , dreaming of a better show when it was over , lamenting the end of `` deep space nine '' in 1999. prayers , answered . `` enterprise '' is fantastic . fresh perspective , radically different characters , stunning new visuals , a pop-song for the intro . ( i was shocked ! ) i ca n't think of anything i did n't like . sign me up for 10 seasons of this show . `` star trek '' is back - `` voyager , '' nobody misses you ! keep on trekkin ' ! >
this is a great story of family loyalty which , thankfully , does n't resort to the usual tricks ( or at least the ones i 'm used to seeing in american and european films ) of supersentimentality or high dramatic tension . it 's very watchable and very lovable . it has some beautiful cinematography , but does n't rely on that alone to entertain .
great documentary about the lives of ny firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time .. that reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item .. what shocked me was not only the attacks , but the '' high fat diet '' and physical appearance of some of these firefighters . i think a lot of doctors would agree with me that , in the physical shape they were in , some of these firefighters would not of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear . having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job . the french have a history of making great documentary 's and that is what this is , a great documentary .....
this movies chronicles the life and times of william castle . he made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s-1960s that he sold with gimmicks . in `` 13 ghosts '' you need viewers to see the ghosts ( they were in color , the film was in b & w ) . `` the tingler '' had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre . `` marabre '' issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death ! the movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them . in this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by castle , actors in his movies and his daughter . it also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was ( by all accounts he was a great guy ) . the documentary is affectionate , very funny and absolutely riveting . it 's very short ( under 90 minutes ) and there 's never a dull moment . a must see for castle fans and horror movie fans . my one complaint -- there were very few sequences shown from his pictures . that aside this is just great .
i recently rented this doc , having remembered hearing about it from imdb.com and being intrigued by the premise . i knew very little about either of these bands , but i do remember hearing `` not if you were the last junkie on earth '' by the dandy warhols ages ago and enjoying it . that being said , this is my perspective on the doc : one thing i found incredible about this film is there is no need to have any prior knowledge of either of these bands . the director ( ondi timoner ) wastes no time in engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people in this film . i quickly became grooved to the lives both anton and courtney as well as their respective bands , the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols . i think that is part of what makes this doc so good , and what makes ondi timoner such a master documentarian . i also loved how the `` story '' of these bands was told . most of what you see is of the bands on tour . both bands start out playing small venues and struggling to make it in the recording industry . throughout the film , each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm . however it is this that makes the two bands similar , and thus the brilliant perspective on how two bands of a feather can go in such different directions . i would basically recommend this for anyone who likes film in general . you do not need to have a particular love for documentaries , or either of the bands . an appreciation for music helps , but the music itself takes a backseat to the love/hate relationship between the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols .
netflix should mention this short feature on the info for silk stockings . superior in every way to that over-produced fluff . this had much better cole porter songs and lots more energy . silk stockings turned out to be a big disappointment . fred was getting too old for this sort of thing , though the dances and cyd are lovely . i will be on the watch for the garbo -- melvyn douglas version of ninotchka . was peter lorre ill during the making of silk stockings -- he seems to be very passive in the more active numbers and with less lines ? very glad that i ran across paree -- paree by pure accident . made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable . bob hope , as a simple `` song and dance man ' is pure joy .
following the brilliant `` goyôkiba '' ( aka . `` hanzo the razor - sword of justice '' , 1972 ) and its excellent ( and even sleazier ) sequel `` goyôkiba : kamisori hanzô jigoku zeme '' ( aka . `` razor 2 : the snare '' , 1973 ) , this `` goyôkiba : oni no hanzô yawahada koban '' aka . `` razor 3 : who 's got the gold '' is the third , and sadly final installment to the awesome saga about the incorruptible samurai-constable hanzo 'the razor ' ittami ( brilliantly played by the great shintarô katsu ) , who fights corruption with his fighting expertise as well as his enormous sexual powers . as a big fan of 70s exploitation cinema made in nippon , `` sword of justice '' became an instant favorite of mine , and i was therefore more than eager to find the sequels , and full of anticipation when i finally stumbled over them recently . while this third `` hanzo '' film is just not quite as brilliant as its predecessors it is definitely another great piece of cult-cinema that no lover of japanese exploitation cinema can afford to miss . `` who 's got the gold '' is a bit tamer than the two foregoing hanzo films , but it is just as brilliantly comical and crudely humorous , and immediately starts out fabulously odd : the film begins , when hanzo 's two assistants see a female ghost when fishing . having always wanted to sleep with a ghost , hanzo insists that his assistants lead him to the site of the occurrence ... if that is not a promising beginning for an awesome film experience , i do n't know what is . shintaro katsu , one of my personal favorite actors , is once again brilliant in the role of hanzo , a role that seems to have been written specifically for him . katsu is hanzo , the obstinate and fearless constable , who hates corruption and deliberately insults his superiors , and whose unique interrogation techniques include raping female suspects . the interrogated women than immediately fall for him , due to his sexual powers and enormous penis , which he trains in a rather grotesque routine ritual . i will not give away more about the plot in `` who 's got the gold '' , but i can assure that it is as cool as it sounds . the supporting performances are also very good , and , as in the predecessors , there are plenty of hilariously eccentric characters . this is sadly the last film in the awesomely sleazy 'hanzo ' series . if they had made 20 sequels more , i would have happily watched them all ! the entire hanzo series is brilliant , and while this third part is a bit inferior compared to its predecessors , it is definitely a must-see for all lovers of cult-cinema ! oh how i wish they had made more sequels !
i saw this film at a store in the cheap section . i actually vividly remembered seeing the commercials and trailer for it years ago . i thought `` what the hey ' and bought it , basically because the plot sounded interesting and claire danes has always been someone of talent in my eyes ( this was also before i became a huge kate beckinsale fan ) . so it 's about two girls who sneak off to a vacation in bangkok , get busted for narcotics ( which they are innocent of ) and then are sent to a thailand prison . the film follows what will happen to them and at times questions their innocence . both claire danes and kate beckinsale give great performances , and the plot of this film wraps itself up unconventionally , and raises some nice moral discussion questions . i think this is a solid good film , but there could have been some improvements . it could have been longer ... it would 've helped to solidify these characters and more insight into the politics of thailand 's justice system would 've helped . nevertheless , other than that , it 's a good film with some great performances . p.s . for all you pop-culture junkies be on the lookout for a two-minute role by paul walker . i did n't even notice him the first time i saw the film .
simply well written , directed and acted ... woody 's best of the 2000 's if not his best since the 80 's ! ! hugh jackman was the perfect pick for his roll . scarlett johansson 's banter with woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become . it 's refreshing to not being in a romance on screen with the leading lady . he plays the perfect bumbling magician . there have been a few reviews maligning this movie . do n't let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film . people in the crowd i saw this with were laughing so loud at some lines i missed the next line . if you like woody allen films of the 70 's , you 'll regret missing this one . i suggest you go to watch this film with an open mind , if you do , you might walk out smiling .
i first saw this back in the early 90s on uk tv , i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it , many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it tv again , the main thing that stuck with me was the end , the hole castle part really touched me , its easy to watch , has a great story , great music , the list goes on and on , its ok me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it , yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch , it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty , i am so glad it has came out on dvd as it is one of my top 10 films of all time . buy it or rent it just see it , best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you do n't have to stop the film . enjoy
at first , this movie seems so bad that i almost fell in a trance the first time i saw it.it was like a bad dream.a cosmic bore.but i gave it a second chance , then another and another , etc ... i finally got addicted to this film , due to it 's dreamlike slow pace , wonderful natural sets , bathed in a mellow autumn light and especially the musical score , which is made of some 70 's progressive rock and absolute exquisite folk songs by actor/singer/songwriter derek lamb ( the troubadour ) .you should notice the song about hazel wood , silver trout and lady vanishing in the air ... , heard in the middle and near the end of the film.there are some carnal scenes in the beginning , wich allow us to appreciate the natural charms of elizabeth suzuki.if that movie had been made by some `` repertoire '' directors like bergman , lars von triers or jean-luc goddard , critics would have rolled on the floor , raving about that movie as if it were a cosmic masterpiece.i personally think this film is one million times superior to any of fellini 's cinematic sh # ¤ @ t ! definitely not for the pretentious .
i got to say that uma thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet . this movie was uber cute and i mean uber cute . it had all the `` sex '' content that most ivan reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra , chemistry . uma and luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene . both seem to create this odd , twisted and interesting relationship with powerful `` sexual '' tension that you laugh until you ca n't feel your face anymore . anna farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other 's roles perfectly and even wanda sykes ' rather small role will keep you laughing . though these kind of comedies are n't for everybody , but i have to say i went with a person that does n't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy . this movie is certainly not for everyone . especially younger children since some moments are little too ... well lets say adult for younger viewers . all in all i was pleasantly surprised by this movie , tough the ending i found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film . ( 3 1/2 * out of 5 * )
during a kurt weill celebration in brooklyn , where do we go from here ? was finally unearthed for a screening . it is amazing that a motion picture , from any era , that has weill-gershwin collaborations can possibly be missing from the screens . the score stands tall , and a cd of the material , with gershwin and weill , only underscores its merits , which are considerable . yes , the film has its problems , but the score is not one of them . ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy , and fred macmurray can not quite grasp the material . then , too , the 'modern ' segment is weakly written . but the fantasy elements carry the film to a high mark , as does the work of the two delightful leading ladies - joan leslie and june haver . both have the charm that this kind of work desperately needs to work . as a world war ii salute to our country 's history - albeit in a 'never was ' framework , the film has its place in hollywood musical history and should be available for all to see and to find its considerable merits .
ahh , talespin ! what can i say that has n't already been said about this great show ? nothing ! this is without a doubt one of the most well-written shows i 've ever encountered , live-action or animation . the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes , and some of the `` mature '' stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for . but not talespin . the stories are engaging and very plausible . some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie . episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike . then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you , where the emphasis is on hilarity . i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones . the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays ( at least , those which are n't specifically geared toward it ) , especially in cartoons . in the episode stormy weather for instance , kit cloudkicker decides that he 's going to join an air circus , but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous . in the biggest fight of the episode , baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan , to which kit screams `` no ! you ca n't tell me what to do ! your 're * not * * my * * dad * ! '' and buries his face in his pillow . the next day he leaves for the air circus . this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon , and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays . the characters have a lot of depth to them . baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book , plus or minus a few degrees of laziness . rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money , while good in theory , are seldom good in practice . molly is a cute little girl , but you ca n't let that deceive you . she can be a real hellion sometimes . kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest . he does n't trust adults much unless they appeal to him , and he has a tendency to break off relationships . watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook : he looks as though he 's prepared to put it right through a pirate . in the end , it 's the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show # 1 in my book . the relationship between baloo and kit is very real , almost father and son . this is demonstrated well in all 's whale that ends whale when baloo takes kit 's word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults . baloo and becky 's relationship is also realistic , due to baloo 's motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol ' sea duck , not necessarily a desire to help rebecca . but something tells me that if he did get the duck back he 'd still do jobs for rebecca . the sea duck , not to mention all the other planes in the series , is pretty realistically designed . the plane 's functions do n't change once throughout the series ( continuity like that is hard to come by also ) , and unlike most other `` super-planes '' of other cartoons , it does n't have one single weapon on board ( unless you count mangoes ! ) , and relies instead on it 's cunning pilot 's great skill to get out of trouble . it 's hard to think of a hero vehicle that does n't have some sort of gun turret , laser cannon , or even a handgun somewhere on board . and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays . plus it 's just such a darn cool design ! this is definitely the best cartoon . ever . period . definitely worth all ten stars !
i love this film 'spring and port wine ' . i was born in leigh , a town about 7 miles away from bolton , i moved to bolton in 1965 when i was 20 . my place of work was daily via little lever through farnworth , sometimes on a bike but then by car when i could afford it.the film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always broke but who would always help you if they could . fred dibnah was round the corner from bromwich st. were my bedsit was . if you did n't see the film when first released then you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap such as coronation st , well i agree it is a soap , but then , it was called 'kitchen sink drama ! ' watch this film for the talented cast who shortly afterwards became household names from frequent roles on tv , i watch mainly for the shots of the locality and the feel good factor of people being poor but happy !
i was all ready to pan this episode , seeing that this 'master ' really does n't have any horror films under his belt .. but this is easily the best episode of the season . the acting was good ! ! i do n't know how he wrangled it , but we 've got some real talent in this episode ! and while you could see things coming from a mile away plot wise , at least it was entertaining and managed to keep me engaged for the full 56 mins , something that has been lacking up to this point in the series . i especially liked the bit at the end , not a twist per say , but just a funny little bit where he becomes , as ever , the hen-pecked hubby . really good effort . like i 've said in other reviews- these are not true masters doing a lot of these episodes .. but they may someday end up being masters in the future .
i liked this movie because it basically did more with less . it could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more ( though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop ) . the guy playing the dj did a good job of showing someone spooked out and haunted by his memories . i also found his dialog with the callers pretty funny . while parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away , other parts you do not expect to turn out the way they did . i thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part , concentrating more on the living side of the equation . the last 5-10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is being revealed . while it was a shorter movie , it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story . any more and it would have started to drag .
i was very moved by the story and because i am going through something similar with my own parents , i really connected . it is so easy to forget that someone whose body is failing was once vibrant and passionate . and then there 's the mistakes they made and have to live with . i loved ellen burstyn 's performance and who is christine horne ? she 's fantastic ! a real find . there is probably the most erotic scene i 've ever seen in a film , yet nothing was shown - it was just so beautifully done . overall the look and feel of the film was stunning , a real emotional journey . cole hauser is very very good in this picture , he humanizes a man spiraling downwards . i liked the way the filmmaker approached this woman 's life , never sentimental , never too much - just enough to hook us in , but not enough to bog down .
i always have a bit of distrust before watching the british period films because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays ( such as the ones of , for example , vanity fair or the other boleyn girl ) , but with a magnificent production design , european landscapes and those thick british accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really have.fortunately , the excellent film the young victoria does not fall on that situation , and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story , the excellent performances from emily blunt , paul bettany and jim broadbent , and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the view.and i say `` unexpectedly '' because i usually do not pay too much attention to those details . `` victorian era '' was ( in my humble opinion ) one of the key points in contemporary civilization , and not only on the social aspect , but also in the scientific , artistic and cultural ones.but i honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much , and maybe because of that i enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so much.i also liked the way in which queen victoria is portrayed , which is as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good , but they were at least inspired by good intentions.i also found the depiction of the romance between victoria and prince albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the emotions it evokes.the only fail i found on this movie is that screenwriter julian fellowes used some clichés of the romantic cinema on the love story , something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplay . i liked the young victoria very much , and i really took a very nice surprise with it.i hope more period films follow the example of this movie : the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story , and not as the replacement of it .
in joel schumacher , you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time . but this is common knowledge ; i think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time , failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur . hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror/thriller ; chaplin liked his comedy ; scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and spielberg likes his large scale , big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids . other more obscure examples include kubrick and welles who covered too much to write about here . but schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise . falling down had a great idea behind it but i found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy . batman is a superhero ; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me . then comes 8mm ; a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before tigerland which is schumacher 's best film from what i 've so far seen , in my opinion . with the war genre , laughter is n't something you 'd associate with it for most of the time . i can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the d-day landings during saving private ryan : at the time when i first saw the film , i had not much knowledge of the second world war bar when it began and finished . my eyebrows were up , my mouth slightly open with a weak ' i ca n't believe it smile ' on my face . needless to say , it was because of that film i searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole . in tigerland , you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through bozz ( farrell ) , a tough and egotistical soldier training for the vietnam war . but what 's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction ; just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time . the things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school . tigerland may borrow from full metal jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the vietnam war but egos and superegos play more of a part here , i think . the superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against bozz whose ego is extremely large . there is also the third part of freud 's triangle that sneaks into bozz : the id . compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos , bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he should n't do to float to the surface and express itself : `` you are all dead in this situation ! '' barks a sergeant . `` any questions ? '' `` yeah , if i 'm dead how come i can ask a question ? '' replies bozz whose punishments such as push-ups and dirt eating seem to un-faze him in true id style ; that is he enjoys the punishments . also regarding the superegos , bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training . this is something the existing captain of the squad can not do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell bozz he is in charge . what follows is an actual conversation between bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his christian name . this is where private wilson 's ( whigham ) character steps in : his uncontrollable rage and anger at bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film 's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river . wilson can not control his impulses and dislike toward bozz and acts out . what i also liked about tigerland is that it 's shot in such a way that is brave . while lacking in innovation , tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look . make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness . but , we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for tv ; the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but schumacher is clever : he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film 's budget could 've been half of what it was . it 's worth saying here that spielberg said he wanted saving private ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes . while being very funny and entertaining , tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick ; not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute . its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he can not even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier . there are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy , if not unhappy ending that 'll open your mind and make you think about what it 's perhaps really like in the military .
this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever , and may be one of the best movies ever ... it 's got a great plot that functions like a puzzle , with lots of intrigue and suspense . this film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions , with people hiding their identities and their natures . the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters . they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality 's and desires . the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting . it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy . there are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal . the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film ... when this happens , the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel . these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely . one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death . the director chang cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death . this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective . we actually care when people are killed in this film . this is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed . some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching . when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain . at the same time , this is also a fun movie . it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film . there is bad dubbing , the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat . some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic ... all this just adds to the greatness of the film . and lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries . if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic . everything goes by so fast ( because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre ) that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is . the lighting and composition are spectacular at times . the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing ... in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example , imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed . chang cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it 's confines . he does n't rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film , but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work . he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people . this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level . it 's art , it 's trash , it 's emotionally moving , and it 's fun , it has a true sense of morality , but does n't allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action . i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not .
a trio of buddies , sergeants all in the british army , carouse & brawl their way across imperial india . intensely loyal to each other , they meet their greatest & most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult & its demented , implacable guru . now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment , the water carrier gunga din , to save scores of the queen 's soldiers from certain massacre . based more on the three musketeers than kipling 's classic poem , this is a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry in hollywood 's golden year of 1939 . filled with suspense & humor , while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum , it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the ( sentimental ) conclusion . it is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars , cary grant , victor mclaglen & douglas fairbanks jr. , as they are really all thirds of a single organism - inseparable and , to all intents & purposes , indistinguishable . however , this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time . ( it 's interesting to note , parenthetically , that mclaglen boasted of a distinguished world war one military career ; fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two - mostly in clandestine affairs & earning himself no fewer than 4 honorary knighthoods after the conflict ; while grant reportedly worked undercover for british intelligence , keeping an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizers . ) the real acting laurels here should go to sam jaffe , heartbreaking in the title role . he infuses the humble man with radiant dignity & enormous courage , making the last line of kipling 's poem ring true . he is unforgettable . montague love is properly stalwart as the regimental major , whilst eduardo ciannelli is evil incarnate as the thuggee guru . the rest of the cast , joan fontaine , robert coote , lumsden hare , are effective but have little to do . movie mavens will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaine 's father . the film picks its villains well . the demonic thuggee cult , worshipers of the hideous , blood-soaked kali , hindu goddess of destruction , was the bane of indian life for 6 centuries , ritualistically strangling up to 30,000 victims a year . in 1840 the british military , in cooperation with a number of princely states , succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion . henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels & nightmares .
when it comes to paul verhoeven and erotic thrillers , most people think of `` basic instinct '' and some maybe of `` showgirls '' . but verhoeven has made his best erotic thriller years before these two movies : `` de vierde man '' . this film is mesmerizing and mindblowing - and above all the story is absolutely plausible , which makes the whole experience even more intense . the performances by jeroen krabbe , renee soutendijk and thom hoffman are exceptional , and verhoeven 's direction does the rest . `` de vierde man '' makes even `` basic instinct '' look quite tame ... it ca n't get much better than this , a true classic of erotic nightmare cinema . 10 out of 10 , at least ...
sergio martino is a great director , who has contributed a lot to italian genre cinema and , as far as i am considered , his gialli from the 1970s are the undisputed highlights in his impressive repertoire . `` la coda dello scorpione '' aka . `` the case of the scorpion 's tale '' of 1971 is one of these impressive films martino has contributed to italian horror 's most original sub-genre , and another proof that the man is a master of atmosphere , style and suspense . my personal favorite of the martino films i 've seen so far is still the insanely brilliant `` your vice is a locked room and only i have the key '' of 1972 , followed by `` torso '' ( 1973 ) and `` the strange vice of mrs wardh '' ( 1971 ) , all of which i personally like even more than this one . that 's purely a matter of personal taste , however , as `` la coda dello scorpione '' is an equally excellent film that is essential for every fan of italian horror cinema and suspense in general . the film , which delivers tantalizing suspense from the very beginning has a complex and gripping plot that begins with the mysterious demise of a millionaire who has died in a plane crash . insurance investigator peter lynch ( george hilton ) is assigned to verify the circumstances the insurance company which is due to pay a large sum to the deceased man 's wife . soon after lynch begins to investigate , a person is brutally killed , which is just the beginning of a series of murders ... `` the case of the scorpion 's tail '' excellently delivers all the elements a great giallo needs . the film is stunningly suspenseful from the beginning , the score by bruno nicolai is brilliant , the plot is wonderfully convoluted , and the killer 's identity remains a mystery until the end . regular giallo leading-man george hilton once again delivers an excellent performance in the lead . sexy anita strindberg is absolutely ravishing in the female lead . the includes the great luigi pistilli , one of the most brilliant regulars of italian genre-cinema of the 60s and 70s , and alberto de mendoza , another great actor who should be familiar to any lover of italian cinema . athens , where most of the film takes place , is actually a great setting for a giallo . the atmosphere is constantly gripping , and the photography great , and bruno nicolai 's ingenious score makes the suspense even more intense . long story short : `` la coda dello scorpione '' is another excellent giallo from sergio martino and an absolute must-see for any lover of the sub-genre ! stylish , suspenseful , and great in all regards !
fay grim is a true example of what i call a completed puzzle film . it has all the pieces of acting , direction , storyline , and entertainment value . they all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece , fay grim . this film follows a single mother fay grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing . soon the cia contacts fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband henry 's . these journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the cia and his involvement with countries and their government doings . fay is sent to find these journals , in return to release her brother from prison , and is sent on a cat-and-mouse chase all over europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew about . parker posey had already been an actress i liked after i watched her in the oh in ohio and best in show . she brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers , but fay grim was a far different role than the other two movies . posey made me believe what was happening on screen , i felt for her , i rooted for her , and i wanted to know more . she grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you ca n't stop thinking about what is happening to her . i have n't seen any other previous works by writer/director hal hartley but i believe i will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as fay grim was . if you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a dvd i 'd highly urge you to choose fay grim . if you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely .
everybody 's got bills to pay , and that includes christopher walken . in vietnam , a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of pows , including christopher walken . following a mad max 3 ( ! ) thunderdome fight , and a short massacre later . walken and some colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other . cut to the present ( 1991 ) , and colombian guy is leading a revolution against el presidente . he 's successful at first , but after el presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank , he 's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television . this is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on american telly , which leads walken to assemble the old squad ( even though he was n't actually part of that squad to begin with ) , in order to invade colombia and gun down thousands of people . mcbain is a monumentally stupid film , but for all that it 's also a good laugh , and action packed too . this is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression , or even breaking a window ? also , it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in new york without the police bothering . there 's plenty of b-movie madness to chew on here , from michael ironside 's diabolical acting in the vietnam sequence , to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes , to the side splitting confrontation between walken and el presidente , and let 's not forget the impassioned speech by the sister of the rebel leader , being watched on television in america ( nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye , that bit ) . it 's out there for a quid . buy it if you have a sense of humour . see how many times you can spot the camera crew too .
for me , this is one of the best movies i ever saw.overcoming racism , struggling through life and proving himself he is n't just an ordinary `` cookie '' , carl brashear is an amazing character to play , who puts cuba in his best light , best performance in his life.de niro , who is a living legend gives that something to the movie.hated his character in movie , but he gives so much good acting to this film , great performance.and appearance of beautiful charlize was and as always is a big plus for every movie . so if you have n't seen this movie i highly recommended for those who love bravery , greatness who seek inspiration.you must look this great drama . my vote 9/10 .
i have to admit , this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in tears . however , i always think about things twice , and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable , i prefer taking the risk of a closer look . first what 's first : the movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow-paced movie that does n't try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 9/11 . thumbs up for this stroke of genius , because , unlike stone 's world trade center this film fortunately does n't focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which , similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion , is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating . the psychological impact , the sheer devastation that 9/11 caused and the havoc it wreaked on the american people is almost palpable in this movie . i think binder managed an astute observation of the american post 9/11 society and sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an oscar . however : in the film blood diamond , the di caprio character says and i quote : `` ah , these americans . always want to take about their feelings '' . now , i do n't want to belittle their sufferíngs , but i sure would like to make a comparison . ever since 9/11 the entire world is confronted with mementos , memorials and commemorations of 9/11 . the hollywood industry and writers such as safran foer more than allude to 9/11 in their works . now , this huge amount of cultural products , dealing with 9/11 , turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century . the number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject , and i say this with all due respect , blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportion . fact is : people die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people . we have a war in iraq , in afghanistan , in birma and lots of other countries . on a daily basis , we forget about the poverty the african people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the american victims of 9/11 simply because they are black and because their lives do n't have much in common with our western lives . africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way america can . so , what i am saying is this : the reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9/11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11 . not a day goes by without a newspaper article , a film or a book that discusses 9/11 . in conclusion : i commiserated with charlie fineman , but i was n't sure whether i had the right to feel for him more than for a hutu who lost his entire family in the rwandan civil war . you catch my thrift ?
the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast . a ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it . but this movie caught me off guard . it was n't what i was expecting at all . it 's been a while since i 've seen it but i do remember i could not stop laughing ! ! ! and it was n't just the cast that did it for me . the script was amazingly written . every time you were expecting something to happen it did n't happen . there were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious . the cinematography , along with the set , was absolutely beautiful as well . i really ca n't say anything bad about this movie ! expcept , i would have andrew davoli a little more screen time !
i expected something different : more passion , drama ... again another failed attempt of originality.i 'm sorry to say that the film falls into the old cliché of 'cheesiness'.15 year old teens may appreciate it though.the acting was not very convincing and the lines common , lacking any wit.still , the soundtrack was good and well adapted.i ca n't say that this movie is a total flop , because people do watch it but it did n't meet the public 's expectations and sunk into mediocrity.so , to conclude , the production keeps you in front of the tv for almost an hour and a half , which is an appreciable thing.thus , i guess its worth seeing if you do n't get annoyed
the movie `` holly '' is the story of a young girl who has been sold by her poor family and smuggled across the border to cambodia to work as a prostitute in the infamous `` k11 '' red light village . in the movie , holly is waiting to be sold at a premium for her virginity when she meets patrick who is losing money and friends through gambling and bar fights . patrick and holly have an immediate bond over their `` stubbornness '' , but this is all disrupted when holly is sold to a child trafficker and disappears . as movie goers , we are then thrust into patrick 's pursuit to find holly again . holly then shows her willingness to leave this lifestyle but her confusion on what is right and wrong . `` holly '' carries us through the beautiful and harsh cambodia while discovering that holly is not just one girl . she is the voice of millions of children who are exploited and violated every year with no rights or protection . holly is less extreme than its subject matter might suggest , such as documentaries that involve 4-year olds and sexual trafficking , but does manage to shed considerable light on cambodian / vietnamese trafficking of children into prostitution . it is a moving story that helps to shed light on the horrible situation in which many children face and their struggles to trust and realize what is right and wrong . patrick , the antagonist of the film is an american dealer of stolen artifacts who is also losing money and friends while playing cards and getting into bar fights . while on a journey , his motorbike runs out of fuel , and he is forced to rent a room at a brothel . during his stay he comes across holly , a twelve year old girl who has been sold by her parents and is being abducted into slavery and prostitution . holly and patrick begin a friendship of trust and understanding . he discovers a clever , stubborn girl beneath the traumatized exterior and becomes determined to save her -- though their strictly platonic relationship is misinterpreted by almost everyone they meet . when she suddenly disappears , he starts a journey to track her down , without having thought if he can really help her . holly is able to escape on her way to another brothel , when she jumps from the truck and runs into a field filled with mines . a mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead , so holly is then left on her own . during patrick 's journey to find holly he meets a social worker who tries to talk some sense into him and shares the facts with him that haunts the cambodian region . the idea of paying for her freedom simply fuels the demand , she explains : 30,000 children in prostitution in cambodia - next year it could be 60,000 . `` i 'm not trying to save 60,000 , '' he tells her , `` i 'm trying to save one . '' patrick discovers that the idea of whisking her to safety is quickly put to rest when the social worker tells him that the us will not let him adopt and , although it takes five minutes to 'save ' a child , it takes five years to reintegrate her into society . patrick is not affected by the information and he continues his quest to find holly . the audience is then shown that holly makes it to a small town and is foraging for food with other homeless children . she is then befriended by a local policemen who seem little better than criminals with a badge , when they sell her to another brothel and then make a deal to a vietnamese businessman who then takes her virginity . holly then seems to think that this is her destiny and when patrick finally find her , she is willing to `` yum yum '' and `` boom boom '' her distant friend . patrick is utterly confused by this change in behavior , but he is not deterred in his plan to take her away from this world . in the end , he steals her away and brings her to a safe-land in the comfort of the social worker . holly is given fresh clothes , if feed and brought to a dance class , but she is forbidden to see patrick . this intense yearning to be in the comfort of patrick 's friendship , she runs away from the safe house and back onto the streets in cambodia . meanwhile , patrick is dealing with the decision to leave the country and flee back to the united states or to stay in cambodia . his thoughts continue to revert back to holly and during a visit to a bar ; an older male sees the picture he is holding and comments on his sexual appetite when he had sex with her . this enrages patrick and he hits the man and runs out of the bar . eventually , patrick is caught by the police in the eyes of holly , who is hiding behind a pole . the movie `` holly '' may make the audience want to donate money towards organizations that improve the life for these poor youngsters , and even campaign to reduce the amount of brothels in the region , but the film 's dramatic weaknesses may reduce its chances of being seen by enough people to make a difference . overall , i think the concept is better as a documentary and it was not as touching as a movie . the actors did a great job of showing their raw emotion and the true confusion of the youngsters who are affected by this lifestyle , but in the end , the harsh lifestyle of the region and the desperate notions of the parents who sell their children to uphold their own starvation , does nothing to help the children 's situations .
you got to go and dig those holes . holes only leaves troble , which makes a movie so good . disney has done it again.shia labeouf should be nominated for best actor for his performance as stanley yelnats . he has alredy won the daytime emmy for best actor in a comedy series ( even stevens ) . holes is one of the best movies in 2003 .
an our gang comedy short . the gang coerces spanky into watching their younger siblings . caring for these forgotten babies turns out to be quite a chore , leaving the little nipper with no choice but to come up with some ingenious solutions to the baby-sitting problem ... spanky is in his glory in this hilarious little film , arguably his best . highlight : spanky 's retelling the plot of the tarzan movie he 's recently seen to the audience of infants . movie mavens will recognize billy gilbert 's voice in the radio drama .
i really liked the first 2 seasons . because a lot of good characters disappeared later on . like most shows are kinda slow at first then get better in later seasons , but this is the absolute reverse . jenny from the 1st season and valarie from the 2nd season were sabrina 's friends , i really did n't care for the others , jenny and valarie were her coolest friends . i think for some reason , the producers wanted us to not like her college friends for some reason , they were so cruel to sabrina . but my favorite episode from season 1 is cat showdown and my favorite episode from season 2 is witch trash , that is the funniest episode . i also thought it was funny how libby was popular but she was always jealous of sabrina , and never seemed to have a real boyfriend but was always wanting to be with harvey . i just wished they could have made more better ones . i also liked how the first 2 seasons , during the opening credits sabrina would say a few words while wearing a costume , like in the pilot episode where she 's in the witch costume , i liked how she said `` this is so not me '' and later on she kept trying to change herself to something else is what i think , but this is a really cool show . it is kinda like the andy griffith show in a way because it good at first but once it turned color and barney fife left , it was longer good . but i still like to watch it , but the only reason i watch later seasons is because of sabrina . what i meant about the opening sequence is : the opening titles of seasons 1-3 shows sabrina in front of a mirror posing with several different costumes and outfits as the cast members ' names quickly flash on the bottom of the screen . at the end , sabrina would say some sort of pun that related to the outfit she is wearing , then disappear . the opening sequence of season four includes the characters in bubbles . the opening credits of seasons 5-7 features sabrina at various locations around boston
a have a female friend who is currently being drawn into a relationship with an sob who has a long term girlfriend . of course the sob is very good-looking , charming , etc and my friend is a very intelligent woman . watching jean pierre leaud 's character at work is exactly like watching what goes on in real life when guys like that destroy the lives of our female friends . it 's tragic , and you know she 's going to end up very hurt , but there 's nothing you can do . leaud is brilliant . totally empty . a blank throughout , he pulls the faces and tells the stories he thinks will get the reaction he wants . the scene two hours in when leaud and lebrun have made love , and the next morning he puts on a record and , very sweetly and charmingly , sings along to amuse her is brilliant . the `` what the hell am i doing here with this idiot '' expression that flickers back and forth across her face will be in my memory for a long time to come . it 's a long film , but see it in one go , preferably in a cinema . takes a while to get into , but then the time just disappears .
this movie stars jay leno as a detroit cop , tony costas and pat morita as a tokyo cop sent to detroit to retrieve a stolen prototype of a car motor . a japanese man traveled to detroit hoping to sell it to a up and coming car company ran by a man named derrick jarryd . unfortunately for him the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype . an angry derek jarryd tries to distance himself from phillip madras who led the men . but madras ( played by chris sarandon ) has none of it and threatens jarryd forcing him to continue their partnership . meanwhile in the same junk yard where the japanese man had been killed , a friend of tony costas was also killed by the same men . tony 's friend had been watching the junk yard . tony sets out to find the killer against his superior 's order . tony is on robbery while obviously homicide should investigate the case . while tony is investigating the crime he runs into the japanese cop and mistakingly he arrests him . eventually they end up working together on the case . they make an odd pair and there are some genuinely amusing parts as well as some ridiculous scenes such as pat morita jumping and kicking right through a the windshield of a moving car and kicking madras in the head . but it ends up being an enjoyable buddy cop movie , at least in my opinion . jay leno is no actor , but he is likable in the role and pat morita is good as well . still , they make for one of the more unlikely buddy cop duos in an action film . if you liked buddy cop films , cheesy 80 's movies or you want to see jay leno as an actor then i recommend this movie .
i do n't see how you can say that freddy 's nightmares is cheesy and a rip-off . you obviously do n't know good tv when you see it . the episodes are packed with drama and blood . freddy is creative in the way he kills people . i love freddy 's nightmares and i hope to get all 44 episodes on dvd . the best episodes are : saturday night special , school daze , and love stinks . if you think this series sucked then you 're entitled to your opinion but remember it 's only your opinion and it means nothing . freddy 's nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and you 'll come to accept that fact soon enough . if you do n't like it then do n't watch it but do n't deny it 's brilliance .
initially , i would have thought that secret sunshine had something critical to say of religion ( and here being christianity ) , and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith , or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou . surprisingly , it was none of the sort and was largely non-judgemental , putting in place events as a matter of fact , and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusion . and i ca n't help but to chuckle at the role of song kang-ho , a man who 's taken a liking for widower shin-ae ( jeong do-yeon ) , and starts going to church when she does . the reasons for church going are many i suppose , either to find inner peace , to seek help , being afraid of eternal damnation in the fires of hell , to reaffirm faith , or even things like wanting to get married in a church , or to skirt chase ( i kid you not ) . but to each his own reasons for turning up in church every sunday and participating in prayer groups for fellowship , what is indeed dangerous , is when the underlying ulterior motives , do not get satisfied , and that 's when frustration sets in . or when you discover how hypocritical man can be , portraying one face inside the house of god , and displaying yet another outside . shin-ae and her son jun moves to the town of miryang , which is the birthplace of her deceased husband . wanting to start life anew , she opens up a piano shop to give lessons , though in discovering her new found freedom and in a moment 's lack of good judgement , has another tragedy befall her . and that takes one hour to get to . secret sunshine really took its time to get to this point , where things then begin to get slightly more interesting with shin-ae now taking to embracing religion to deal with and accept her current state , reveling in the comfort that religion , and fellow believers , can offer . what began as crying out for sympathy turns into acceptance and belief that religion offers that silver bullet to solve the ills of all mankind , and sometimes you wonder if it 's because of your personal myopic view of what the almighty is doing for you , that you begin to adopt a somewhat selfish opinion that everything 's good going your way , and in shin-ae 's case , her magnanimous attitude in wanting to forgive others who had trespassed against her , forgetting something very fundamental that it the feeling can cut both ways too . the last act is probably the most fun of the lot as it says plenty , where most of us can identify with - why me , and why not someone else , as we rage against our faith and start questioning , unfortunately , with no hard and fast answers available . it is then either we fall by the wayside , or continue with destructive deeds so rebelliously . but somehow the plug gets carefully pulled in secret sunshine so as not to offend , and what could have been an ugly character mouthpiece , got muted . if you bite into the hype this movie is generating , then perhaps you 'll realize only jeong do- yeon 's excellent portrayal is worth mentioning , as she totally owns her role as the widow shin-ae who is probably the most unluckiest person on earth in having to deal with that many tragedies over a short period of time , and if you look at it carefully , most of which are of her own doing . watching her transformation , is worth the ticket price , and despite having my personal favourite korean actor song kang-ho in the movie , this is something he just breezed right through .
it 's hard to rate films like this , because do you rate it on production or just fun ? i saw this film back in about 1988/89 or so when i was a boy and i 'm sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas . the plot is fairly dire and the acting is of course terrible , but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninjas in this film which makes for quite a good atmosphere . what is important are the fight scenes , while a 'little ' sparce , are really good . i must say it was better when i was a boy , only now can i see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film , but as a `` sit back with a few beers '' martial arts film i ca n't fault it , it delivers and is much better than the mountains of `` american ninja '' style rubbish that was churned out in the 80 's with hundreds of guys in black suits but really not very good fight scenes . in an interesting note , dusty nelson , the writer and director of sakura killers did another ninja film under the bonaire movie flag called `` white phantom '' i have no idea if this was meant to be a sequel to sakura killers '' but the sakura clan is once again a main feature , including the same logo and similar story only this time including a white ninja . this too , while being mostly dire , had a small sense of atmosphere but the fight scenes are even more sparce and to be frank , are pretty awful . so , if you are a martial arts fan then give it a blast to kill a few hours !
a great gangster film.sam mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father-son camaraderie.brilliant star-cast leading with tom hanks ( michael sullivan ) has done a terrific job.great acting by him again.he is an acting legend.great acting too from paul newman , jude law and daniel craig.casting is just too good.the plot is quite good.you will enjoy the movie.a great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's.set in the 1930 's , this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era.soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie.a great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son.way underrated for my liking.deserved a fully deserved 10 .
when i first saw this film in the 1980 's , i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the `` sesame street/muppets '' age . i honestly do n't remember if i liked it at the time or not . however , somewhere in college i watched this film again , and it wound up going ( and staying ) into my personal best films ever collection . this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets . i mean , obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there 's humor geared towards both generations . but come on ... janice is accidentally overheard telling someone `` i do n't take my clothes off for anyone , even if it is artistic '' ... there 's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father does n't want to hear it ... gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation ( sp ? ) and afterwards says `` i think we 're engaged now '' ... these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling . add to that very smart dialogue , very smart new york/broadway `` wink wink '' humor , the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that do n't border on `` kid-level cheesy '' whatsoever ... this film is a masterpiece ! i do n't throw `` 10 '' 's out on a regular basis ... but this one deserves it . over 20 years later , this film totally holds up , perhaps even more so . the muppets never were and never will be again , as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is . -- -q
i have loved this movie all of my life . it 's such an intelligent story also , with plenty of classical allusions . eg . the ship that went missing decades earlier was called the bellerophon . well , in classical mythology this was the man who slew the chimera , a legendary beast composed of two or more other creatures . in fp , walter pidgeon is clearly the chimera- himself and his id monster . i like movies where the writers have clearly credited their audiences with a modicum of intelligence , unlike most modern blockbusters which spend $ 150m on special effects , but about $ 1.50 on a screenplay . cheers
a lot of the user comments i have seen on the imdb for this movie do n't really do it justice . first of all , let me just say that this movie is not to be taken seriously . it 's supposed to be a fun , yet stupid movie , that does n't require one to think , only to enjoy it . if you watch this movie with the intent to see a masterpiece in either filmmaking or in humour , then you will be sorely disappointed . yet , if you want to just watch a goofy movie with some talented actors/actresses , and some good catch-phrases , then you will enjoy it .
the first thing i have to say is that i own jake speed . i 've seen it at least 10 times . this movie is one of the most fun movies ever made . the film begins with margaret ( karen kopins ) trying to find her sister . her sister was kidnapped in paris and the family has heard nothing . along comes jake speed ( wayne crawford ) , telling her exactly where her sister is and making an offer to find her . jake speed is a hero . he does n't work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure . his partner ( dennis christopher ) follows him around and writes their adventures into novels . this film is a great adventure . it 's hilarious , it 's action-packed , it 's just great . i guess it 's a cult film with a very small cult following . crawford is perfect as jake speed and throws out some one-liners that you 'll never forget . kopins and christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick , respectively . john hurt , the guy who 's stomach blew up in alien , plays the devilish , pervertish villian which just adds to the fun . in many ways , this film is similar to indiana jones , in some ways it 's similar to james bond films . maybe it should have been called indiana bond but whatever it 's title is , it 's a very enjoyable film .
the perfect space fantasy film . a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down , but do they , sure they do.this would not be a family film if they all died . then it will all be sad . you do n't want that kate capsaw , the leading lady gives a golden globe performance , but sadly , she nor lea thompson won one . that sucks so bad.i ca n't say it enough , this film is so great , lea thompson- o lord , a perfect girl for this film . this film is the best for sure . sorry , but better than star wars . star wars is so over- rated and space camp was so under- rated . it should of been the other way around excellent 10/10- 0r maybe 11/10 . iam not good at math
the movie held my interest , mainly because dianne keaton is my favorite actress . i disagree with some of the other posts on the grounds that the plot was not convoluted . i had no trouble following it ( maybe some people had too much eggnog the night before ) . the movie was very sad and touching as well . what more do you want ? alexa davalos is a fine new talent ( beautiful too ) , and tom everett scott does an excellent job with his part as well . the relationship of the mother and daughter may have been a bit unrealistic , but the behavior of the young people in the movie was not . it was tragically sad but enlightening . it sure beat the other shows that were on tv new years day evening
a young solicitor in sent to a remote area to wrap up the estate of a recently deceased client . when he arrives he finds that he is made less than welcome by the local villagers and that his deceased client was not liked . to speed things up he decides to move from the local inn and take up residence in her home , a house that is usually fogbound and approached only by a causeway that is blocked off by the sea most of the day . once there he sees visions of a woman in black , is she real or imaginary , he is also subjected to the blood curdling cries of a woamn and child apparently drowning in the marshes , these events take their toll on him and he soon becomes quite terrified . atmospheric tv adaptation of a famous play by susan hill , that spends it first third building up its characters , before moving to the creepy country house , its poor colour contrast give away its tv roots immediately , this really should have been in black & white , but still as a ghost story it had a couple of unsettling moments , still though after waiting so long to see it i must say i was sadly just a little underwhelmed .
what 's good about it : some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan . does n't rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its `` gotcha '' moments . even if you 've seen everything , there 's still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop . what could have been better about it : the acting was , at times , flat and unconvincing . it had a `` shot-on-video '' quality in some places ( though , it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for ) , and the camera work is full of needless close-ups of meaningless actions . though the effects are genuinely creepy , i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them . the ending seemed rushed , and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments . the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves , not as a challenge by the filmmakers , but because they just missed it . still , a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average . well worth the rental .
huge , exhaustive and passionate summary of american cinema as seen through the eyes of martin scorcese . needless to say , there is never a dull moment in all of its 4 hour running time . many genres , periods and directors are all examined , discussed more from the perspective of cinephile rather than contemporary director . for anyone even remotely interested in american films , or cinema in general . a masterpiece , and the best of the bfi 's century of cinema series .
of those comments here before mine , i mostly agree with edyarb 's . the story and the script apparently had potential to be funny , but though managing at some points , in other places it failed . you could see them wanting to make a joke , but no one in the audience laughed . ( also agree with edyarb 's view on the end credits : leave it normal or make it cool , but not what they 've done now . ) ok , that gives a more negative feeling than what i actually had watching the movie . i enjoyed it ; it was pleasant entertainment for a night and definitely did n't feel like a waste of money to get the ticket . the best jokes are the ones that go a little bit outside of the expected and are fairly mature , like luke wilson 's character matt asking the super chick `` p * nis or bed ? '' when she told him she 'd `` get him a new one '' after a wild night in bed , ending up breaking the bed and leaving matt sore . i can not , however , agree with bgs1614 , who says that the film could earn an ' r ' rating - there was absolutely nothing in the film to justify that . some sexual acts yes , but nothing explicit , only humorous , and no nudity whatsoever . ( maybe he was at a prescreening that showed more ... ? ) i 'd like to compare this to two recent films i went to see with no expectations whatsoever : superman returns and click . i did n't really expect anything from either one - i was a big fan of the original superman films and the trailer for click only showed it as a potentially chauvinistic ( which i would n't oppose ) film . superman surprised me with actually having me feel good ( goosebumps ! ) about seeing his first heroic deed , like seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it . but for the rest of the story i 'd rather watch my super ex-girlfriend , at least it offers some surprises . click again was a total surprise , much better and deeper than the trailer and about five minutes away from being a really excellent movie . the jokes also work much better than in ex-girlfriend , both the naughty ones and the more advanced ones . anyway , the only reason i compared these three films is that they are the three last ones i 've seen , within a very short period , and also because i went to all of these with basically no expectations at all . i 'd rank them click , girlfriend , superman .
being a genre film fan , a child of the 80 's and a fan of hard rock music ... this movie holds a special place in my heart . it has everything you could want in a supernatural movie : action , great special effects ( for 1986 ) and a guitar wailing glam- rock soundtrack . it certainly was the movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time . i did n't see this at the cinema because it was never released theatrically over here ... but it 's popularity on video during the mid to late eighties secured it 's cult status and eventually led to a ( sadly , mediocre ) dvd release in 2002 . if you 're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music then this probably is n't your cup of tea ... but , trust me , there are worse films of this type out there ... and , despite average acting and some outrageously ridiculous situations , trick or treat is most definitely a wailing riff above the usual horror fare . you 'll never look at your stereo the same way again . or should i say mp3 player ? trick or treat trivia- marc price ( eddie ) played geeky skippy handelman on the popular long running comedy sitcom 'family ties . ' after a string of direct to video flops including , 'little devils '' killer tomatoes eat france ' and 'the rescue ' he gave up on acting to pursue a career in stand-up comedy . recently , he has been considering a tv comeback . glen morgan ( roger ) is now a major hollywood producer/ screenwriter . he has written and produced several major films and tv series , including : 'space : above and beyond '' the x-files '' final destination '' jet li 's the one '' willard ' and most recently 'final destination 3 ' . tony fields ( sammi ) started his performing career as a dancer on the tv series 'solid gold ' . he appeared in several low budget films and tv shows before landing his breakout role as the devilish sammi curr in 'trick or treat ' . sadly , tony passed away on february 27th 1995 of aids related cancer . doug savant ( tim ) is probably best remembered for his pioneering role of homosexual twentysomething matt fielding on the popular sitcom 'melrose place ' . since then he has had a long and varied acting career , appearing in such films and tv series as : 'the one '' godzilla '' csi : crime scene investigation ' and the short lived joss whedon sci-fi series 'firefly ' . currently he can be seen as tom scavo on the smash hit series 'desperate housewives ' .
kalifornia came out in 1993 , just as 3 of the 4 lead characters were up and coming to the levels of fame they now possess in 2006 . this is a nice psycho-thriller that should appeal to all david duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent narratives that find their ways into his work , like with most of his episodes of the x-files , playing god , and red shoe diaries . people who were put off by the heavy southern accent from brad pitt and juliette lewis ' characters obviously have never spent much time in the south . for every `` brian and carrie '' in the south , there is an `` adele and early '' and in 2006 , that 's the real horror of this flick . aside from that , i think the film was written with a cult film intention - like with carrie 's photography , it 's not suitable for mass consumption . but if you have a copy of this in your personal library , i think it says something positive about your tastes for freaky movies .
earth is a must see for children and adults . my son had great fun watching all these funny birds and ice bears . we can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth . there are some animals in danger to disappear . exactly that problem should prevent all the authorities of our planet . this documentary offers many exceptional pictures that i have never seen before . then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music . the director did a great job here that gets high respect . nothing can stop me and my family to give earth the highest rate . i hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel .
i was electrified when i first saw this in 1983 or 1984 . steven biko is gone half way through the film but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten . i did n't when finally in south africa in 1993 . it is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty . when i was in south africa and heard the audience at a dance recital in natal sing nkosi sikelel ' iafrika , my hair stood on its ends . there is a lot to learn from this story for all peoples .
arthur bach needs to grow up , but that is unfortunately not the only thing he needs to do . according to his extremely rich father , arthur has to marry a certain wealthy susan johnson or he 's cut off from the family money ( $ 750 million dollars worth ) . the problem is , arthur does n't love susan ( though i hear she makes some good chicken ) and has just fallen head-over-heels for the waitress and part-time shop-lifter linda marolla . arthur is an interesting fellow . he 's really just a big kid , born into riches with at least one person looking after him every second of every day . working just rubs arthur the wrong way - he likes to have fun , womanize , and of course , drink . drinking gives arthur a sort of jekyll-and-hyde complex ; and while that gets him into all sorts of trouble , it 's absolutely hilarious to watch on screen . dudley moore is great here in this film as arthur , earning an oscar nomination and golden globe win for his performance . moore is fantastic with the comedic aspects of the film , turning the already funny lines into unforgettable comedic gold , but he is also great in bringing arthur down to a relatable level and making the character likable . moore has some help in the co-star department - liza minnelli is great as lina , the spirited nobody who arthur ca n't get enough of , and john gielgud is terrific as arthur 's butler hobson . gielgud won the best supporting actor oscar for his performance in this film , and there 's no doubting why . hobson has a stone-solid dry wit and stuck up attitude , but he 's always looking out for arthur - and gielgud is perfect in the role . steve gordon 's 1981 film arthur is short and simple , but delivers laughs a-plenty .
`` holly '' is an issue-driven film , but it is neither manipulative nor overly sentimental . at its heart is it is a character-driven film , which would n't be nearly so successful without the fleshed-out portrayals of patrick ( ron livingston ) , the lost soul with the gradually awakening conscience , and holly ( thuy nguyen ) , the strong-willed but ultimately over-matched young vietnamese girl . from the vibrant locations and photography to the effective editing , everything is forthright and well-done . the contemporary classical score may put some off at first , but it is top-notch composition and underscores the admirable restraint which is evident throughout . this film , which raises many issues but provides few clear-cut answers , ultimately succeeds in raising awareness of and compassion for holly and the many who share her plight . kudos to those who managed to get it made .
coming shortly before the imposition of a morality code darkened the spirits of writers , directors and actors , the first film adaptation of w. somerset maugham 's `` of human bondage '' titillated countless moviegoers . it has no shock value today , just fine acting . while the cast is excellent , this is bette davis 's first great role and one of leslie howard 's best performances . howard is english wannabe parisian artist philip carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius . taking the lesson to heart he returns to london and enrolls in a medical college ( one , by the way , that seems to have no female students-at that time there would have been at least a few . perhaps author/physician maugham did n't care for distaff medicos ) . having tea one day carey is entranced by a waitress , mildred rogers , bette davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago . her cockney accent is as sharp as eliza doolittle 's . his repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic reply , `` i do n't mind , '' a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he 's plumbing the depths . maugham 's mildred supplemented her waitress tips with a bit of old fashioned street-walking , something not clearly brought out here . carey 's besotted prostration serves rogers ' avaricious need for support of the financial kind . he is desperately in love with her-she plays him as a sunday church organist effortlessly plies her instrument . no sex here . recognizing that he is getting nowhere , he begins a chaste relationship with norah , a woman who adores him . re-enter mildred , replete with a baby , and in her usual need of being taken care of . exit heartbroken norah . another separation from mildred and carey begins a long-term friendship with sally , abetted enthusiastically by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine offspring . the movie reasonably but not entirely follows maugham 's excellent novel . howard 's carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a doe facing a double-barreled shotgun . mildred is unrestrainedly wicked , a user of the worst kind , her sole preoccupation with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to wheedle carey with a thin patina of affectionate words ( and offers-at one point she promises she 'll do `` anything [ he ] wants , '' a daring statement for the times and one i 'm sure audiences fully understood . pre-code it may be but mildred 's quick-march dissolution would have satisfied the league of catholic decency . the ending is conventional-sin loses , principled behavior triumphs . director john cromwell wrought excellent performances from his two main stars , one well-established , the other established largely because of this film . the atmosphere is 1930s london and the trip back in time is worth taking . available on dvd . 9/10 ( for davis 's and howard 's performances )
this may not be war & peace , but the two academy noms would n't have been forthcoming if it were n't for the genius of james wong howe ... this is one of the few films i 've fallen in love with as a child and gone back to without dissatisfaction . whether you have any interest in what it offers fictively or not , bb & c is a visual feast . i 'm not saying it 's his best work , i 'm no expert there for sure . but the look of this movie is amazing . i love everything about it ; elsa lanchester , the cat , the crazy hoo-doo , the retro-downtown-ness ; but the way it was put on film is breathtaking . i even like the inconsistencies pointed out on this page above , and the `` special effects '' that seem backward now . it all creates a really consistent world .
like a streetcar named desire ( also directed by gadg both on stage and screen ) panic in the streets depicts a new orleans in which its major claim to fame - the birthplace of jazz - does n't even rate a mention . it was richard widmark 's seventh film and arguably went a long way to establishing him as the fine actor he really was rather than merely a psychotic killer . gadg himself appears in an uncredited small role as a morgue attendant but the film is rich in talent beginning with jack palance ( still being billed as walter jack palance ) as the local mr 'big ' followed side-kick zero mostel , barbara bel geddes , emile meyer , tommy rettig plus the rock-solid ever reliable paul douglas as the cop who comes round to doc widmark 's point of view . it 's a very rewarding movie more so for being little seen . catch it if you can .
`` i moved out here to get away from this kind of thing ! '' the small town sheriff laments . `` this happens a lot in chicago ? '' his deputy asks . well , no , not really . the plot is that a group of martians mistake a halloween rebroadcast of orson welles ' war of the worlds as an account of a real martian invasion , and conclude they need to get in on the action ! what follows are a bunch of mishaps involving the martian 's haphazard attempts to conquer the town of `` big bean , il '' . everyone concludes they are kids in really good costumes , except for the sheriff 's daughter and her friend , a kid in a duck suit . the martians themselves are comical , and you get the impression they are no threat to anyone but themselves pretty early on . it 's a fun family movie .
it 's a tale that could have taken place anywhere really , given the right circumstances . street entertainer catching the attention of famous opera star and friendship ensuing . the aging entertainer finds/buys a male child to pass his art to . from there , we follow them through the rigors of their challenging , but free life along the river . traveling town to town , he performs and has some degree of notoriety . despite the times and the influences , the man is kind and good . overall , the performances are first rate , especially xu zhu , who portrays the street performer . the child ( renying zhou ) is beautiful , and downright strong , and withstands the overt prejudices well . the two protagonists , along with supporting help from the kind opera singer , master liang ( an interestingly androgynous zhao zhigang ) , paint a very interesting tale of forgiveness , sadness and love . some have mentioned this film 's remote similarities to ba wang bie ji ( farewell my concubine ) ; yet this film ca n't stand easily on its own , any resemblance is remote at best . my only qualm with the king of masks , is the ending . it was weak , cliche and about as subtle as a sledgehammer . the audience was already wrapped up in the story , what was the needless manipulation for ? what a shame . to bring a fine motion picture that far , only to surrender to emotional ( and corny ) pathos like that . it frankly made this film good , instead of the classic , it should 've been . that aside , the king of masks is still very well worth your time . i was happy to see the shaw brothers are still producing good films . highly recommended .
the film is exceptional in it 's gay iconography and extends this beyond the asthetics to the music and cast . throughout the whole film exists a childlike wonder as seen through the eyes of the main character . her lighthearted take on the world around us is comical and beautiful . in a way it 's a slacker movie for girls . watch this is you fancy a relaxing entertaining mid-night movie . buy this if you like diferent takes on the world of media and love combined ( ? ) .
in iran , women are officially banned from men 's sporting events . in june 2005 , the iran 's national soccer team has an important game against bahrain in the azadi stadium for the qualification of the world cup . a group of iranian girls and lovers of soccer dresses like boys and unsuccessfully attempts to enter in the stadium being arrested . soccer ( and flamengo 's team ) , beach and movies are my greatest passions ; therefore i loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for soccer . the director jafar panahi , from `` the white balloon '' , `` the mirror '' and `` the circle '' , shot this movie on the day that iran defeated bahrain and qualified to the world cup in germany . the dramatic and funny adventure of these iranian girls is one of the most delightful movies i have ever seen . my vote is nine . title ( brazil ) : not available
in this glorious telling of a weekend shared among literary greats . mary and percy shelly , lord byron and others created a entrancing group . showing their quests for sexual enlightenment . personal freedoms from political to moral . liberal drug use for both stimulations and as addiction . their creative views of life and writing . describing without boring the viewer how each writer seeks to find their muse . along with the distractions and affections each share . with breathtaking scenery that does not detract but very much enhances the story . well created characters from grim to loving then angry to peaceful . with some of the most lovely and scene enhancing costuming to be had .
some genre films need to be dressed up . this one was an exception . taken on its own merit , it 's a dressed down version of the horror genre film . with minimal special effects , it manages to be a psychological study of sorts , with a simple yet existential theme - who gets hit by the bus , and why her ? it 's not a great film , yet because there is little contrived about it , the story works . subtle , and all about the interactions of the characters . actually , there is one contrivance in the opening scenes , but it may have been placed there to simply set the tone for what 's to come . i very much appreciate the balance of male and female energy , and would not recommend this story to anyone interested in more than people reacting to a physical and psychological challenge . you will enjoy the film if you have some empathy , value the need for a bit of adventure in your life , and wonder `` what would i do in this situation ? ''
what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me , on second viewing , a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation . spoiler of sorts follows . poor cedric ; he apparently did n't know what hit him . poor audience ; we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch . these two guys just did n't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter . as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other , the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu , an intellectual being , to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach . on a purely technical note , i loved the camera action in this film . subtitles were totally unnecessary , even though my french is `` presque rien . '' i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more . this was a polished , very professionally made motion picture . though many scenes seem superfluous , i rate it nine out of ten .
i know that there are some purists out there who poo poo anything that is not exactly like the original , however sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own merits . i like the new iron chef because it is similar enough to the japanese version but at the same time caters to american spirit . i love alton brown as commentator , because he explains things with flair . the iron chefs themselves are very interesting . i know the originals were probably the best chefs on the planet at the time , but bobby flay is the only american iron chef to beat them . mario batali seems to have the most fun when cooking , making comments and being flashy while creating . i have watched the series and find all the players work together well . the judges are not always the best choices , however . there are a few exceptions , like the lawyer turned foodie , but most of the judges are questionable in being able to handle what is served . i enjoy watching the chefs hustle and the challengers are surprising . the food at the end always looks amazing and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen . perhaps that is all anyone can ask , to want to really eat what is served . the only thing i would really change about the series is to ask folks on the show to lighten up a little . sometimes the mood becomes a bit too tense , and that is n't always fun to watch when you are expecting more amusement . i liked the version with william shatner ( iron chef usa ) because it was so over-the-top like the original , but i can tell it was a pretty expensive proposition . i wish he had stayed with this version and been the host - between bill shatner and alton brown , that would have me grinning for an hour . as long as you do n't expect the original japanese version and can accept this series on its own merits , you may find it to be an enjoyable hour .
a very high-standard columbo story which was actually the first filmed episode of the long-running series but was originally transmitted second ( after `` murder by the book '' ) . robert culp makes his first of three appearances as the guest murderer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency , who blackmails the wife ( patricia crowley ) of a rich , highly influential businessman ( played very sympathetically by ray milland ) after he falsifies a report , in her favour , after it is discovered she was having an affair . the wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage .... a very satisfying episode in many respects , particularly as the plot is so strongly set-up and subsequently developed and also because of the rare columbo ingredient that the crime is an unpremeditated killing . the whole thing is further enhanced when the widowed husband uses the murderer to assist columbo in his investigations : a feature that facilitates numerous good quality scenes , particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and columbo 's crucially deceptive qualities are wonderfully in evidence . directed with flair by bernard l. kowalski and acted to an appropriately high level , this really set the tone for whole series ( since `` murder by the book '' was let down by a poor ending ) . the script by columbo creators richard levinson and william link is precise , well-structured and well-thought-out and is underpinned by a steady , productive pace and meaningful sequences which really exhibit the unpredictability of the story . ultimately , the finale fittingly epitomises that columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer . overall , this is a very fine piece of detective work for columbo , and strongly suggests that the production team had worked positively and constructively to render a polished columbo story .
uneducated & defiant , beautiful tess of the storm country is the daughter of a fisherman squatting on a rich man 's land . spirited & bold , she captures the heart of the millionaire 's son , but violence , terror & sudden death are what will haunt her immediate future before she can claim the sweet peace of happiness . mary pickford is utterly charming in this splendid , heart-wrenching film . she considered tess to be her favorite role and she fills it with all the spunky joy & enthusiasm which made her for years the world 's most popular movie star . the story has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale , with mary the lovely , distressed heroine beset by all manner of dangerous , stressful situations . the atmospherics are first-rate , with the outdoor fishing village sets being particularly well-conceived . in the supporting cast , jean hersholt stands out as the vile villain who tries forcing pickford to marry him . hersholt , a very gentle soul off screen , manages brilliantly to depict his character 's complete moral corruption . this was actually the second time pickford filmed tess . a 1914 version had been one of her first important films , but its production values were a bit antiquated by the standards of the 1920 's ( no close-ups , for instance ) and mary , producing her own films & powerful enough by 1922 to make whatever film she wanted , decided for the only time in her career to remake a film . the end result certainly lived up to her expectations . both films were very popular at the box office . a fascinating study for some future film researcher would be the influence of christianity in mary pickford 's life ; it certainly runs like a golden thread through the silent movies she produced . although the romanticism inherent in the very nature of silent cinema might cause these spiritual sentiments to appear somewhat awkward today , we are compelled to accept them as sincere reflections , by their very repetition , of mary 's heartfelt beliefs . in tess , one beautiful scene in particular stands out in this regard : pickford is teaching herself to read using a bible . she indicates to lloyd hughes ( who plays her sweetheart ) a word from near the back of the book that she does not understand . he mimes it for her ( the word is obviously ` crucified ' ) and , eyes turned heavenward as the full meaning of the sacrifice dawns upon her , mary 's face becomes positively beatific . a splendid new orchestral score for tess has been supplied by jeffrey mark silverman which perfectly underscores the beauty & pathos of this wonderful film .
listening to the soundtrack at the moment , the images come back with a vividness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong ( in order to be able to type this ) . i 've seen it twice thus far , and i should be ashamed for having seen it * only * twice . i 've seen all miyazaki & studio ghibli films , and they are invariably nothing less than masterpieces ( except maybe for nausicaa which was , even in the non-cut up version too premature compared to the nec-plus-ultra manga ) . still , their strength sometimes becomes their weakness , as they tend to get too naive/positive ( chihiro ) , or , with more nuance , a bit too explicit/moralist ( mononoke ) . at least , compared to for example the other ghibli master takahata ( grave of the fireflies / only yesterday / raccoon wars ) . but not this one . in laputa , miyazaki pours all the brilliant storytelling that tellers of tales have gathered and perfected over the ages , combined with a bit of morale , but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere , but also with the humor and amusement of for example totoro . every single main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties . the pacing is so perfect that i know of nothing except a black hole that would be able to exert such a gravitational pull on your whole being . the story sets out as an action flic with mysteries hinted at , but when the girl falls from the sky , unconscious , floating with the stone , and the main theme kicks in , you get a glimpse of the grand mystery you 're about to uncover , but the story then settles and gradually , over a number of carefully selected scenes of action and serene beauty , builds to an unforgettable climax of melancholy , hope , beauty - like , following days of sombre gloom , finally seeing the horizon on a clear morning , knowing the path walked , seeing the distance ahead , but smiling at the mere fact of being able to catch a glimpse of it . it is so like an exploding white light in your skull that if by the time the credits start rolling you have kept your eyes dry and your mind numb , you should see a therapist . despite the fact that technically-image-wise some more recent miyazakis might be more overwhelming , this to me remains his undisputed masterpiece . if you take a fraction of a second to realise that this was made back in 1986 , you can only come to the conclusion that hayao miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years . this of course has been suggested before , but to me this is his only film that can , on its own , fully illustrate that simple fact . if you miss this during your lifetime , you 'll die with a huge gap - which would be a pity , as the coffin costs the same .
this movie was very good because it remember when i was young when i maked snow castle . it was so fun . this movie is interessant . this is a good quebeker movie with no much money and is also a magical movie because their wonderfull castle is very big and beautiful .
i just recently watched this on the sundance channel . the idea for the film was to bring many filmmakers , illustrious in their own country , to make short films , eleven of them , all in one film , concentrating on just one subject : september 11 . from wacthing this movie i could tell why these filmmakers were great in their country because it had all elements of a great film . the movie starts off with a film from iran in which a teacher struggles to teach the students about what had happened with september 11 which they fail to realize until later . the second film from france involves a deaf women who writes a letter to her lover angrily while she is unaware of what is going as the t.v plays . the next film from egypt involves the filmmaker himself talking with a dead soldier about recent events not only about terrorists of 9/11 but bombings in other places . the next comes from bolivia in which a girl learns about the events of september 11 and believes they must march for them . the next from a country in africa in which a group of boys follow a man whom they believe to be bin ladin . the next comes from mexico in which nothing is shown but the sounds of that day . the next from israel involving a reporter at the scene of a bomb trying to get a report but is frequently told about the attacks . there are other films that i ca n't remember at the moment but all of them are powerful . it will bring back your emotions from that day . 10/10
well , i 'd heard from somewhere that ossessione is a precursor to the italian film genre , and particular favourite of mine , the 'giallo ' ... but actually , aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in italy ; the two have pretty much no relation . in the sixties and seventies , italian film-makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful american film released . they 've not done that here , but ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later american film 'the postman always rings twice ' , without giving the book 's author , james m. cain , so much as a credit ! anyway , the plot focuses on gino costa , a handsome drifter who , by chance , stumbles upon a café where a woman named giovanna bragana works . he soon learns that she 's married to giuseppe ; a big fat annoying man , whom giovanna ca n't stand to have even touching her . he wants the pair of them to run away together , but she 's not so keen on the idea . however , fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful ... despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it 's based on , it has to be said that director luchino visconti implements the film noir style well , and in a way i even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger american noir classics . the story is , as you would expect , extremely strong and the visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast . visconti drags the film out a little bit too much , however , and with a running time of almost 135 minutes , i felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length . i almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at ossessione as it is a good film , but it 's not a 'great ' film . the relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly , and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters ' heads . there 's not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what 's going on , and by not always focusing on the characters themselves ; the film is not as interesting as it could have been . still , it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason ... although it 's not as good as the 1946 version of the same james m. cain classic .
cypher is a clever , effective and eerie film that delivers . its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands . although one could immediately label the film a science fiction , there is a little more to it . it has it 's obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir/detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story . the film , overall , plays out like it 's some kind of nightmare ; thus building and retaining a good atmosphere . we 're never sure of what exactly is going on , we 're never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we 're not entirely sure of certain people , similar to having a dream  the ambiguity reigns over us all  hero included and i have n't seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before , bar terry gilliam 's brazil . going with the eeriness stated earlier , cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective , noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there 's something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well . there is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story . the mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and i find the fact that the character of rita foster ( liu ) , who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale , can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero : people whom appear as friends actually are n't , people who say they 're helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look . despite a lot of switching things around , twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they 're not carried out ; the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with lucy liu 's character  and she 's trying to help out ( ! ) the film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage , spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents . the whole thing plays out like some sort of mini-cold war ; something that resembles the u.s.a. and the u.s.s.r. in their war of word 's heyday and it really pulls through given the black , bleak , often cgi littered screen that i was glued to . what was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain american states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations  significant then how the more he acts on his and foster 's own motivation this sequence disappears because he 's breaking away from the computerised , repetitive , controlled life that he 's being told to live and is branching out . cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film . to say it resembles the first jason bourne film , only set in the sci-fi genre , is n't cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities ; despite them both being released in the same year . like i mentioned earlier , there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict , you will find yourself enjoying this film .
i took a chance on `` hardcastle and mccormick '' by purchasing the first season 's worth ( canadian release ) from amazon . when i got it , i started with the pilot , and i was instantly hooked after that . i rated it 5 stars on amazon , and i am rating it 10 stars here . it is just that good . what i liked about it were the opening and closing themes , and of course stephen j. cannell 's logo at the end of each episode , but most of all , the relationship between the judge and mark as they worked together to crack each case . i was so hooked that i also purchased the second season as a companion , and i enjoyed it equally . if you do not have this excellent series on disc , i believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection .
`` homeward bound : the incredible journey '' is one of those wonderful old movies about house pets . deserves a place among the great movies of its genre and even the cinema world in general , together with other animal movies like `` old yeller '' , `` napoleon '' , `` fluke '' and `` air bud '' . this means it is more than just a movie about pets . can this possibly be just a `` remake '' ? it is too good to be a `` remake '' ! i know this one by heart , since my early teen years ( when i was 12 ) . it 's a family movie to treasure . it 's emotional , thrilling , adventurous , exciting , entertaining , humorous , charming , sweet , nostalgic , beautiful , heartwarming and sometimes dramatic . it 's one of those movies to put a smile on the faces of those who appreciate this kind of films . this movie does not lack qualities . it has a well thought story , enjoyable characters , excellent and relaxing instrumental soundtrack , dazzling sceneries/landscapes of the magnificent sierra mountains ( in oregon ) . speaking of the vistas , it 's not all mountains : forests , trees , rivers , waterfalls , sunsets ... in conclusion , all of pure nature 's wonders - truly a full panorama . the main human characters are nice , well developed and well portrayed by respective actors . robert hays is awesome as the kind-hearted dad , bob seaver . kim greist is good as laura burnford . veronica lauren is equally good as hope . kevin chevalia is conventional as the youngest and cute brother jamie ( his appearance actually reminds me very much of kevin corcoran in `` old yeller '' ) . benj thall is great as peter burnford . when it comes to our quadruped pals , shadow is my favorite . shadow is the loyal , wise , mature , beautiful , caring and loving old golden retriever ( brilliantly voiced by don ameche ) . chance , the american bulldog , is the opposite of shadow . he is carefree , silly , impatient , anxious , clumsy , hilarious and loves to play ( voiced by the talented michael j . fox ) . chance just ca n't stand still . sassy is the epitome of cats 's image : elegant , independent , very confident and self-proud , with a typical cat attitude but with a certain feline charm . sassy is a seal point himalayan cat , one of the most beautiful cat breeds . sassy is voiced by sally field , who also does a good job . our four-legged friends are , themselves , great `` actors '' by nature : ben as shadow , rattler as chance and tiki as sassy . it 's an underrated movie , but a classic by its own right . its sequel is clearly inferior . this should definitely be on top 250 .
for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart , this is one of his `` lesser '' films from later in his career . and , while it is n't a great film compared to many of his other pictures , it is n't bad and is a decent time-passer -- but not much more . kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason , she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her . over time , the cold and detached ms. novak also begins to fall in love with stewart -- and apparently in the witch 's rule book , this is a definite no , no ! ! the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches . they are neither the baby-sacrificing nor the all-powerful variety . most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless ( such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps ) . and , very oddly , the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz . considering what i think of jazz , it must really stink to be a witch in this movie 's world ! anyway , the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic , but not something i would rush out to watch . the acting is pretty good , but the script does n't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film -- in fact , i almost scored the film a 6 -- it was really close .
i saw this movie when i was in israel for the summer . my hebrew is not fluent , so the subtitles were very useful , i did n't feel lost at any point in the movie . you tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes . this movie blew me away ! ! ! ! ! ! it depicts two of the most prominent taboos in the middle east today : a homosexual relationship between an israeli and a palestinian . it allows a person to enter both realms of the conflict simultaneously . the dilemma , the emotions entailed . the movie climaxes in tragedy when anger and rage drive one of the lovers to one extremist side ! an absolute must see ! !
'one-round ' jack sander is called that because he 's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience . if they can last one round , they win a prize -- a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago . jack is in love with the ticket girl , mabel , though her head is quickly turned when bob corby enters the ring to try his chances with jack . what no one at the fight knows is that bob is the champ , so he 's able to beat jack -- though it takes him some work . as a result , bob asks jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit . later , jack improves so much that he , too , becomes a legitimate boxer . slowly , he works his way up the rankings until he 's nearly ready to take on the champ . in the meantime , the champ and mabel start running around behind jack 's back -- even though by now mabel has married jack . so , when the final fight occurs between jack and bob , it 's very personal and jack is ready to kill him . is he good enough ? will rise justifiable rage against bob help or hinder his performance ? tune in and see . this film was directed by alfred hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery-suspense films , back in the 1920s , hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote ( he did both for this film ) . in fact , in many ways this film is more indicative of hitchcock 's silent style , as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents , the manxman ( also starring carl brisson as the wronged husband ) . so , while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day , it was not a radical departure for this great director -- even with its rather formulaic ending . overall , while a bit predictable and having ian hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly , the film works well . while far from a perfect silent , it 's well worth seeing and packs a nice punch .
saw this saturday night at the provincetown film festival , and it 's a stick-to-your-bones movie -- it 's really stayed with me . adapted very smartly from what is probably an excellent novel , it 's a back-and-forth-in-time drama with fully rounded characters , thoughtful rumination on life choices , and , i 'm not exaggerating . one of the greatest casts ever assembled in 100+ years of movie-making . wonderful work from everyone , led by a luminous vanessa redgrave as a dying , deluded newport matron , and claire danes as her much younger self . meryl streep 's daughter mamie gummer is , like mama , the real deal ; patrick wilson looks like paul newman circa 1958 and does n't overplay the charm ; and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as barry bostwick and eileen atkins contributing sharp , detailed cameos . hugh dancy , also from the stage , does n't bring much edge to the somewhat clichéd role of an unhappy rich wastrel , and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow . but it 's a deliberately paced , visually gorgeous meditation on real life issues , and you can cry at it and not feel like you 're being recklessly manipulated . also , what a sumptuous parade of 1940s/50s automobiles .
'the second beginning ' as it 's title explains , shows us the beginning of the end for the human race . set long before the matrix existed , this short anime written by the wachowski 's shows us the world that could lay infront of us in the not to distant future , set at the turn of the 21st century , the second renaissance delves into issues common with human behaviour ; greed , power , control , vanity etc . the use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or servents is common among science fiction/fantasy stories . the second renaissance is no exeption to this concept , however instead of a simple man vs. machine layout , this story explains the struggle that the machines put up with , the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by humans . where the matrix films show us the human perspective , these short animations tell both sides of the story . the second renaissance part 1 + 2 , answer many questions brought up by the original matrix film , such as how the war broke out , how the sky was blackend , what led to the use of humans as batteries and it also introduces us to the machine city called 01 , which may have relevance to the upcoming matrix revolutions film . i wo n't give away too much of the story , as i do not want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers , however , i will recommend it to anybody interested in the world of the matrix or simply anybody interested in japanese animation ( anime ) . 9/10 .
how can anyone not love this movie ? i think it 's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies ; if you 've never seen them , watch this instead . michael keaton has a ball in this role as anything goes . one guy mangles the english language everytime he talks and griffin dunn plays a clueless d.a. , but my favorite role has got to be joe piscopo . he has all the best lines . danny devito , alan hale , ray walston are in this star-studded movie that lampoons gangsters a lot funnier than `` mafia '' did for the criminal underground .
i 'll tell you a tale of the summer of 1994 . a friend and i attended a canada day concert in barrie , and it was a who 's who of the top canadian bands of the age . we got there about 4am , waited in line most of the morning , and when the doors opened at 9am , we were among the first inside the gates . we then waited and waited in the hot sun , slowly broiling but we did n't care , because the headliners were among our favourites . at one point , early in the afternoon , i sat down and dozed off with my back to the barrier . i was awakened to my shock and dismay by a shrieking girl wearing a rheostatics t-shirt . this is the reason i have hated the rheostatics to this day . there 's nothing reasonable , nor taste-determined , nor really anything except their fandom . snotty of me , is n't it ? so , i , in my hatred of the band , have denied myself the delight that is whale music . desmond howl had it all . it 's hard to say what he 's lost , since he lives in a fantastic mansion wedged between the ocean and the mountains ( the bc region where the movie was shot is breathtaking ) . the life most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams , phantoms , and his own past , until the day a teenaged criminal breaks in ... and , trite as it sounds , breaks him out . canadian cinema suffers from several problems . generally , a lack of money , as well as an insufferable lack of asking for help ( as if somehow the feature would cease to be canadian ) leads to lower production values than american or british films , and most people do n't like to watch anything that sounds or looks like , well , not like an american film . next , canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story , and tell it well . third , they seem to think that gratuitous nudity ( often full-frontal ) makes something artistic . i 'm sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies , especially late at night on the cbc , knows exactly what i 'm talking about . it 's almost like a `` do n't do this '' handbook exists out there somewhere and canadian film-makers threw it out a long time ago . in the 90s and 00s , however , some films ( such as bruce mcdonald 's work and the brilliant c.r.a.z.y . ) have broken this mold , and managed to maintain what makes them canadian , while holding onto watchable production values and great stories . whale music is such a film , on the surface . deeper than just its canadian-isms , it 's a deeply moving story of a man who 's lost his grip , through grief and excess , who is redeemed by music then by love . and that redeems even the rheostatics . : )
it 's not easy making a movie with 18 different stories in it . although 18 different international directors took the challenge , not everyone of them is good , some of them even boring . but in his entity , `` paris , je t'aime '' is breathtaking , showing that , as `` love actually '' put it , 'love is all around ' , especially in the city of love . here 's a resumé ( i 'll try to make at as spoiler-free as possible ) of the 18 different stories . montmartre - kind of a dull opening sequence , nothing really special about it . a man finds a parking spot , and sees a lot of odd couples walking by , wondering why he ca n't find a girl . and than , suddenly , a woman faints next to his car ... quais de seine - another dull sequence , about three teenage boys who are searching for some 'piece of ass ' , when suddenly a muslim girl trips right in front of them , receiving help from one of the boys . really basic , but with a sweet heart to it . les marais - this was a huge disappointment ! although a love story between two boys with an artsy background could have been interesting by the great van sant . eventually , everything that comes after the monologue by ulliel is good , everything before it is just annoying . tuileries - an entertaining sequence by the coen brothers . buscemi - without even saying one word - is mesmerizing and the whole sequence is just hilarious . this one kept me hooked until the very end , and this one also gets you truly hooked to the movie . loin du 16ieme - a beautiful story too , even if the execution is poor , the heart is there . it 's the story of an hispanic woman who drops her child off , early in the morning , to take care of another suburban baby . beautiful . porte de choisy - this segment has got to be the strangest and weirdest from the whole movie . some kind of shampoo salesman arrives in a chinatown-lookalike place in paris . if i understood it correctly , the story is about inner beauty , but i think i 'm wrong . bastille - a truly wonderful sequence . a man meets with his wife at a restaurant , to break up with her , so that he can run off with his mistress . but the wife has some devastating news . pretty basic , but truly sad and beautiful ! place des victoires - a sad sequence as well . juliette binoche plays a grieving mother . one night , she wakes up hearing her dead child . when she arrives at the location , a cowboy tells her she can give one last good-bye to her child . one of the best segments ! tour eiffel - two mimes who fall in love could have been great , but , even though it has some nice cinematic tricks , the story is n't intriguing and not funny at all . parc monceau - a truly original and great sequence , one of the best of the movie ! a young girl and an older man discuss their future and her fear for a certain man ... cuaron does a great directing job , and the actors are amazing ! quartier des enfants rouges - an american actress ( gyllenhaal ) falls in love with her drug dealer . a beautiful segment again , with a very sad ending place des fetes - a woman comes to a homeless man , he starts talking romantic to her ... because she is the love of his life . beautiful , sad , shocking , romantic , ... place des fêtes will make everyone cry . pigalle - a boring sequence between ardant and hoskins , who are looking for new thrills in their relationship ... very unfunny and unromantic , pigalle is a let-down . quartier de la madeleine - bringing some diversity in the movie , qdlm is a relief . a young guy ( wood ) finds a vampire killing a victim ... the tourist and the vampire ... fall in love ! dark , scary and oddly romantic , madeleine is superb . pere-lachaise - another let-down segment . directed by wes craven and with stars as mortimer and sewell , it could have been great , but père-lachaise is just ordinary , not original at all . faubourg saint-denis - the rumors are true , twyker 's short film is beautiful , stunning and well done . a blind man picks up the phone , and hears from his girlfriend ( portman - truly stunning ) that she breaks up with him . he reflects on their relationship . quartier latin - even though this segment has been co-directed by depardieu and has such stars as rowlands , gazzara and depardieu , this segment is a let-down too . nothing happens , lack of chemistry between the actors . 14th arrondissement - the last sequence is hilarious and sad at the same time . an american tells in her french class about her trip to paris . her french is truly terrible , but at the end of the segment , she realizes that paris is so much more than meets the eye . with feist on the background , `` paris , je t'aime '' ends in a sweet tone , not letting me down at all , even though some segments bored the hell out of me , the entity of the movie is great ! a true cinematic experience for young and old . paris , je t'aime vraiment !
i saw this movie with my dad . i must have been pretty young , around 15 . it was on star movies one afternoon.the movie started a bit vaguely , but you could tell those robbers were gathering up for a score . it really caught pace after the first half hour . all the actors are great , especially blades and lou diamond . i guess it 's the ensemble , they just play so well together . i can watch this film anytime.i think it is the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters trying to deal with a very weird score . the jokes are not corny but they are subtle and extreme at the same time that make them so hilarious . a perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon .
my take : makes use of its familiar plot with fine performances and a few genuine moments of excitement . the plot is familiar . an innocent man is framed for a plot to assassinate the president of the united states , the first traitor in the united states secret service . as his fellow secret-service agents pursue him , he tries to prove his innocence . of course we know his innocent , and the real culprit is just around the corner , but i was still entertained by the sentinel . in this time where thrillers are reduced to being too ludicrous and too abundant in action sequences , the sentinel is a good lick-back to all those good old-fashioned political crime thriller . the familiar plot is elevated by neat thrilling sequences and terrific performances . michael douglas , the perfect man for the job , is long-running secret service agent pete garrison , who is framed for being part of a plot to assassinate the president . former colleagues in the secret service ( kiefer sutherland and eva longoria ) pursue harrison while he tries to find out who is behind the possible assassination and the traitor in the secret service . this leads to a lot of chase scenes that , surprisingly ( and thankfully ) , are never unbelievable . the screenplay also offers a subplot involving garrison having an affair with the first lady ( played by kim basinger ) . this thankfully was n't unnecessary like most subplots are to these kinds of films . the films director is clark johnson ( s.w.a.t . ) who manages to make the film look good . although many have criticized it as `` should have been a tv movie '' , i must disagree . agreed , this is not a perfect film , and much of it is inspired from other action thrillers and political intrigues like in the line of fire or an episode from the tv series 24 ( which this film closely resembles when it comes to style and star sutherland ) , but even so , this film takes its plot into serious heights and does n't abandon even its smaller details . the performances are terrific ( with a top-notch cast , its bound to be , even with the by-the-numbers script . all-in-all , i award it * * * 1/2 , not perfect , but not far from it . rating : * * * 1/2 out of 5 .
what can i say that has n't been said about `` the haunting '' ? it has everything that would make a great picture . wonderful sets , moody music , and sound design to die for were all in place . the screenplay , though , sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird , surrealistic way . the entire team must have forgotten to read it through , maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was . each member of the cast gives a worthy performance , although with little conviction to the material at hand . lili taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her . but that 's about it . all i can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours , but you will definitely want more . a lot more .
i saw this gem of a film at cannes where it was part of the directors fortnight . welcome to collinwood is nothing short of superb . great fun throughout , with all members of a strong cast acting their socks off . it 's a sometimes laugh out loud comedy about a petty crook ( cosimo , played by luis guzman ) who gets caught trying to steal a car and sent to prison . while in prison he meets a ` lifer ' who tells him of ` the ultimate bellini '  which to you and me  is a sure-fire get rich quick scheme . it turns out that there is a way through from a deserted building into the towns jewellers shop  which could net millions . sounds simple ?  well throw in all kinds of wacky characters and incidents along the way and you have got the ingredients for a one wild ride ! !  word passes from one low life loser to the next and soon a team of them are assembled to try and cash in on cosimos ` bellini ' lead by failed boxer pero ( superbly played by sam rockwell  surely a star in the making ) and reluctant crook riley ( william h. macy ) who is forced to bring his baby along with him as his wife was locked up for fraud ! ! . based on the italian film i soliti ignoti ( big deal on madonna street ) which also inspired a similar film to ` collinwood '  ` palookaville ' . this knocks spots of the latter effort and although its written and directed by the russo brothers it definitely has shades of the coen brothers about it . produced by steven soderbergh and george clooney , who has a small yet hilarious part as a crippled safe breaker .
i had the privilege of watching `` holly '' at the edinburgh film festival last week . what a powerful and moving story ! holly is a 12 yr old vietnamese girl who is sold into prostitution by her own family and living in a brothel in cambodia . patrick ( an american ) comes into holly 's life and decides he wants to help her . when holly is sold again , patrick desperately searches for her . we follow they 're difficult journey through cambodia and hope for their reunion . holly is one of millions of children who are sold and trafficked every day . the movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line . i walked away wanting to know more about the issue of child trafficking and asking how can i help ? this movie should be seen by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it exposes an issue that we should no longer ignore .
let me set the scene . it is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies . i am with my friend deciding what to see . we look for a movie that is starting soon and `` the grinch '' comes up . we buy tickets not knowing what to expect . what we got was a roller coaster of fun . jim carrey ( who may i add is my no.1 actor in the whole world ) was absolutely magnificent as the grinch in this ron howard 's best movie ( next to apollo 13 ) . the way that this movie was made , the scenery , the actors , the props and the music was just amazing . it really brought this childhood movie to life . the story is based upon the story of the grinch . as we all know the grinch is a horrible person who just ca n't stand christmas . he lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk . but one little girl is going to change the grinch 's look on life and on others in a drastic way . cindy lou who ( played by adorable new actress taylor momsem ) meets the grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away . she attempts to break the barrier and to help the grinch move in and mingle with the towns people . all up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents . a solid 10/10 . well done jim .
riget ii is a good sequel , but not quite as good as the first one . this series do n't seem to be quite as serious as the first one . there are much more comedy in this , good one , though . we 're back at the danish rigshospitalet , the danish national hospital . mrs. drusse is just about to leave the hospital as her work is done , but fate want 's it otherwise . she is soon chasing ghosts and helmer is doing everyone mad and it 's soon to get much worse as black powers are unleashed in the kingdom . this story involves a lot more comedy that the previous . by all means lot of fun , but it makes you take the series a little less serious . the story has kept a lot of elements from the last series and added some new ones . it 's well written , but some of the new elements are just kind of silly , but they save it by making it more like a comedy . good story , but not as good , original and thrilling as the first series . the actors are the same with some addition to the regular cast . they are all very good . it 's an odd story and setting . some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show so to keep it serious and keep it real is not an easy job . yet , these actors handle this whole situation perfectly . much of the good qualities from the first series are kept intact . the cinematography is one of those qualities . the hand-held camera that made trier world famous gives suspense and reality to the series . it gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and trier makes use of these abilities . good , movement , great lightning and good composition and editing makes this enjoyable to watch . be prepare to see better effect in this sequel that in the first . also be prepared to see some more . i did n't think that green thing looked all too good . thought it was unoriginal and did n't fit . never the less , the effects like the ghosts are really good . the non-digital effects looks good too . little brother looks just really odd , but you accept it . all over i 'd say effects are from ok to good . the music is also quite good . moody and nice . some of it are really touching . it fits really nice . as the first one there are rather little music in the action scenes and it works very well . all together this makes a good sequel . if you 'd seen riget you can see this one without being disappointed . it has many of the same qualities as the first series . however , i would recommend seeing the first series before seeing this . these two makes up a series you do n't wan na miss .
kimi wa petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy inside a box that is outside her apartment one day . she decides to bring him in and fix his cuts . she then leaves a note for him to eats some food she made then go home because she had to go to work . when she gets home however she finds that he is still there . he tells her that he wants to live there with her like a brother or cousin . in desperation to get him to leave she tells him that if he became her pet then he could stay . and as a pet she says that he would have no rights and do whatever she told him . ( not in that perverted way ! ) to her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as momo , her pet .
is this the future that awaits us ? an overpopulated , unforgiving wasteland with a hellish , unwanted existence ? this film brings to mind a problem that still plagues us , doubly so since the film was released in back in 1973 . let 's hope that the world is n't going to end up like this ... soylent green is a wild movie that i enjoyed very much . it had likable characters , a semi-apocalyptic setting , a compelling and thought-provoking storyline , and the macho-est macho man out there : charleton heston . richard fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant , dirty feel . you 're almost choked by the stench from the city and its filthy inhabitants . the characters are wonderful . charleton heston , who has become one of my favorite actors , is thorn . the man created this role of badass , yet likable tough-guy . i could definitely put myself in thorn 's shoes . he sees that something is n't right , but everyone around him either does n't listen ( more like paid not to listen ) or wants him dead . edward g. robinson ( in his last film , r.i.p . ) plays the lovable old sol , who has had enough of this nasty place . everyone else is great , especially leigh taylor-young as shirl , a piece of `` furniture '' that comes with the apartment in which she resides . the special effects are fantastic , even for 1973 . the soylent green factory , the futuristic apartments , and especially the `` scoops '' ( bulldozers that get rid of people ) were excellent . the polluted air outside looks disgusting and very nasty . the empty city streets filled with the vile and putrid people are very unsettling . one final note is the ending , which even now still shocked me . it is gruesome , but if you think about it , it 's a pretty good idea . the bottom line : an excellent 70 's science fiction flick that makes you think and leaves you feeling very uneasy .
brand hauser ( john cusack ) is an assassin for the cia . he is ordered to go to the country of turaquistan , a nation that the united states has `` liberated '' , and kill a businessman named omar shariff . this is because the american conglomerate , tamerlane , that is putting the country `` back together '' will not stand for shariff , an oil man from a neighboring state , laying down his own pipeline through war-torn turquistan . but , once there , brand runs into difficulties . one , he meets a determined journalist , natalie ( marisa tomei ) who wants to tell the american public the `` true '' story of the region 's conflict ... and of tamerlane . but , brand is aghast to realize that natalie 's pretty face and sharp mind instantly and unconsciously compels him to lose focus on his mission . also , his cover as a trade show host forces him to meet the country 's pop-singing princess , yonica ( hillary duff ) , who will be getting married at the convention center . she is a young diva whose wedding arrangements also turn brand 's attention away from the coming assassination . with other inept underlings and complications , will brand be able to carry out his mission , for the satisfaction of tamerlane 's big boss , the former vice-president ( dan ackroyd ) ? good for you , john cusack , to make this film , even though it does n't quite hold together . shot in serbia , it is a worthy look at what present-day iraq must be like , a country turned upside-down . in a stroke a brilliance , the green zone here is called `` the emerald city '' and aptly so , for this oz-like neighborhood attempts to keep out the ravages of war going on elsewhere in the metropolis . the cast is very fine , with cusack doing a nice job and tomei , joan cusack , ben kingsley , ackroyd and others backing him up in style . duff , especially , does a great turn as the heavily-accented , heavily made-up , potty-mouthed singer . the recreation of war-riddled baghdad is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are top-notch . as for the script , it is n't always cohesive but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes . for example , a young turaqui boy offers to show brand an enemy hideout , in exchange for money and candy . brand produces the cash but , because he has no candy , the boy burns his vehicle anyway . brilliant ! then , also , the direction is not a total success but does n't lag very often . no , if you have conservative leanings , you probably wo n't like this film one bit . but , if you have an open mind and want to see a satirical view of the `` war on terrorism '' , this is quite a good show . therefore , do make an effort to view it , as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio `` formulas '' .
goodnight mister tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realised . it is n't completely faithful to the book , but does it have to be ? no , not at all . john thaw is mesmerising as tom oakley . his transformation from gruff to caring was so well realised , making it more believable than scrooge in christmas carol . after inspector morse , this is thaw 's finest hour . he was matched earnestly by a young nick robinson , who gave a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacuee traumatised by the abusive relationship with his mother . the script and music made it worth the buy , and you also see thaw playing the organ . amazing ! the most moving scene , was willie finding out about zak 's death , and then tom telling him about his deceased family who died of scarlatina . buy this , you 'll love it ! 10/10 bethany cox
though not a horror film in the traditional sense , this creepy little film delivers the goods . it seems a vampire is loose in a small german town draining its victims of their blood . police inspector karl brettschneider , melvyn douglas in one of his early roles , is skeptical believing a crazed killer not a vampire is running amok . the only one who believes him is ruth bertin ( faye wray ) the inspector 's girlfriend and lab assistant to dr. otto von niemann ( lionel atwill ) who though apparently an eminent scientist goes along with the vampire theory . the townspeople suspect the weirdo herman gleib , played with his usual frenzy by dwight frye who seems to be having a lot of fun with his role . the film contains quite a bit of humor which helps relieve some of the intensity involved with all the murders being committed . one funny part has gussie schnappmann ( maude eburne ) , ruth bertin 's aunt , thinking weird herman has turned not into a bat but into a dog . maude eburne and dwight frye make a good comedy team . this budget movie brings in elements from `` the cabinet of dr. caligari '' with dr. niemann using the power of suggestion to make a somnambulist carry out his orders , from `` frankenstein '' by using the human blood to help create life in the laboratory , and `` dracula '' since the murders are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girl to be the work of a bloodsucker . thses elements are mixed well by director frank r. strayer with a little comedy thrown in for good measure . the concoction works . the restored version i viewed used tinting to increase the spooky atmosphere . so try to see the this version if possible .
i have n't yet read kurt vonnegut 's mother night ( though i 've read other books of his , all outstanding pieces of satire and game-changing novel pieces ) . after seeing keith gordon 's film adaptation of his book , it will be an immediate must-read in the near future . it 's the kind of material that i 'm sure if it was n't made in 1995/96 as a film , it would be picked up right away today in the time period when many period post/present-holocaust/ww2 movies are quite popular . except that this is much darker , though even more resonant , about the nature of playing roles and the real underlying horror of living with life after war than say the reader . it 's about the very real danger of pretending in wartime , which is what being a spy in ww2 is really all about . it would be one thing if mother night had a script with a lot of emotional depth and complexity about the moral choice and constant role- even after the war ends- for howard w. cambpell ( nick nolte ) , which is does . but it 's also just a really strong feat of cinematic technique . keith gordon is not someone i usually think of as a director of really strong material ( more-so i think back to him as an actor , oddly enough featured briefly with vonnegut himself in back to school ) , but this is a revelation . he takes the story of campbell as a story of a fractured life : a german propaganda master ( the `` only american left in berlin '' ) , who is actually a spy for the americans but can never have his identity revealed , and was before a playwright who really belonged to `` a nation of two '' , himself and his wife ( sheryl lee ) . it follows him from his prison cell , awaiting trial in israel in 1961 , as he writes his memoir and tells of his disillusionment about being a 'pretend ' nazi , and then in 1960 in semi-hiding in a new york apartment , which is where the bulk of the film takes place . mother night can be quite heavy , like on a level one might associate with the pianist , but on another more emotional-cerebral level than the stark poetry of that film . gordon , by way of vonnegut , is trying to give us a strong look at a man who has nothing , except the memory ( and then later a weird transposition ) of his long lost love in a `` sister '' who has come back to him in nyc , so he 's left to his own devices when he befriends a painter ( alan arkin , very very good here ) , and then is found out as a nazi-in-hiding by a white supremacist newsletter , leading wackos to his apartment . on the surface this should be just a straightforward spy story , but not a thing is straightforward . the 'something ' of this man 's life is staggering , but it 's ultimately of his own choosing . campbell is one of those characters that could be analyzed for hours on end , but the same conclusions might be reached ( and , in a way , mirrors the line goebbels said ) : the bigger the lie , the more people believe it . that is except for the select few who started the lie and know its secret and power . but oh , it would be one thing if it were just a wonderful and tragic-comic tale , or another if it were featuring some really fantastic performances ( which is does : nolte is at his very best here , and sheryl lee , who we might remember from twin peaks as laura palmer , stuns in multiple roles , especially in the scene when she reveals she 's not 'really ' helga ) . it 's also a gorgeously shot film , with brilliant lighting and shots that reflect the state of mind of the character , or just the starkness or sickening colors of the time ( watch the scene where an old campbell watches a film of his younger self spouting out a rant , the juxtaposition of faces is great ) . and the music selections rise the level of tragedy . it could be argued some of the music is too much , but at other times it elevates the material past its own usual dramatic dimensions and makes it operatic , solemn about human nature . it 's not always an easy film to take emotionally , and some of the twists do have that tinge of `` whoa '' as in any spy story . but it 's the subversion from vonnegut that sticks through , the way of taking appearance and performance , of life imitating art imitating life imitating death , and making it into something worth remembering . i have no idea just yet if the book is better than the film ( or the other way around ) , but at the moment it 's hard for me not to recommend this to anyone looking for a masterpiece of post ww2/holocaust storytelling .
for real film people , this film is a must , since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves . janos rukh/boris karloff 's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena . this light can do harm , or it can be harnessed to do good . on the one hand it blinds his mother , on the other it is used to cure blindness ( `` i can see ! '' shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected ) . when rukh/karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light , we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative , drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection , an entity viewed on film ( only visible , as in a movie theater , when the lights are out ) . there is a wonderful passage near the beginning where karloff/rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years , as the light from andromeda was emitted from that galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock . there are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles : that of the writer , in the persona of beulah bondi/arabella stevens ; and religion , emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral karloff blasts with his projector/ray gun . one has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in germany at the time , and particularly at riefenstall 's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm : triumph of the will . happily in the end , mother ( violet kemble cooper ) intervenes , reminding janos rukh of the first rule of science . if only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout : `` i can see ! ''
the caprica episode ( s01e01 ) is well done as a pilot . really , this episode is the exact same content as the dvd pilot release . that having been said , episode 01 gives a very substantive background of the very popular `` battlestar galactica '' series ( both the original and the 2007 remake ) . it significantly applies most to the 2007 series . as is the trending plots of sci-fi of late , this series explores `` virtual '' life or environment . on top of this , we are given much background on the adama family line as well as their relationship with the unrevealed ( in the battlestar galactica series ) creator of the cylons . to the most part , this first episode revolves around the popular topic of `` virtual '' life and ( as is expected ) early life of the colonies , and the birth of the cylons . over all , i rather enjoyed this episode . although , it was not new material for myself or anyone that has already seen the dvd release of the caprica pilot , the series seems very promising . as is the case with many pilots , episode 01 leaves us with a cliff-hanger so to ensure a follow by an audience ( sci-fi community ) . i 'm definitely going to keep watching for resolve as well as development . i give this series 8 stars .
this documentary makes you travel all around the globe . it contains rare and stunning sequels from the wilderness . it shows you how diversified and how fragile our planet can be . the polar bear 's future is highlighted at the beginning and at the end of it . after all , its bleak future is closely linked with the consequences of global warming . this documentary is however a simplistic approach of such a serious environmental issue . it can nonetheless be easily seen by young children since it mainly remains descriptive . scientists might well be disappointed as it is not a remake of al gore 's documentary `` an inconvenient truth '' but frankly ... what a description ! ! ! a question may then arise : is n't it worth preserving our world 's beauty ? because this documentary proves that in 2007 such a beauty still exists despite the different pollutions . by living in towns and cities we tend to forget that we are part and parcel of this nature . all things considered this documentary reminds us that we own a common treasure called `` earth '' .
of all arnold 's mid-'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be the running man . a chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality tv gone mad . it may have been far-fetched back then but not so now . not when you think about it . currently , reality tv shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar . if the next one is n't more controversial as the last , it 's a dud . how long will it be before we really do see shows like the running man ? how long before we have 'court-appointed theatrical attorneys ' or the entertainment division of the justice department ? there is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of tv shows . the biggest message of all is 'you are being lied to ' . it 's no secret that the government and the media work in cahoots . and the masses believe what the media tells them to believe . it 's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the running man in the near future . it 's no secret that reality tv is not very realistic . it 's edited and reshaped before being aired and it 's only what the networks want you to see . usually it 's far from the real truth . although rather different than stephen king 's book ( the ending is completely changed ) the script does conform to the typical arnie formula . yes , he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say ' i 'll be back ' ( which he never really said that often anyway , when you think about it ) in the most ironic situation yet but he 's still a zillion times better in the role then christopher reeve or dolph lundgren would have been ( these two were considered before arnie believe it or not ) . the director is none other than dave starsky himself ( paul michael glaser ) . it may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look . andrew davis ( not a director i particularly like ) was attached before glaser , though no matter who directs , the film is still marred by a very heavy 80 's feel . first of all , harold faltermeyer 's score ( remember him ? ) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity . and the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future . apart from the dated feel , the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax . this new dvd is a zillion times better than the original release . gone is the horrid letterbox picture . in its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer . the colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen . the new dolby 5.1 ex and dts es soundtrack are also amazing . there constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful . definitely one of the best re-masters i 've seen so far . two intriguing documentaries , a trailer and a 'meet the stalkers ' gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case .
fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of hip-hop culture . it is just as funny as this is spinal tap , if not funnier . the actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb . mark christopher lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films . this film is a true cult classic !
this made-for-tv film is a brilliant one . this is probably the best and favourite role by bafta winning john thaw ( kavanagh q.c . and inspector morse ) . tom oakley ( thaw ) widowed man has lived in a village alone for a while since his wife and son died , and now he has been landed with an evacuee called willaim beech ( nick robinson ) . as he gets to know this child he starts to develop a friendship . until willaim 's mum ( annabelle apsion ) wants him back . after tom gets worried about william not contacting him he goes to london to find him . in the end willaim gets his home with a loving family ( or dad ) . set during the second world war this is an excellent film . it was nominated the bafta lew grade award , and it won the national television award for most popular drama . john thaw was number 3 on tv 's 50 greatest stars . very good !
carla works for a property developer 's where she excels in being unattractive , unappreciated and desperate . she is also deaf . her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company . help arrives in the form of paul , a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment . an implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week . when carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits paul 's criminality by having him steal the contract back . the colleague quickly realises that she 's behind the robbery , but when he confronts her , paul 's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price . paul is given a 'going over ' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt . he formulates a plan which utilises carla 's unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers . it 's now carla 's turn to enter a frightening new world . the fourth feature from director jacques audiard , 'read my lips ' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners . the leads are excellent ; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect . carla 's first meeting with paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was , until very recently , a jailbird . emmanuelle devos , who plays carla , has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame . vincent cassel plays paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he 's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed . like many french films , 'read my lips ' appears , at first , to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it 's probably about everything . the only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of paul 's parole officer ; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac . it was the french 'new wave ' of the 60 's that first introduced the concept of 'genre ' to film making and i 've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it ; so it 's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre , or better still , defy it .
adorable ! i saw domestic import in philly in october with my kids . we all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents . i have n't heard them laugh like that in years ! it was the first time that i can remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy . it 's really cute and we ca n't wait for it to come out on dvd . they need to make more movies like domestic import . it is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy ( and not be embarrassed ) . i have not seen a movie this cute since my big fat greek wedding . i loved mindy sterling as the mother . she was also in austin powers . howard hesseman is in this too and he is hilarious . i remember him from wkrp .
four words account for why this film was made - `` she done him wrong '' . the huge commercial success of that mae west vehicle convinced the studio brass that gay '90s melodramas were a viable proposition . here we are rewarded with a fast moving , well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars . wallace beery and george raft are excellent as friendly rivals ; jackie cooper is a little harder to take , but it is fay wray who steals the film with her stock-in-trade damsel in distress . with a strong director - as walsh proves himself to be - wray could carry a lot of punch , and she is utterly believable as the object of both raft and beery 's affection . lots of atmosphere , beautifully designed , this is a forgotten film worthy of revival .
- after their sons are sentenced to life in prison , adelle ( debbie reynolds ) and helen ( shirley winters ) begin receiving threatening phone calls because someone fells their sons got off easy . the pair decides to move to california to escape the publicity of the trial and to start a new life . they start a dance school that is soon very successful . one of the students has a rich unmarried father with whom adelle quickly falls in love . in the meantime , helen is busy raising rabbits and becoming a little too infatuated with an evangelist on the radio . it 's only a mater of time before everything falls apart and the women enter a world of madness and murder . - i ca n't help but compare what 's the matter with helen ? to whoever slew auntie roo ? , also starring shelly winters . where that movie seemed almost restrained in its presentation of auntie roo 's madness , there 's nothing holding helen back in this movie . it may take a good deal of the movie 's running time , but once she snaps , helen is one bad mad mutha . you do n't want to mess with her . winters is so delightfully demented that it was impossible for me not to enjoy her performance . i 'm not going to spoil the movie , but the things helen is capable of are totally over-the-top . - as good as winters is , reynolds is totally ridiculous in her role as the gold-digging tap dancer . i got the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would get her nominated for some award . this ai n't citizen kane ! quit acting so serious . hey , debbie , do n't you realize that you 're main purpose is to be a victim of winters ' insanity . - i just love these former-female-stars-in-the-twilight-of-their-career horror movies . what 's the matter with helen ? is as fun as any .
walter matthau and george burns just work so well together . the acidity of willy with the perplexed amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven . the scene when they meet again in willy 's flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection . walter matthau gives a superb performance as the irascible semi-retired comedian as only he can , the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization . george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film , his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable . watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker , and al 's reaction - priceless .
i drove from sacramento to san francisco ( and back ) to see this movie premiere -- and really glad i did . as a big movie fan and a life-long northern californian , i was surprised how many oscar-winning films have been made in the bay area . as a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the bay area as opposed to going to la , george lucas ' comments about persistence , community and having a vision really resonated with me . hey , if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in sf , so can other artists . would recommend this film
this is a haunting , powerful italian adaptation of james m. cain 's novel the postman always rings twice directed by the great luchino visconti . what is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it 's source material to become something bolder and more original ( interestingly camus also credits cain 's novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel the stranger ) . the film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of cain 's narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender . cain 's very american novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness ( the lead character cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a mexican and embarrassed that she married a greek immigrant ) , which is not relevant to the italian rural context that visconti is working in . this allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate , doomed love affair of the two main characters . this film is a complex , suspenseful , rewarding experience .
linking story : another first-time viewing for me and , again , this is one of the most popular of the amicus anthologies - and it 's easy to see why , though i realize how the film 's rather meaningless title could be misleading for some ; i certainly fancied director peter duffell 's choice - death and the maiden ( which , incidentally , is a classical piece by schubert that is heard in the film during the peter cushing episode ) - a great deal more . though the linking device itself is not all that great , the episodes are all equally compelling and enjoyable . production values come off as very respectable indeed for the budget duffell had to work with . the latter infuses the film with a great deal of style which is not so common with this type of film and , frankly , it makes one regret the fact that he wished to distance himself from the genre ( though more so as not to be typecast rather than because he felt it was beneath him ) . now to the individual stories themselves : `` method for murder '' : the opening segment does not offer any real surprises but , to make up for this , it 's quietly suspenseful and appropriately creepy at times ( tom adams ' 'fictitious ' villain looking like the long-lost brother of boris karloff from the old dark house [ 1932 ] ) ; also , it ends with a satisfactory diabolique-type twist , and features a fairly intense role for denholm elliott in the lead . that 's all we need out of it , really . `` waxworks '' : for the second story we are introduced to a curiously romantic mood which is quite unusual for this type of film ; peter cushing and joss ackland are both excellent ( as well as impeccably dressed ) in their roles of two jilted lovers of a woman who continues to obsess them even after such a long time , and whose friendly rivalry can only lead them blindly and inexorably to a fate that is literally worse than death ; an ominous hallucination scene with peter cushing is quite well done in view of the limited resources at hand , and ackland 's inexplicable inability - or unwillingness - to leave town somewhat recalls the house-trapped aristocrats of bunuel 's the exterminating angel ( 1962 ) . `` sweets to the sweet '' : this is perhaps the finest episode of all - with his ambiguous role here , christopher lee continues to demonstrate his versatility and he is matched by an understanding nyree dawn porter and the deceptive innocence of chloe franks ( who appears as lee 's daughter ) . the film 's treatment of the occult here is both subtle and mature , culminating in a powerful and extremely chilling 'curtain ' . trivia note : chloe franks appears as a grown-up in the featurette included on the disc , and when i saw her i felt an immediate familiarity with her face but could n't quite put my finger on it . later , on reading her filmography , it was revealed to me that she had played one of the leads in the long-running stage adaptation of agatha christie 's `` the mousetrap '' in london 's west end , which my brother and i were fortunate enough to catch while we there on holiday in the summer of 2002 ! needless to say , we had no idea then that she had once created such a delicate - and delicious - portrayal in sheer evil , mainly by virtue of her peculiar look and a devilish smile ! ! `` the cloak '' : a wacky but oddly reverent vampire tale ( that still manages to debunk many of the myths attached to the subgenre , while inventing some new ones ! ) which takes in some wonderful digs at exploitation cinema and , at one point , christopher lee himself ! ; jon pertwee is marvelous as the campy horror star who gets more than he bargained for when he attempts to bring a measure of authenticity to his work ; ingrid pitt sends up her image nicely though her role is somewhat subsidiary to the proceedings ; geoffrey bayldon ( made up to look like ernest thesiger ) also has a memorably quirky bit ; the 'silent-cinema ' style of the ending was a pretty audacious one to pull on an audience , i suppose - and , while some of the humor comes off as heavy-handed a ' la the fearless vampire killers ( 1967 ) or theatre of blood ( 1973 ) , it 's also rather infectious and certainly ends the film on a high ( and highly unusual ) note ! video and audio quality are relatively satisfactory , considering i had no other version to compare it with ; the main culprit is some noticeable print damage but this is never so nasty as to affect one 's enjoyment of the film . as for the extras , beginning with the audio commentary : frankly , this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that i can remember listening to ; jonathan rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director peter duffell to touch on every aspect of the production ( whereas with some other films , you 're left rather expecting there to be more ! ) and , as such , it 's an extremely pleasant track that complements the main feature very nicely indeed . the featurette `` a-rated horror film '' is a worthwhile effort with peter duffell again at center-stage but this time backed up with valid , if all-too-brief , contributions from producer max j. rosenberg and stars chloe franks , ingrid pitt and geoffrey bayldon . we also get film notes , reviews , bios and a poster/stills gallery which , again , are wonderfully assembled ( with the contemporary reviews being something of a novelty - and a welcome one at that ) .
i thought this was a quiet good movie . it was fun to watch it . what i liked best where the 'outtakes ' at the end of the movie . they were great .
i got to see this just this last friday at the los angeles film festival at laemlee 's on beverly . this movie got the most applause of all the films that evening . considering that two music videos opened first , i did n't know what to expect since they were very fast and attention grabbing , i was n't sure i was ready for a short immediately . but to my surprise i really enjoyed this . i thought the main actor demon guy was really good . i was so impressed with his performance that i checked out his name . i was surprised to see that this was the witchblade guy . he 's gotten really good especially since then ! either that or he was given lousy roles or had been pushed by the director really hard for this short . the girl did an okay job . i guess its hard since it was her first performance and being so young . the dad did well also . there was a lot of really nice cg work for a short , both for this and the short playing next `` mexican hat '' which was also nice , but i enjoyed this the most because it had the most depth and emotion and i actually cared about the characters . the other was a very simple story . the story was quite illustrative and dark ! it dealt with real topics using a more fantasy like approach to keep add people like me interested . we wo n't even talk about the last film in the block which i left . my only complaint is that i only wish i had seen more of the demon character and a little less of getting started , which is why i gave it a 9 out of 10 . i also thought the end credits went a little slowly . otherwise it was beautifully told , directed and edited . the timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast mtv editing done on everything nowadays . there will be more coming from this director in the future as well as the actor . i now will think of him as the sorrows lost actor not the witchblade guy .
spoiler for anyone who is lucky enough to ever see this film ( so not really spoiler after all ) . saw this film when it was released and can still remember parts of it . it 's all set in a small town in the west or what is left of that town . it more resembles a ghost town with few inhabitants . among them a couple , where the wife is especially wicked . she lets her man die in the end of the film and leaves the town but has to cross the desert . we never know what happens to her next but just before she left her dying man shoots after her and deliberately does not hit her and instead the water supply . she is not aware of that soon she will be very thirsty . mark damon kills a couple of bad guys in a funny manor - but that 's another story , which i do n't remember too good . the remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first times i saw a really wicked woman on film , who pretends to be anything but wicked - ca n't be compared with the witch in 'snowwhite ' , who , in comparison is easy to find out . very tight western with few main characters and still absorbing .
this is one a most famous movies of the french sexual empowerment of the seventies , starring gerard depardieu and patrick dewaere in extremely sarcastic roles . it is also one of the many dark psychological dramas of the seventies/eighties , such as `` serie noire '' , `` buffet froid '' , `` beau pere '' , all realized by blier . however , i would like to correct the previous comment that was posted on the movie : the translated title in english is very far from the french version . it is true that both protagonists are `` going places '' , but the title in french could be literally translated by `` the waltz dancers '' , which is a metaphor for the movement of the testicles ...
is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story ? maybe , hell , you know how the formula works by now , pretty woman is introduced in to a picture , someone has to fall in love with her . i think this film does follow some typical story lines , but that does n't say anything about the content . there are great scenes with crispen glover , dennis hopper , and gary busey , although short . some things did n't make sense , such as the need to get in to random fights , but it is entertaining to watch , the fights were actually well done . this is definitely a comedy foremost , but it does have a lot of good feel to it . the humor is well balanced , you wo n't hurt your stomach on this , but you will keep a smile . there is a little bit of steamy action , so not one for the kids .
hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film . the plot of the film , involving two boxers fighting over a girl , is straight-forward drama without much to recommend it . hitchcock 's talent , though , is found in his stunning use of images . nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols . especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer . he slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement hitch has shown us all we need to know . the boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point-of-view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time hitchcock was . the film also gives insight into his later treatment of women . the object of the boxers ' desires is driven by money and lust , not reason or love . the only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships . all in all , the ring is a must for anyone interested in hitchcock 's early work and his development as a visual storyteller .
in ten words or less to describe this film , barbara stanwyck is too appealing and it is great ! the film is wonderful , except for the perhaps tacked-on ending , but i love happy endings anyway . barbara stanwyck , however , as the platinum-blonde gold-digger is amazing . she knows what she wants and goes after it ! this film is sexy and excellent !
michael is king . this film contains some of the best stuff mike has ever done . smooth criminal is pure genius . the cameos are wonderful , but as always , the main event is mj himself . he is the best , hands down .
a sentimental story with a sentimental sound track . it 's about a little girl ( with a voice impediment ) who treasures her green parrot paulie . the parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion . the parrot is definitely the star of the film . at times mischievous and at times in fits of depression the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way . the synchronised voice too is very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists . early in the film her father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of paulie 's constant struggle over many years to be re-united with his mistress . one of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic teller machines . paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory . the ending is predictable , but who would want it otherwise . children will love this film and anybody who keeps a bird as a pet will delight in paulie 's antics .
i loved the idea of this film from the moment i first saw a trailer for it . einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the kindly , playful , slightly mad genius was enough to get me to see the film . the added spice of matthau as einstein made it even better . the story is pure fantasy , but a delightful one . an auto mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman , who happens to be einstein 's niece . with the help of four fairy godfathers of physics , ed embarks on a quest to win catherine 's heart . throw a jealous fiancé ( who exemplifies the worst of experimental psychology ) and eisenhower into the mix , and you have pure fun . the film is filled with great character actors and delightfully sweet and daffy performances . walter matthau play einstein as a mischievous imp ; cupid with a slide rule . tim robbins is wonderfully endearing as ed and meg ryan plays a step above her normal rom-com level . stephen fry is a joy as the `` rrratman '' and ryan 's fiancé ; who lacks a single romantic bone in his body . the film fell below most radars , but is a delightful treasure that does not grow stale with repeated viewings . it features first-rate writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than gentle world .
having not seen the films before ( and not being able to stand matt damon ) , i was reluctant to go see the bourne ultimatum when we were asked to see it for as film studies . however , i was pleasantly surprised that even a film with damon in it could be enjoyable . fast fight scenes , crazy motorbike chases and big explosions were what threw you out of your seat in tbu . the near-misses between the cia and bourne kept you on your toes and throughly entertained . nevertheless , several things really grated my cheese . firstly , the fact that the film was just a series of bourne , cia , bourne , cia , bourne , cia . this sequence got repetitive and ultimately dull . although damon did keep us entertained and seemed always one step ahead of the cia , i was getting a bit annoyed with the constant survival of bourne . he crashed a car and got out as if he had tapped it or something ! very unrealistic . and secondly ( inevitably ) - the shaky camera . it was so shaky it was completely noticeable and made me and everyone who went to see it in my class ( even the tutors ) seasick . we were told by the tutors that if we ever used that in a film we made in class , it would automatically be wrong and we would be told to use a tripod . fair enough if greengrass wanted it to look like we were there watching damon and stiles holding a conversation , but surely we would n't be shaking our heads that violently ! but all in all tbu is an enjoyable film and worth a watch . but i did n't think it was the best film of the year , despite being an entertaining piece of cinema . 8/10 .
director/star clint eastwood 's `` sudden impact '' is an intriguing addition to the `` dirty harry '' series - a combination of crude film-making and genius . it 's mediocre and silly in parts , brilliant and classic in others , with compelling , gripping pacing . there are numerous echoes of the first film here - the shoot 'em up `` make my day '' scene recalls the `` do you feel lucky '' one , one of the villains is as viscerally repugnant as the first film 's scorpio , an actor who played a minor baddie in the first one returns here as harry 's partner - just to name a few . harry callahan is still at odds with the higher-ups in the department , still mean , still tough , but now he 's older and wearier . his constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict - a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice , the two things not always being compatible . this `` incompatibility '' is the underlying theme of the series . the first film posed a simple question , `` what about the victim 's rights ? '' - ( do they outweigh those of the criminal ? vice versa ? depends ? ) . that film 's answer was controversial , prompting a sequel ( the highly enjoyable `` magnum force '' ) which set out to draw the line between harry 's brand of justice and pure , heartless vigilantism . dirty harry , like many of clint 's other roles , is the personification of vengeance , the protector of the the defenseless . this movie however brings it back to the victim , in this case jennifer ( portrayed by sondra locke ) , who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now-incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men ( and one woman ) who committed the crime . without going into a play-by-play of the whole movie , i will say this - i mentioned earlier that `` sudden impact '' echoes the first film - it actually also sprinkles in little references and in-jokes from the whole series ( the confusion concerning the captain 's last name is an example - an intentional prank , i believe ) . the relationship between callahan and jennifer is neat - has our rogue cop hero found a soul-mate in this lady vigilante ? and is she a vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister 's tarnished rights ? the exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series , one which i personally ( as a fan ) found quite moving . that last scene alone makes sudden impact the legitimate climax to the `` dirty harry '' collection , the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film . ( not to knock `` the dead pool '' - that excellent movie was a relatively light-hearted suspenseful yet comic thriller featuring harry callahan , rather than a character-defining film like this one ) . this movie did well in the theaters - audiences in the reagan era found harry and his ilk quite appealing , and the president himself frequently quoted `` go ahead , make my day . ''
this movie is a ripoff of james cain 's novel , the postman always rings twice . apparently , the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story -- perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the italians in wwii might account for their forgetting to consider royalties ! despite this , the movie is n't really just an italian version of the hollywood movie . in some ways it 's a lot better and in other ways , it is definitely not . the three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people . in fact , the male and female lovers are a bit icky-looking . the male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair ( particularly on the back and shoulders ) and his lady love is , to put it frankly , unattractive . they are a very , very far cry from lana turner and john garfield in the hollywood version . and the ill-fated husband is really , really obese and loves to walk around shirtless -- and his counterpart in the american film , cecil kellaway is definitely better looking ( and probably better looking than the other two italian leads , actually ) . and this unattractiveness is generally a reason i actually preferred the italian film -- since i just could not imagine a finely coiffed `` dish '' like lana turner in the middle of nowhere married to kellaway -- i am 100 % sure she would have had dozens of better offers ! whereas , the italian wife frankly might not have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable . part of the italian film 's believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex . the sanitized american film tries to make you believe that although turner and garfield kill kellaway , they never actually get around to sex ! this is pretty silly and totally unrealistic . in addition to the casual sexuality of the film , it 's also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life -- with lots of sweaty people , a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath . the movie is also pretty fast-paced compared to the over-long american film . and what you get due to brevity is n't all good . the film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the american film -- with grainier footage , relatively poor orchestration and sets . it sure ai n't a pretty film , but the neo-realistic-like style makes the film seem more realistic . but it can not make up for the short-cuts in the plot . many of the plot elements in the later american version are either missing entirely or glossed over . and the ending seems a lot less interesting than the american film -- and misses the entire human nature dilemma when turner and garfield turn on each other like rats ( the best part of the american film ) . so which is the better film ? well , a lot of this probably depends on you . as for me , the warner brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic ( though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles ) -- but it packed a great ending . and the italian film was much , much more realistic -- until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed . so neither film is exactly great , but i 'd give my nod to the italian one being a bit better . it 's too bad they could n't have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film .
i 'm grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once-moribund visayan film understorey . `` panaghoy '' is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular ( that claims more speakers than tagalog ) . the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines . downside : the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist . the other item that i did n't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the `` period '' costume of the same character , and above all , his bright red kit-car that i suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster . without those small yet glaring details , `` panaghoy '' would 've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating -- daghang salamat , manoy cesar ! addendum : this film sure beats peque gallaga 's `` oro , plata , mata '' , which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war . alos , there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg 's `` the color purple '' and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of `` noli me tangere '' .
this film is stunningly beautiful . goldsworthy 's art really benefits with the medium of film because you can see the art at its most beautiful , moving and changing and blossoming . i strongly recommend this movie to everyone . i can think of nothing else to say about it . it 's just the kind of movie you have to see , because it 's so visually compelling and left me very refreshed when i left the theatre .
an absolutely brilliant show . the second season began where the first ended , with much mystery . suspense in most , if not all episodes and mystery everywhere . one that made me think and think again . it 's truly amazing how the writer can come out with all the connections and link all the characters together and combine all these elements to make the lives of the characters in the show so meaningful . never fail to excites and i am looking forward to the new season . hopefully more secrets will be reveal and at the same time , more mystery to be solved . good selection of cast too for this show , fit the characters perfectly . really ca n't wait to finally discover the secret . hopefully all the hype wo n't spoil the ending .
there is no such a thing as perfect murder.lieutenant columbo knows that.ken franklin , who is the other half of the writing team of detective stories does n't know that.he kills his partner jim ferris who had plans on going solo.now columbo steps into the picture and asks all sorts of questions from mr. franklin.and returns for one more question.columbo : murder by the book ( 1971 ) is directed by the young steven spielberg before his days of fame.steven bochco wrote it.columbo is a fantastic character with his shabby look.it 's hard to believe this man could solve any crime.but he could.each and every one of them ! peter falk is the one and only person in the world that could portray this character.so no remakes , please.this part is a very good example of how columbo worked.jack cassidy plays the murderer and martin milner plays the victim.rosemary forsyth plays the victim 's wife joanna ferris.there 's something endearing in the scenes between columbo and her.how he makes the omelet and everything.barbara colby plays lilly la sanka.she actually met a tragic fate when she died after a homicide like she does here.i 've been a fan of columbo since childhood and i still enjoy watching them.there was a break for many years that they were n't showing columbo stories at all but now he 's back.back for one more question .
i wo n't claim to be a fan of ralph bakshi , because i am not . i have only watched 5 of his animated films so far : coonskin , wizards , fritz the cat and lord of the rings and finally `` fire and ice '' . what i can claim , is that i found `` fire and ice '' to be the most enjoyable of the lot . it is a straightforward fantasy tale of swords and sorcery along the lines of conan the barbarian , but the beautiful artwork , realistic animation and lively film score effectively lends a very classic charm to this movie . deserving first mention , is the animation itself . i do not care what people say about rotoscoping but in my opinion ralph bakshi used that technique very effectively here . i was amazed at how realistic the movements of the characters were . the style of directing and the photo-realistic character designs made `` fire and ice '' feel more like a big budget fantasy blockbuster than a cartoon . sadly the level of art detail tends to get a little inconsistent , especially near the end of the movie . some scenes just look really flat with little to no body contour details or fabric folds and shadows on the characters . with realistic moving characters , realistic action would naturally follow . not only was the action well choreographed , but it was really brutal . i would be so bold as to compare the brutality of the action to live action movies like zack snyder 's 300 . i did notice however that though there was blood shed , the blood splatters were kept to a minimum . again , a great choice by the creative team that only heightens the viewing experience by not taking things too `` over the top '' . though i do not recognize any `` big names '' in the cast , the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfying performance ; keeping the delivery of every line realistically subdued and only hamming it up in the case of the bad guys . did i say bad guys ? ? yes i did . because that is exactly what the story is about , a standard good vs evil tale . nothing really original about the story which seems to merely be a mix of pre-existing fantasy film clichés that involve scantly clad warriors and maidens . anyone looking for `` depth '' would be sorely disappointed . the characters are not given much development and some of them like nekron and darkwolf are one dimensional at best ( i did however hear rumor of some deleted scenes that explains darkwolf 's obsession with killing nekron and his mother . scenes like that deserved full restoration and should have been included in the final cut to add a level of depth to the show ) . in fact , i would not be surprised to find out that the whole movie was just a `` tech demo '' of sorts to showcase the awesome animation and art , with the story cobbled together and thrown in as an afterthought in order to pass it off as a proper `` movie '' . a true classic of a bygone era , `` fire and ice '' really captures the blazing spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful renderings of fantastic creatures and charming characters . it is a unique vision of a world created by ralph bakshi and artist frank frazetta with a good measure of action and suspense . would it hold up to animated film standards of today ? definitely not . but i urge animation fans in general to `` get off your high horse '' and give this simple but beautiful film a chance to grow on you . it is truly a gem of the 80s worth checking out .
the house that dripped blood is the third in a series of seven amicus horror anthologies . if the monster club is included as part of the series , this would make eight movies . although , that movie is very different from the others . i look upon the amicus anthologies with great memories as i used to love them when i was in my teens . my feelings for them today are just as strong . i spent many years trying to track down this movie . the synopses of the stories was so appealing that i went as far as paying a substantial amount for it when i eventually found a copy . as great as though the movie is , i did feel a sense of disappointment when i finally saw it . it was n't quite as good as i was led to believe . whilst better than its two predecessors , it 's nowhere near as good as its four successors as i shall demonstrate . the linking story sees john bennett as a police inspector tracking down a missing person who lives in a mysterious old house . his journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous occupants . the linking story later sees him visiting the estate agent who sold the house . whilst this linking story seems enticing on paper , it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the weakest of any amicus anthology . i could n't help but get the feeling that john bennett is a poor man 's version of donald pleasance or ian hendry . i would much rather have seen one of the two aforementioned actors in his role . we could have even had both here - one as the police inspector and another as the estate agent . they could , and i believe would , have brought this weak element of the movie to life much better . the movie contains four stories , each of which focuses on an inhabitant of the house . the first story sees denholm elliott as a writer of crime stories . he is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler , even going as far as drawing a sketch to aid his writing . soon after , he begins seeing visions of his own creation . some excellent direction by peter duffell , particularly with the choice of camera angles helps to detract from the restrained script . elliott 's performance is superb as the tormented writer and he also helps to elevate the story . the story ends with a semi-twist but i could n't help get the sense of a script which did n't allow it to live up to its potential . the second story sees peter cushing move into the house . he is a lonely man who is still pining for a beautiful young woman who once jilted him and who he keeps a picture of . cushing 's performance really brings this emotionally-moving story to life . he is helped by the director who chooses to include continual focus on cushing 's loneliness . this is taken further with a great hallucination scene that helps us to see inside cushing 's mind . anyway , cushing sees a figure at a nearby wax museum that looks just like his girl . naturally his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist at the end . joss ackland plays cushing 's rival but his performance is massively overshadowed by the late great peter cushing . the third story and easily the best sees christopher lee - my favourite horror actor of all time - move into the house with his daughter . mr. lee gives one his perfect ice cold performances here . he shows no love or attention for his daughter at all . he even brings in a school governess to educate her . the governess , played by nyree dawn porter in another of her superb performances , tries to find out what is wrong . without giving too much away , i can reveal that witchcraft plays a role . christopher lee 's presence is truly electrifying in every scene he 's in . chloe franks deserves special recognition for her massively underrated performance as the little girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie . the movie is worth seeing even for the sake of seeing just this one story . the final story is played almost entirely for laughs but it certainly does entertain and that 's what matters . jon pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves into the house . he is very dissatisfied at the approach his producers take to movies , seeing everything as cheap and fake , particularly the costumes . so he decides to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire role . geoffrey bayldon has an excellent cameo as a dealer who sells pertwee an ancient cloak . when pertwee puts the cloak on , he starts developing fangs and basically transforming into a vampire . pertwee 's performance has to be seen to be believed . it truly is hilarious . ingrid pitt is also in this story but her talent is wasted in a role that should have been much larger . the linking story finishes with a loose connection to the final story . this is particularly fitting since the inspector was looking for pertwee and naturally decides to visit the house . the rest you 'll be able to work out for yourself . as weak as the linking story is , it does have a decent if somewhat unintentionally comical ending . i 'm convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what should have been a truly magnificent movie does n't lie with peter duffell , the director , who really does his best with what he 's got . i think the script was just too restrained and lacking the ambition that can be found in the four later movies . overall , the house that dripped blood , despite its flaws is a must-see for fans of the amicus anthologies , fans of other amicus movies or fans of portmanteau horror movies . if my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes , check it out . you 'll enjoy it !
first of all i saw this movie without knowing anything about it i just knew that joel schumacher did it and that was enough for me . a friend and i went to see it at a danish film festival called the night-film festival which is a lot of different movies shown after hours the festival pretty much specializes in showing movies that would n't otherwise be shown in danish theaters . anyway my friend and i went to see it and we were astonished at how real it seemed and that it really struck a cord with our feelings , we really got caught up in the plot without being able to figure out the ending which is a great plus in our book . the film is recorded in a style that reminds me of the danish initiative `` dogma 95 '' which was started by 4 danish directors including lars von trier ( dancer in the dark ) . in conclusion the movie is really worth seeing it gives a different perspective on how things were for the american g.i . joe coming out of school being expected to serve their country in battle a long way from home . also colin farrell is exceptional in this movie i have n't seen him before but i ca n't wait to see more of him . lars p. helvard
frailty is a non-gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man 's delusion/obsession straight into depravity . dad ( we never learn his name ) is a gentle man and loving father who 's raising his sons alone after mom died giving birth to the youngest son , adam . the family 's world flips upside down late one night when dad rushes into the boys ' room and tells them god has given him a vision . and what a vision  the entire family 's job is to destroy demons , who , of course , are disguised in human form . proceeding from this premise , the movie is unflinching in following it . dad kidnaps people/demons whom god has told him to destroy , binds them , lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil , then kills them  while making his young sons watch . fenton , the older boy , is horrified , seeing only a father who 's turned into a crazed murderer . adam , the younger , is uncomfortable , but trusts that dad is following god 's will . eventually , dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the `` demons '' that god has put on dad 's list , and finally , invites them to fully participate in god 's mission for the family . this is not , you understand , an abusive father . he loves his children . he is only following god 's instructions : `` this is our job now , son . we 've got to do this . '' when fenton , terrified and convinced his father has gone mad , says he 'll report him to the police , his father explains , `` if you do that , son , i 'll die . the angel was clear on this . '' the pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic , and warps their entire lives . ( 1 ) the movie 's structure is similar to the one used in the usual suspects : a story in flashback , told in a police station to a fbi agent . the moody lighting , the stormy weather , and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory . i wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story , until i remembered the real-life parallel of andrea yates , who believed she was possessed by satan and could save her children by drowning them . even then , i wanted to believe that i was watching a human tragedy , rather than a story of divine retribution . the movie gave me no such comfort , though , as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of dad 's vision . and this , as much as some plot holes , posed a problem for me . regardless of the accuracy of dad 's visions , regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed , where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death ?

who would 've imagined -- hal hartley creates a filmic corollary to syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style . the fusion is highly entertaining . having not seen a hal hartley film for about a decade , i approached this one with some caution . his brilliant productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog . the director 's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of long island , new york or in new york city itself -- that were offbeat and insightful . my initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a `` spy thriller '' . to my pleasant surprise , hartley manages to mesh his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue . it works in more ways than one might imagine . hartley 's film retains the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks , along with a singular cinematographic style . moreover it is highly appropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides . hartley has brought all his skills to something new -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as syriana . truly he is coming into his own . the cast does a fine job of interpreting hartley 's vision and style . fans of parker posey will see her in full bloom here , still with us and more ripe and gorgeous than before .
most folks might say that if one were to spend a saturday night watching a movie , you must be really bored . actually , i had just gotten back home from being out and turned on the tv and there it was , '' paulie '' . i had missed the opening credits , so i did n't know the name of it but i saw that it had cheech marin in it , so i naturally thought i had tuned into `` born in east l.a. '' when i saw him talking to a talking parrot , i was ready to dismiss this as the kind of flop movie they show late in the night . happy to say , it was better than that . as you know , if you do n't already paulie is lost and trying to get back to his original owner . seems it 's taken years to find her . what should be paulie 's advantage is actually a dis-advantage in ways . people come across a literate parrot and all they see is a way to make money or benefit themselves . while cheech marin 's character `` is '' making money from him , he 's not mean to him . the dance sequences with the parrots are something kids will find cute , i found them amusing . paulie , who 's naive ' , learns quickly that not all humans are nice people . especially the owner of an animal research lab . the man lies to him saying he 'll help him find his owner as long as he helps in his animal communications research . paulie is now stuck but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration to others of paulie 's vocal ability . throughout the film paulie 's telling his story to the facilities janitor who ends up freeing him , several other animals and finding the location of paulie 's owner . it 's a touching reunion . 8 out of 10 , the wing clipping scene should have been assumed and not shown . that part might bother younger children . otherwise , it 's a great movie for older kids and adults who are a kid at heart .

released in december of 1957 , sayonara went on to earn 8 oscar nominations and would pull in 4 wins . red buttons won the oscar for best supporting actor in his role as airman joe kelly who falls in love with a japanese woman while stationed in kobe during the korean war . oscar nominated for best leading actor , marlon brando plays major lloyd gruver , a korean war flying ace reassigned to japan , who staunchly supports the military 's opposition to marriages between american troops and japanese women and tries without any success to talk his friend joe kelly out of getting married . ironically marlon brandos character soon finds love of his own in a woman of japanese descent . this movie highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of that time . filmed in beautiful color and with stunning backgrounds i found this movie to be well worth watching just for these effects alone . good movie , gim me more ... gimmeclassics
faith and mortality ... viewed through the lens of an elderly ashkenazi jewish-american gentleman and a younger , african-american jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the years .. mostel 's character is a tailor with chronic back problems , and a terminally ill wife ; belafonte 's character is a career hustler , never settling on a regular job , and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd purgatory -- he must convince mostel to renew his faith , as it has been failing along with his wife 's health ( and his own ) .. but belafonte 's levine has his own problems , still pining for the girlfriend he left behind .. belafonte 's character leaves the film before he seemingly should , and so the the ending is cryptic , and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending .. this is not a 'typical ' hollywood movie on ethnic relations or about a person 's crisis of faith .. it is worth watching more than once and appreciating the excellent performances of the principal actors ..
this movie has made me want to become a director , and michelle rodriguez is brilliant . how the hell was n't she on mtv 's top 25 under 25 , she beats them all . this film definitely deserved the grand jury prize at sundance , best film i have ever seen .
my all-time favorite movie . oscar-caliber work by everyone involved , both in front of and behind the camera . the screenplay is perfect , and works out the relationship between lady caroline and george briggs in a completely satisfying way , unlike the novel . the care with which the other leading characters have been drawn is a tribute to screen writer peter barnes , and the intense visual beauty should have won oscars for director mike newell and cinematographer rex maidment . it is josie lawrence 's best work by far , and transformed my opinion of joan plowright . having watched this movie at least 50 times , i can find no fault in it . the music , by famed composer richard rodney bennet is a marvel .
this movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective , so i was hooked by the time the title came on . the theme of this movie is that everyone is acting , trying to re-invent themselves , but not in a tricky way like identity or the usual suspects , but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting . the scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular . at one point jorgen ( who owns the chicken farm ) attends a seminar in laughing , where he 's the worst student . his discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself . the movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people i see every day . there 's not a lot of plot here . guessing the old man 's secret is pretty easy , but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out . this movie appealed to me in the same way that sideways did , although the characters could n't be more dissimilar .
there is so much of worth in this movie that it is hard to know where to begin with praise . let me begin by expressing my admiration for a perfect portrayal by reese witherspoon . that her performance stands out in the excellent cast is praise indeed . robert mulligan has seldom disappointed those of us who have admired his work . every frame of the man in the moon is evidence of film making at its best .
wow ! what - a - movie ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i 'm not at all a fan of contemporary italian directors . usually i do n't like dramas . i am not a will smith super fan even thinking that he is a very good actor ...... but this movie ! it is such a great movie with a such original script and so good direction and so well acting ... wow ... it is stunning . this movie captured my attention minute by minute and i even did not like `` the pursuit of happiness '' ( maybe also because i did not like the acting of will 's son who is a very bad actor while children usually seems all natural born actors , i saw him also last night in `` the day the earth stood still '' and i confirmed my sensation that jaden ca n't act ) . i do n't want to write spoilers and so i do n't talk about the story but what i can say is that this movie talks about love , death and other feelings which i do n't like to watch in movies .... but this movie is such a super great movie . if you have a minimum of heart you 'll do n't regret watching it
so your bairns are away on a sleep-over ? the wife is visiting the mother in law ? you though are at home . it 's a dark and stormy night and there is no football on the telly and the dishwasher needs stacking ? so now what are you going to do ? i will tell you ! go make an old fashioned cocoa ( frys is best ! ) get hold of some ginger nuts and sit down in front of the dvd . now go select and play arthur askeys world war two thriller/horror the ghost train , return to that comfortable settee and enjoy the night in ! the ghost train is a genuine british war time classic ! arthur askey with his side kick , stinker murdoch , entertain you and i suspect the cast , to a high octane , thrills and spills , espionage thriller.it 's set in old rural england during the second world war . it centres around a motley group of people that need to stay overnight , through circumstances outside any ones ' control , in an old railway waiting room that they discover is haunted by an old train . the plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit to the entire cast it is humorous in parts and at times genuinely scary ! ( the tale was written by that old boy godfrey of dads army fame and it is clever ) arthur askey is entertaining and is very at home preforming his routines to you and the cast , he also shows he can act a bit ! the cast are never out staged though , even the railway porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas . oh and when it ends please remember to stack the dish washer !
as someone who was born to a german mother and english father ( who spent five years in a prisoner of war camp ) i come from unique position . one of having to deal with the various nazis on one side of the family and the victors of ww2 on the other . this miniseries can not delve into every single part of hitler 's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation at the time and as best as one can hitler 's state of mind . in this the series does quite well . carlyle is very good as is o'toole , i would however liked to have got more information on the relationships with others in party because hitler did not do anything on his own . he had people around him that followed him to the letter often without question and certainly without question later on in his murderous career . what was going through goebbels , goring and hess 's mind ? it would have been helpful to see more of these relationships . but i hope it will make people research the subject more . it might also make people understand why someone like saddam hussein can not be allowed to continue in power .
these two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive . this is definitely a movie about survival , but not without it 's touching moments . the finest piece of work i have seen documenting the 9/11/01 tragedy of new york city .
this is a really well made movie . sumitra bhave has always made sensible cinema and this is my favourite film by her . this movie should have won the national award and would have been my pick to represent india at the oscars . it is at least a thousand times better than 'shaaws ' , which is going to the oscars , from india , this year . it is such a pity that the information about this ( and all other indian movies ) on imdb is lacking and sometimes even wrong . sadashiv amrapurkar played a very important character in this movie and he is not even credited on these pages . the rest of the cast and crew too are not mentioned at all . awards and nominations for this movie are not given even when sonali kulkarni won the indian national award for this movie . there was not even a single vote cast for 'doghi ' . 'doghi ' is not a hindi movie . it is marathi , and thankfully escapes the song and dance sequence , does not get tangled up in glitzy glamour and half-witted designer ware . it is a real life , soulful story that is made with a rare understanding and respect . 'doghi ' which can roughly be translated as 'two women ' is a story of two sisters , gauri and krishna . it is actually a very simple story , sumitra bhave does not venture into many sub plots , and that makes it a very difficult film to direct . the entire movie is set in a non-descript remote village in maharashtra and the screen rarely ventures far from the house of the two female protagonists . no aesthetic sunsets in this one . the movie opens and we are introduced to the entire house , which is preparing for gauri 's wedding . gauri and krishna 's father being a hard working farmer , the house is full and happy ; there is nothing wanting in their simple lives . however on the eve of the wedding gauri 's to-be-husband meets with a fatal accident . gauri 's father can not bear the tragic news and suffers a major stroke . without a strong , working member the house could have fallen apart but gauri 's mother shoulders the responsibility . she works as and when she can , but can not make ends meet . but her life still , is easier than gauri 's . superstitions , that people half-heartedly try to forget , make gauri an evil luck bringer . she is outcast from the society . gauri 's mother writes to her brother . desperate for help she accepts his suggestion . he takes gauri off to mumbai where she is made to work in brothels . gauri sends home the money she earns and their conditions improve . gauri gives her life for that of her family 's . however when gauri returns home for krishna 's wedding , her mother does not come out to meet her . she does not allow krishna near her and does not allow gauri in front of the guests . she loves gauri but fears for krishna 's life . this breaks gauri completely and she decides to return to her unfortunate life . but krishna runs out and holds gauri . she begs her beloved sister to return . krishna promises to stand by her . promises that they would face the world  together . there is nothing that is not required in this movie . everything is necessary and sufficient . gauri goes off to mumbai but what she does there is never told  the subtle dialogues tell us what there is to know . it just the bare story , which is profound in its simplicity . 'doghi ' is responsible cinema . it is respectful to the subject it handles . it is respectful towards its audience  it does not think them to have the mental capability of a four year old . the acting is first rate . the direction is marvelous  the silences carry the story forward in a way , no words could have . the script is well researched . anyone who appreciates good cinema is bound to like 'doghi ' .
a dying kung fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned poison clan.he is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them the master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good . the earlier students were all taught in a different style snake , centipede , scorpion , lizard , toad , while the last student was taught a little in each style . all of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money , and soon everyone is battling to get the money . classic martial arts film has title that even many non-fans know . i 've spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head . its a very good movie , though i 'm not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the shaw studio ( one armed swordmen or the brave archer series for example ) . this is n't to sell the film short , its not , since the film is structured like a mystery , our hero has no clue who anyone is and the venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is . we 're given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is . the film is also odd in that for a martial arts film , other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money , there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes . its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention . ( the film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film i think i 've ever seen where there are no women . i do n't think one has a speaking role and i 'm pretty sure that none appear in the background . its indicative of nothing , its just something that struck me . ) this is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles , but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch . around 7 out of 10 .
this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen . i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on tv i my eyes are glued to it . the acting and plot are amazing . it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics . i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama .
ok , i overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grumpy reviews . but i did enjoy it . i did n't laugh out loud , but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point . the story built . yeah , you knew it would have an happy ending -- this genre always does . meantime , it was quirky with sight gags you could miss , so pay attention when you watch . stiller and black delivered expertly yet again . good team . they should work together more . do n't know that it will be a cult classic , but it was certainly a fun ride . not as good as what about bob , or dirty rotten scoundrels but what is ? it is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie .
an opium den , a dirty little boy ( actually a midget ) , prostitutes galore , a violent fracas in a dive , a motel for sexual shenanigans , scantily clad babes with cleavage a lot , a boozer falling down the stairs , a racially mixed clientèle in a bar with asians , africans , and anglos treated equally , does this sound like a film playing at the local shopping mall ? wrong . these are all scenes from a 1933 musical . the first half of `` footlight parade '' is preparation for a musical extravaganza which occupies the last half of the film . chester kent ( cagney ) is about to lose his job and does lose his playgirl wife as a result of talking pictures squeezing out live stage musicals . his producers take him to see a popular talky of the day , john wayne in `` the big trail . '' before each showing of the flick , a dance number is presented as a prologue . shorts , news reels , serials , and cartoons would later serve the purpose . kent gets the idea that a prologue chain would be the road to salvation for the dwindling live musical business . kent is basically an idea man along the lines of choreographer busby berkeley . could it be that cagney 's character is patterned after berkeley ? could be . in preparation for the prologues , kent learns that his ideas are being stolen by a rival . he uncovers the traitor , fires him , then unbeknown to him a new leak is planted in the form a dazzling temptress . his assistant , nan prescott ( joan blondell - soon to be mrs. dick powell ) has the hots for kent and is determined to expose the wiles of the temptress . a new singer from arkansas college shows up in the form of scotty blain ( dick powell ) who turns out to be a real find and is paired with bea thorn ( ruby keeler ) . the resulting three prologue musicals , which could n't possibly have been presented on any cinema stage of the day , are as fresh and enjoyable today as they were over seventy years ago , `` honeymoon hotel , '' `` by a waterfall , '' and `` shanghai lil . '' of special note is the song and dance of tough-guy james cagney . like fred astaire and bill `` bojangles '' robinson , cagney 's dancing appeared natural and unrehearsed , although hours went into practice to get each step just right . not as good a singer as astaire , cagney 's singing , like astaire 's , sounded natural , unlike the crooning so popular at the time . it 's amazing that one person could be so talented and so versatile as james cagney . most critics prefer the `` shanghai lil '' segment over the other two . yet the kaleidoscopic choreography of `` by a waterfall '' is astonishing . how berkeley was able to film the underwater ballets and to create the human snake chain must have been difficult because it has never been repeated . the close up shots mixed brilliantly with distant angles is a must-see . the crisp black and white photography is much more artistic than it would have been if shot in color . though not nearly as socially conscious as `` gold diggers of 1933 , '' `` footlight parade '' stands on its own as one of the most amazing and outrageous musicals ever put on the big screen .
without being one of my favorites , this is good for being a change of pace ... even if only for a few minutes . it all starts with a big fight between tom , jerry and spike ( who is renamed `` butch '' here ) . they 're all beating each other , but suddenly spike makes a heroic and admirable decision : he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends . so , all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends ... which is n't going to last for long . meanwhile , the three become affectionate , patient and kind to each other . they even save each other when one of them is in danger of life . the relationship goes nothing but excellent , until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy . the three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalries . but still ... to see tom , jerry and spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience , even if only for a while . oh , by the way , as a curious fact , two songs from `` the wizard of oz '' are played here in instrumental versions : `` we 're off to see the wizard '' and `` somewhere over the rainbow '' .
trapped : buried alive brings us to a resort that has just opened , and is soon to close . we start with a guy in gear blowing up drifts , to avoid the possibility of avalanches . somehow , that does n't make sense . anyways , he 's about to blow away one particularly big one , when he notices the resort is open . despite his best efforts , higher authority tells him his day is over . soon , as everyone expects , an avalanche hits . look , i 'm not gon na reveal any more , all i can say is this was a b-movie designed for the family channel ( which i just saw it on , and the fact it had no commercials proves it 's a b-movie ) anyways , it 's a pretty decent film , but it 's partially unreal . firsthand , when people are buried by ice and snow , they 're buried . not just traced by powder . or , what about a cd for a screwdriver ? it 's not possible . and finally , what i ca n't stress enough , is that an explosion can not stop a avalanche , guaranteed . furthermore , it 's worth a rental or a tv viewing , but not owning . 7/10 . the movie is rated pg , but maybe it should have received something a little more strong . a boy nearly loses his foot in an elevator , but his leg is cut around the ankle , a guy is toasted by electricity and diesel , and in the weight room , dead people are laying around . enjoy .
i was reviewing some old vhs tapes i have and came across the tv show john denver & the muppets a christmas together.this made me go to my computer and look it up to see if i could find a dvd version of this show to buy . i was disappointed not to be able to find it yet on dvd . the show aired in 1979 and was a delightful show . i have the record and the cd but i would love to buy a dvd version of this show . the tape is old and picture quality is pretty good but fading , the sound is not as good as the cd . there is also a few other songs not put on the cd . as a fan of john denver and of the muppets , a dvd of this show would really be a good seller . if you do n't have the cd it is a wonderful chritmas collection of songs taken from that show . the album is also good if you can find it and still have a record player to play it on .
why a good actress like elizabeth berkley stars in this commonplace movie ? ? ? ! ! ! the cast gives some good performance ( elizabeth berkley as a barbie girl , ele keats as a girl without mother and justin whalin , a guy eternally lessened by his bother ) , but the direction is extremely boring and the story is not so interesting and original . i can not believe that a movie like this was produced for the big screen ! julie corman ( the producer ) : are you crazy ? ? ? ! ! !
i must confess to not having read the original m r james story although i have read many of his other supernatural tales . i 've also seen most of the previous bbc christmas ghost stories and this one , in my opinion , surpasses most of them , only equalling the signalman . i ca n't really fault a view from a hill - the direction and 'mood ' is perfect , as is the acting , lighting and , of course , the story and writing . i thoroughly enjoyed this and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team . i understand that the bbc plan to make some more ( not necessarily based on m r james stories ) so that 's promising . 10/10
it 's hard to put your finger on this one . basically i suppose it 's a comedy about an idle rich drunk who falls in love with a ( comparatively ) poor girl , whom he wants to marry at the risk of being disowned by his family . it has funny moments , romantic moments , and touching moments . dudley moore is funny and somehow makes his self-centred character endearing , liza minelli is a convincing foil as the the feisty opposite he attracts , but john gielgud steals the show as arthur 's wonderfully sarcastic butler . it 's corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack , and ran for nearly 3 months at our local fleapit .
very sweet pilot . the show reeks of tim burton 's better films ... edward sissorhands , big fish , charlie & the chocolate factory . the cinematography , the narration , the music , the external sets all scream tim burton . there has to be a connection , or a strong influence , i just have n't researched enough to know where it is . as i 've seen in the forums , yes anna friel is playing a poor man 's zooey deschanel . every time i see her on the screen i see zooey . do n't get me wrong , anna friel does a great job . her character is very sweet and lovable and you easily get attached to her . it 's more of a distraction that i keep thinking `` why did n't they get zooey deschanel '' . lee pace does a great job too . i kept trying to remember where i knew him from and just looked it up . wonderfalls ! ! ! great , short lived series from 2004 . if you enjoy pushing daisies you must go rent wonderfalls , which is another brian fuller creation .hmmmm loved seeing swoosie kurtz ( world according to garp ) and ellen greene ( little shop of horrors ) again . two underrated character actresses that never fail to bring it with their performances .
make no mistake , maureen o'sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever , and there will never be one more gorgeous . she is visually stunning . that aside , it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film . this is a great film . it not only has the classic tarzan aura , but also the feel of the continuing saga . we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory , one of them in love with jane , the other , a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history.and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic . there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted . however , the africans are depicted as individuals , and at the end , two even become more heroic than the white hunters , and stand out as such . in fact , the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters . the finale , also , is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie . the great lion attack has never been duplicated , and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction . if i left anything out , it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who have n't seen it . but it is everything you could want in a movie .
gédéon and jules naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie new york city firefighters . what they got was the only film footage inside the world trade center on september 11 . having worked with james hanlon 's ladder company before , jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak , while gédéon stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened . an airplane flying low over the city distracted jules , and he pointed the camera up , seconds before the plane crashed into tower one . jules asked the captain to follow him into the towers . the first thing he saw was two people on fire , something he refused to film . he stayed on site for the next several hours , filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there . the brothers naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent , grizzly , and gory . but the language from the firefighters is a little coarse , and cbs showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored . the brothers naudet mixed footage they filmed with one-on-one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis . unlike a feature film of similar title , most of the money from dvd sales go to 9/11-related charities . very well made , emotional , moving , and completely devoid of political propaganda , is the best documentary of the sort to date .
the john van druten broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern-day witch who beguiles a successful manhattan publisher . james stewart may get top billing , but it is kim novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen . the lead pairing is , in fact , one of the movie 's few weaknesses : the gray-haired stewart seems a bit old for the role , and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for novak , it 's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him , as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook . ( it is one of the story 's amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as greenwich village beatniks and bohemians . ) curiously , the stewart-novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in `` vertigo '' , released the same year as this film , but then `` vertigo '' had a compelling suspense story , and the benefit of alfred hitchcock 's direction . the film 's comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast , including a young jack lemmon ( as kim 's warlock brother ) , elsa lanchester ( their ditzy aunt ) , and ernie kovacs ( ! ) as a befuddled writer . hermione gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of grand witch . there 's lots to like in this movie -- wit , romance , and a great cast -- that is , if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting miss novak . i have seen the movie a half a dozen times , and i never can .
one of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in , it ends much to soon ! than were left looking at the screen like , `` no they did n't ! `` , lol . good performances all around ! the acting is marvelous with emily blunt simply outstanding ! i knew she would give a solid , convincing performance catching young victoria 's regality , temper , and vulnerability through out the entire movie . also , the production is outstanding in every way : style , substance and sensitivity . a remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in britian 's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as queen , later marrying prince albert , than ending with the birth of their first of nine children . it had a well written screenplay and flawless editing . rupert friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young prince albert vying to win the young queen 's attention , than securing her love , before lord melbourne ( paul bettany ) , was engrossing to watch . just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage victoria and her mother , which was fury at times , as with her mother and king william ( whom also disliked her mother ) . the acting and scenes were captivating , highly emotional . i would recommend this to anyone interested in the historical and political situation existing in that era , and indeed , anyone who loves a compelling true romance story
magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish , thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars . alan arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades . like any really fine film , it 's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming . i ca n't believe this film is so difficult to find -- i 'd buy it on dvd in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet .
director douglas sirk once said ` there 's a very short distance between high art and trash , and trash that contains craziness is by this very quality nearer to art ' . this statement defines his cinema perfectly , a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations , adventure and war films , westerns and of course , his famous melodramas . sirk 's melodramas were , as the very word signifies , dramas with music . the music sets the tone for his masterful style , and every stroke of his brush ( sirk was also a painter ) leaves a powerful image on the screen-turned-canvas . but this ai n't life but its representation , an imitation of life . sirk never tried to show reality , on the contrary . none of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by hollywood ( most notably technicolor ) to distinguish the artificial from the real thing . let 's remember that his golden period coincides with the time when hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama ( blackboard jungle , rebel without a cause ) . sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else . another of sirk 's statements summarizes this : ` you ca n't reach , or touch , the real . you just see reflections . if you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass ' . i defy anybody that has seen written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen . one ends up giving up . therefore , we are in a hall full of mirrors where there 's no difference between real and its false copy . nobody can say that the hadley are real people . that town ai n't real either , with those hideous oil pumps all over the place . so in this realm the acting is affected , the decore is fake , the trick is visible . everything is pushed a little bit off the limit ( the sexual connotations of dorothy malone with the oil tower , for example ) . sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time . ` the angles are the director 's thoughts ; the lighting is his philosophy ' . in written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows . the hadleys house , with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way . a house that resembles a mausoleum , that no party can cheer up . as tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night , sirk 's photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters , and so are the colours of the clothes they wear . drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director 's craft . sirk considered himself a ` story bender ' , because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose . written on the wind is a good example . it would n't work in any other hands . the other director that was using similar strategies was frank tashlin , who was for 50 's comedy the same that sirk was for melodrama . their films are full of the machinery of american life -advertising , tv sets , jukeboxes , washing machines , sport cars , vacuum cleaners- to depict its emptiness and decay . i 'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences . the game was played by both sides , so it was camp . now we regard them as ` cult ' or ` bizarre ' , because we are not those spectators anymore . that is why todd haynes 's homage ` far from heaven ' turns into a pastiche , because it reproduces sirk 's work nowadays as if nothing happened in between . then sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that julianne moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film . sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly . there were always immovable characters ( rock hudson and lauren bacall here ) against which he could assemble a series of split ones . his balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters , because these are the ones sirk is interested in too . when robert stack flies the plane and ` tempts ' lauren bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them ( obvious faustian echoes ) we are strangely fascinated with him too , as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with mitch alone by the river . in the sirk 's universe the studio often-imposed ` happy ends ' have no negative impact . in fact they worked just great . sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the deux ex machinea of his day . thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback , so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the hadley feud . it was pointed out the many similarities between written on the wind with the godfather saga . i absolutely agree and i 'm sure the parallel is not incidental . both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family . the temperamental son portrayed by robert stack has an amazing physical resemblance with jimmy caan 's sonny corleone . the action of fighting her sister 's male friend is symmetrical . the non-son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films , as the fact that both families carry the names of their town . even details as the gate that gives access to the property , and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves , suggest that coppola had written on the wind in mind while setting his masterwork . because both films deal with the subject of power : the acquisition of power , its manipulation and legacy ( even kyle hadley 's sterility , the event that hastens the turmoil , is an issue easily tied to the central theme of power , in this case , a weakness in sexual power ) . the other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is citizen kane . one would n't think at first of similarities between welles and sirk 's films but there are a good many , starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family 's fortune and ending in the fact that mitch wayne ( rock hudson ) , as charles foster kane , was adopted by a tutor , having his own father alive . amazingly , the same actor ( harry shannon ) perform both wayne and kane 's fathers . this detail is can not be a coincidence . written on the wind is a masterpiece in every aspect , in execution and vision , in style and technique , a highlight in the career of this wonderful director . some say that this is his best film . in my opinion , ` magnificent obsession ' , ` all that heaven allows ' , ` there 's always tomorrow ' and ` imitation of life ' are just as good . and for those who put sirk in the level of dallas or dinasty i wish them no happy end .
this movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made . i 've seen this movie for the first time a week ago , since then every day i see the opening and every time i feel as thrilled as i felt the first time i heard david niven uttering the immortal words from sir walter raleigh 's the pilgrimage : give me my scallop-shell of quiet , my staff of faith to walk upon , my scrip of joy , immortal diet , my bottle of salvation , my gown of glory , hope 's true gage ; and thus i 'll take my pilgrimage ( ) do you know why it would be a truism to say michael powell 's and emeric pressuburger 's lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening ? because they had been already admitted in the paradise of poets long before they made this movie . i imagine both of them facing trial during doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate god : i beg your pardon , sir . so , do you want to know what have we done during our lifetime ? well , well you 'll see : we 've written directed and produced : i know where i 'm going , colonel blimp , red shoes do you think that enough sir ? it is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with god , nature the muse or whatever you may call it when they shot a matter of life and death . the fact that other people 's lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody , notwithstanding i feel my life would have a meaning had i never done anything else that to see this movie . of course old-timers will be tempted to say : they do n't do movies like this one any more . they 'll be partially mistaken ; they did n't make movies like this in the past times either . i 've have already quoted keats here , but i 'll repeat his words : a thing of beauty is a joy forever .
the inspiring story of carl brashear ( cuba gooding , jr. ) , a black man who grew up in poverty in kentucky and then joined the us navy , aspiring to be the first black master diver in navy history . we are shown the series of struggles from boyhood on that brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true ( and then to keep it alive . ) not the least of the challenges was master diver bill sunday ( robert deniro ) , the head trainer at the diving school the navy sends brashear to , who is not especially sympathetic to brashear 's goals , but who ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and supporter . this is a good movie ; fast paced and with a lot of action , although not an `` action '' pic in the normal sense of the word . there 's a very human story here as well , and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it ; there 's also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960 's between older and younger naval officers ( the `` old navy '' vs the `` new navy . '' ) the performances are quite good - particularly goodings ' . i thought deniro was perhaps a bit over the top in his portrayal of sunday ( although , who knows , sunday might well have been this extreme kind of loose cannon ) and the portrayal of sunday 's wife gwen ( by charlize theron ) also made me question whether these parts were `` jazzed up '' to provide entertainment value . a good movie , though . i never once wondered if it was worth tuning into . 7/10
the dentist was made on the time when almost every profession had it 's psycho . we had mad police officers , ambulance men , secretery 's and that was just for starters . the dentist came suprisingly late because going to dentist is usually everyman 's nightmare . the plot is twisted . super clean dentist doctor feinstone lives perfect life in his great `` white house '' , he has beautiful blond wife and great place to work as a dentist . dark clouds are coming to his horizon in the form of nasty irs guy ( terminator 's earl boen ) , dirty pool cleaner `` cleaning '' his wife and suddenly everyone 's teeth seems to have gone through dark filter . he goes nutso and starts to take care of people teeth in the nasty way . and you do n't want to come to his path . crew were professional . producer/director brian yuzna had produced stylish horror movies like re-animator and from beyond . he directed the sequel to re-animator and his first movie society was nice spinoff from john carpenter 's they live . film 's producer pierre david is known from movies like scanners . cast was great . corbin bernsen really suprised me . i knew him from la law and major league , but i could newer dream him as a psycho dentist . he was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person . linda hoffman was beutiful and dumb as feinstones wife . micahel stadvec did not have much line 's , but after i saw him with ladies of the neighbourhood i knew my future profession . ken foree ( dawn of the dead , from beyond ) was nice sight as cop on the case . virginya keehne was the innocent teen who is about to be next client to feinstone . final warning : if you 're like me and have problem with dentist 's then maybe you should skip this one . but if you want to try than you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lots nasty drillings .
if you fast forward through the horrible singing , you will find a classic fairy tale underneath . christopher walken is very humorous and surprisingly good in the role . his trademark style of acting works well for the sly puss in boots . the other actors are well for their parts . i did not find any of the acting terribly fake or awkward . the king in particular appears a real dunce though , and i wonder if he is supposed to be . i can not remember the original tale . the special effects are typical of the eighties , but at least they are not overly fake like some of the computer generated fare that we see today . overall , i recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child at heart .
i 'm a pretty old dude , old enough to remember the taste of oreos and coke as they were 50-55 years ago , when every taste for a kid was fresh . i wish i have somehow set some aside then is some magical suspended locker , so that i could taste those things today . this magical locker might even have adjusted the fabric of the food to account for how i 've drifted , physically and otherwise , a sort of dynamic chemistry of expectations . over the half century , they would have had to adjust quite a bit , because you see i would have known that i set them aside . eating one now would be a celebration of self and past , and story , and sense that would almost make the intervening years an anticipated reward . i did n't have enough sense to do that with original coke . and i could n't have invented one of those magical psychic lockers  not then . but i did something almost as good . in the seventies , i really tuned into roman polanski . he was a strange and exotic pleasure  you know , movies smuggled out of the soviet block . movies so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks afterward . movies that make you want to live with polish women , one , and then deciding that they would be the last to get it . here 's what i did . i took what i knew would be my favorite polanski movie and set it aside . i did not watch it . i deferred until i thought i would be big enough to deserve it . over the years , i would test myself , my ability to surround beauty and delineate it without occupying it . there probably are few poles who have worked at this , practicing to deserve chopin . working to deserve womanness when i see it . trying to get the inners from the edges . recently , i achieved something like assurance that it was time to pull this out . i already knew that i was already past the time when this would work optimally , because i had already seen and understood `` 9th gate . '' if you do not know this , it is about a man who innocently rents a room in which the previous tenant ( about whom the story is named ) jumped out the window , to die later after this man ( played by polanski ) visits . what happens is that time folds and he becomes this woman . we are fooled into believing that he is merely mad . but the way we follow him , he is not . he merely has flashes that the world is normal , and that the surrounding people are not part of a coven warping his reality . the story hardly matters . what matters is how polanksi shapes this thing , both in the way he inhabits the eye that only makes edges and in inhabiting the body that only consists of confused flesh . the two never meet . there is a dissonance that may haunt me for the next 30 years . its the idea about and inside and an outside with no edges at all  at all except a redhead wig . i know of no one else that could do this , this sketch that remains a sketch , this horror that remains natural . to understand the genius of this , you have to know one of the greatest films ever made ; `` rear window . '' the genius of that film is the post-noir notion that the camera shapes the world ; that the viewer creates the story . what roman does is take this movie and turn it inside out . in rear window , the idea was that the on-screen viewer ( jimmy stewart ) was the anchor and everything else was fiction , woven as we watched . here , the on screen apartment dweller is the filmmaker . we know this . we know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator . we know it is true that bodies shift identity , that times shift , that causality is plastic . we know that the narrator will kill us . we know that the narrator will leave us in a perpetual horror , on that edge that he imputes but never shows us and lets us imagine . ted 's evaluation -- 4 of 3 : every cineliterate person should experience this .
this film has been on my wish list for ten years and i only recently found it on dvd when my partner 's grandson was given it . he watched it at and was thrilled to learn that it was about my generation - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it - and me . luckily i borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and i cried all through it . not only did it capture the emotions , the class distinction , the hardship and the warmth of human relationships of those years ( as well as the cruelties ( spoken and unspoken ) ; but it was accurate ! i am also a bit of an anorak when it comes to arp uniforms , ambulances ( lcc ) in the right colour ( white ) and all the impedimenta of the management of bomb sites and the work of the heavy rescue brigades . i could n't fault any of this from my memories , and the sandbagged anderson shelter and the wvs canteens brought it all back . the difference between the relatively unspoiled life in the village and war-torn london was also sharply presented i re-lived 1939/40 and my own evacuation from london with this production ! i know jack gold 's work , of course , and one would expect no more from him than this meticulous detail ; but it went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep chords about human responses and the only half-uttered value judgements of those years . it was certainly one of the great high spots in john thaw 's acting career and of gold 's direction and deserves to be better known . it is a magnificent film and i have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends .
i just watched holly along with another movie about trafficking and child sexual exploitation called trade at film by the sea international film festival . i have to say that holly blew trade out of the water . holly is a powerful and amazing film on many different levels . from purely an artistic and cinematic perspective , it is amazing . the sound-mixing , camera angles , directing and acting are all spot on . additionally , the way it handles the subject matter is tasteful and non-exploitative . it presents the issue of child sexual exploitation in a way that is both educational and accurate . the filmmakers paid an exquisite amount of attention to detail , truly capturing the nuances of the epidemic of child sexual exploitation and trafficking . too often when dealing with a subject matter of this kind , it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape , and violence . holly is able to achieve all of this without falling into that typical hollywood trend . i 've had the pleasure of seeing holly at two separate film festivals , once in the us and once in netherlands . i can honestly say that i have never seen audiences more moved . just listening to conversations after the screening , people are asking what they personally can do to fight child sexual exploitation . i highly recommend it to everyone , both for its cinematic value and its subject matter .
an excellent and accurate film ... mcgovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off . he is not afraid to tell the truth , even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy . once again , mcgovern brings in christopher eccleston , though not in as high a profile a role as he played in hillsborough . i found this movie as accurate , well acted and well presented as hillsborough and i applaud mcgovern for his poignant unapologetic writing . well done and my hat is off to the writer , the actors , the production crew . a great film !
i do n't know what the previous reviewer was watching but i guess that 's what reviews are , personal taste . missed in this movie was the depth , a very deep film , many layers of emotion , affecting . undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs , taboos of the times and classes , race relations not being in a very good state of equality , guilt , yearning , hate , confusion , very dark emotionally i thought , under the skin , you have to submit to the aire of it , a flowing movie , not slow as stated before , release yourself to the flow of the film , the emotions will show themselves , characters reveal their flaws , their nasty insides , excellent and actually very cruel !
red skelton was still another major star who made the transition from movies to television with ease . his shows certainly brought a laughter to the american households of years back . he would begin the show with an opening monologue . afterwards , we would have a variety of characters . remember gertrude and heathcliff in the monologue ? how can we ever forget san fernando red ? i remember one episode where as a king red introduced his queen by referring to her as your fatness . go know that red would use his comedic talents to really hide from his tragic life . he lost a son to leukemia at age 11 or so . his wife , georgia , died by suicide .
i reflect back to the days when i held my boyfriends hat to smell him into existence in my time alone when i was 16 . the little moments of this film are so accurate and right on pace with what is going on in the minds and hearts of young girls during those coming of age teenage years . now at my age i want to preach to them about their decisions and how life during those times are not as important as it all seems in those moments . that if they can be patient in their youth and wait to experience the hardships of life both external and internal that life would be so much sweeter . but then again young people today are faced with some variables that i never had to deal with a youth . the three main characters well played by all three actors ( kerry wahington - lanisha , anna simpson - joycelyn and melissa martinez- maria ) give us the very believable depiction of a piece of reality for young girls living in impoverished situations . they have impoverished family lives all being raised by single mothers with expectation of lanisha whose father is present but not actively supporting her day to day . the have impoverished educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models . these situations powerfully affect them and is their reality but all this is of no great depressive concern to these young women in their day to day . they except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with . finding true love in a male , having good friends that you can depend on , gaining some respect/love and responsibility from parents and enjoying life . this is were this film cross the race , age and gender gap imposed upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is stamped . the director and writer mckay explains on the dvd how each of scenes got into his head , by just observing young people of that age that lived in those types of neighborhoods . plus you add three up and coming actresses who are not so far removed from that time in their own lives that you get a real good synergy of reality and acting at its best . the one thing i know about ( african americans and hispanics ) is that there is always a spiritual family member or neighbor that is in the foreground or near ground believing in a better day and better life and future in spite of the present situation and is role modeling that to some extent . this was never touched in the movie in order not to preach and i understand that but it also narrows the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves . the hope factor : i now think about my future and where i have come from and say as lanisha did ` today is a good day . ' yes poverty still exists , racism , sexism , and any other ism that we can added . yes some of each of these young girls actions perpetuate the isms and are self-destructive , everything around them is impoverished but none of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future . i was left with saddened hope of each of the characters and a deeper desire to be a role model in the life of some young girl on the edge of making a destructive decision . i suppose that is the value of film it should not only entertain but cause each of us to think , reflect and then act in some positive way to make this world a better place .
this film resembles in many ways ` enemy of the state ' with will smith and gene hackman , as we have an innocent ( black ) man being pursued by the ` government ' with all the modern technology known to man . usually when storyline is copied like this the result is a disaster . that does not apply here . of course i love everything david morse does , so maybe my comments are not fair , but there were more good things about this film then that . the main baddy , played by doug hutchison , was brilliant , and the story flowed with excellent extras such as david paymer and robert pastorelli . our hero , alvin sanders ( played by jamie foxx ) , was however irritating most of the part . he is so out of place , cracking bad jokes , evoking no sympathy from the audience . or not to begin with , the strange thing is that he kinda grows on you ( and on his followers as well ! ) . i did n't expect much when i rented it , but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy bits . 7/10
fragile carne , just before his great period . although it is sometimes hesitantly directed , and marred by longueurs , hotel du nord is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of french films of the late 1930s , as well as a relative lightness of touch unusual with this director . all of his great virtues are here : the cramped interiors broken up by gliding , complex , delicious camera movements ; a melancholy deployment of light and shade ; remarkable , wistful sets by alexander trauner , which are so evocative that they , as the title suggests , take on a shaping personality of their own ; the quietly mournful music of maurice jaubert ; a seemingly casual plot about romance , tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters ; extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time , in this case louis jouvet and arletty . in fact , the film 's biggest failing , and i find myself astonished ( as someone who usually , didactically , minimises its importance ) to admit it , is its script . it has plenty of wit and poignancy , but without the poetry and irony regular carne collaborator jacques prevert brought to their best films , it can not avoid slipping into cliche ( even if it is only cliche in hindsight ) . ostensibly set in the boarding house , the film sets up its opening idea of community with two interconnecting tales of doomed love , and emotional , metaphysical and actual isolation the doomed love scenario is the one that works least well . annabella is very beautiful , but not very good at doing tragic , while aumont 's callowness , brilliantly appropriate though it may be , by its nature obtrudes any real , felt , romance . maybe it 's just me , but i find it hard to sympathise with a couple , so young , so attractive , who , after only a few months , are so racked with despair that they have to shoot each other . their high-flown lines are rather embarrassing too . of course , this affair is not meant to be plausible - they are symbolic of youth , hope and possibility being crushed in france , or maybe france itself , despairing , resigned , waiting for death . for symbols to be truly powerful , they must convince on a narrative level , which , i feel , they do n't quite here . what saves this plot is its connection with the story of m. edmond , a character linked to the great tradition of french gangsters . although we only learn it gradually , he is a killer in hiding , living off the prostitute played by arletty , having dobbed in his accomplices . in his previous 'role ' - and the theatricality of his position is crucial - he had one set of traits ; in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite . living a rather aimless life , he is profoundly shaken by the lovers ' pact , and becomes fatalistic , realising the folly of trying to cheat death . in this way - the admission that one is less a person than a collection of signs , and that death is an unavoidable reality the most powerful masculinity must succumb to - edmond is like a romantic prototype of melville 's clinical killers . with one exception - he gives briefly into hope , a delusion which only strenghtens - if that 's not too much of an unbearable irony - his fatal resolve . all this could have been trite if it was n't for the truly amazing performance of louis jouvet . i had studied his theatrical work at college , but this was my first taste of his screen talents , and he reveals himself to be worthy of the greats - grant , mastroianni , clift , mason , mitchum , cotten - giving a quiet nobility to a role which is more of a conception ( he , needless to say , is allegorical too ) than an actual person . edmond begins the film a minor supporting character , but emerges as a tragic hero of some force . like all those major actors , jouvet 's brilliance lies in what he conceals . on a formal level , what amazes is carne 's grasping , ten years before its flourishing , of the techniques of the great hollywood melodramas of sirk , ophuls , ray and minnelli . although his theatricality lacks the fluidity and clear-eyed beauty of sierck 's contemporary german melodramas ( check out the masterpieces zu neuen ufern and la habenera ) , carne 's style truly fits his theme - that of entrapment , paralysis , resignation . the film 's principle motif is that of water - the credits float and dissolve , the hotel stands by a waterway - but instead of renoir 's open river of possibility , we have a canal , stagnant and manmade , going nowhere . the film begins as it ends , and the setting never changes , except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return . characters can only escape through death - their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy , the walls and frames that hold them captive , the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve . any hope at the end , therefore , is profoundly , if romantically , compromised .
`` bend it like beckham '' is a film that got very little exposure here in the united states . it was probably due to the fact that the movie was strongly british in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with football , ( soccer here ) , which some may have trouble relating too in the u.s . it 's unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and deserved much more coverage over here . i think the basis of the storyline , ( following a dream ) , is something many people can relate to and in the end , `` bend it like beckham '' proves to be a good-feeling film with a source of inspiration and really good acting . i was not overly excited about seeing this film initially but now i regret not seeing it sooner . i highly recommend this movie !
11 oscar nominations and zero win ! ! ! am yet to understand why - its not like the actors in the movie did any better thereafter that you can make it by giving them awards for trivial roles like it was done with halle berry and denzel washington - whoopi , oprah , margaret avery , danny glover etc- were all amazing - i am curious to get scripts of the discussions at the oscars that year ...... it should go into the shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges .... its an amazing book - but true to alice walker 's style of writing she has a way of seeming like she is exaggerating her characters - so i am so glad that they screen adaptation took a few things out . the cinematography was amazing - the african scenes live much to be desired - the african part in the book is supposed to be set in liberia - somewhere in west africa - but oh no ! steven spielberg thinks the world is so dumb that they cant think of africa outside of the safaris - so yes there had to be a complimentary zebra and wildlife scene when we all know there are none west africa -- -- and most of all why get the people to speak swahili -- - who in west africa speaks swahili ? ? i just had to get that out of the way ....... but as a story - amazing , film-making - out of this world - classic yes ! ! i own it and i watch it when my soul needs some rejuvenation .
yes , shakespeare would indeed have been proud . laurence fishburne was not at his best but certainly not bad . kenneth brannagh on the other hand was brilliant . his scheming was wonderful as was his toying with the audience . very nice work . there were at times too little drama where more would have been expected . cassio 's slaying , for instance , was a bit clouded by too much happening to far apart , causing the spectator to twist his head to grasp it all . did i mention michael maloney ? his madness striken roderigo was unusual ; annoying even . if you have n't seen othello before , see this . if you have n't read othello , see this . if you have n't heard othello , see this . you do , on the other hand , do yourself a favour by reading it , seeing it acted onstage and hearing it sung too .
sarah silverman is a dangerous bitch ! she 's beautiful , sexy , funny and talent , dark and demonic . i read the other 'comment ' on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just do n't get it . nothing that appears on t.v . is an accident . too much money , time and work is put into the production of a t.v . show for there to be mistakes . this show is stupid because sarah wanted it to be stupid . this show is juvenile because sarah wanted it to be juvenile . i thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre . it 's a lot like pee-wee 's playhouse for maladjusted , slacker twenty-something glue sniffing , future pornstars of america from the valley . the cast is awesome . the scenarios and action is well-paced . i hope this show succeeds since comedy central did n't let david spade keep his show . who plays sarah 's sister ? she not in the cast listing on the show 's home page . i would love to see her stand-up . does anyone know about her up-coming show dates or dvds that may be floating around out there ?
loopy , but shrewd and formidable mob boss vic ( an excellent performance by richard dreyfuss ) gets released from a mental hospital . several of vic 's fellow criminal cohorts who include volatile henchman `` brass balls '' ben london ( a gloriously manic and over-the-top hammy portrayal by gabriel byrne ) , the smarmy jake parker ( a perfectly smug kyle maclachlan ) , and vicious rival `` wacky '' jacky jackson ( a neat turn by burt reynolds ) all try to bump vic off . meanwhile , laid-back and self-assured hit-man mickey holliday ( nicely played with low-key confidence by jeff goldblum ) finds himself caught in the middle of all this deadly lunacy . writer/director larry bishop brings a supremely hip , quirky , and original idiosyncratic sensibility to this deliciously dark and deadpan pitch-black comedy about betrayal , loyalty , and ruthless ambition run dangerously amok . the bang-up cast have a field day with the colorfully grotesque rogues ' gallery of blithely amoral and treacherous hoodlums : ellen barkin as tough , sultry moll rita everly , henry silva as vic 's reliable right-hand man sleepy joe carisle , gregory hines as philosophical smoothie jules flamingo , diane lane as vic 's sweet , perky mistress grace , billy drago as the slimy wells , and christopher jones as brutish rub-out artist nicholas falco . bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic ace assassin nick . popping up in nifty bits are billy idol as a blustery thug , michael j. pollard as the ill-fated red , joey bishop as mortician mr. gottlieb , rob reiner as a jolly chauffeur , and richard pryor as jimmy the gravedigger . byrne 's delightfully insane duet with singer paul anka on `` my way '' rates as a definite sidesplitting highlight . a tense and amusing climactic mexican stand-off likewise tickles the funny bone something hysterical . frank byers ' slick cinematography , the outrageously nutty dialogue , earl rose 's jazzy cocktail lounge score , and a choice soundtrack of vintage swinging golden oldies all further enhance the engagingly peculiar charm of this immensely entertaining one-of-a-kind curio .
john water 's ( `` pink flamingos '' ... ) `` pecker '' is the best movie i 've seen in a while . it gives the viewer a surreal image of life in baltimore ( i live in nearby washington , dc ) , with a warhol-like use of color , exaggerated motions and emotions . pecker becomes larger than his town can handle , and he is separated from his loved-ones ( including a sexy ricci ) by his man-loving art manager . the picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth -- kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day -- and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic , it only made the whole thing more profound and critical . it is a celebration of life , liberty , and the right to bear arms ... and everything else this country stands for . -juan pieczanski ( jpieczanski @ sidwell.edu )
this film is a complete re-imagining of romeo and juliet in tel aviv and nablus . the lovers are one from tel aviv et the other from nablus . there is a border between them , and a constant state of war with the israeli army ever present everywhere and the palestinian militants everywhere else with their bombs . the situation is bleak enough . we can imagine love in that enormous loveless trap . but the film goes several light years further by imagining the two lovers are gay , noam from tel aviv and ashraf from nablus . to be gay is accepted in tel aviv . it is off limits in nablus . the conflict between the two peoples , the two communities is thus doubled with a conflict between two cultures , two ethics . but this could even be livable if the war did not bring some extra dimension . ashraf 's sister is going to get married to a militant activist in nablus . ashraf finally tells his sister about his being gay . she can not accept it but accepts to speak about it later . from the wedding itself the newly married husband sends a commando into tel aviv to set up a bomb attack . it takes place in a café in tel aviv and one friend of noam 's is severely wounded . bad enough . the isareli army sends a commando to nablus to arrest the person responsible for this attack , but it turns sour and the newly married wife is shot dead in the street . the funeral follows the wedding . the husband and widower volunteers for a suicide bomb attack . ashraf volunteers to take his place . the exiled lover comes back to tel aviv to die and kill a few people to avenge his sister . he arrives at a diner managed by some friends of noam 's . but noam sees him and gets out to speak to him . ashraf has moved back to the middle of the street and he detonates his bomb when noam reaches him in the street . the vengeance reunites the two lovers in death . we thus have the dual conflict but we do not have the prince of verona , a neutral character that can impose peace , or even worse the prince seems to have chosen sides and to be on the side of israel . the game is entirely false and death is sure on both sides . but the dimension of impossible love is all the stronger because it is redoubled by a play in the film , a play that shows love in auschwitz , between two prisoners , one wearing a yellow star and the other a pink triangle . this is both strikingly strong and breathtakingly shocking : gay love in auschwitz . what comes out of the film is that over there in tel aviv or nablus love is impossible . the film is thus a denunciation of the conflict in palestine that can not but continue though it has no reason to even exist though it has thousands of reasons to go on . we should never have let great britain deal with the region a long time ago . today we have to find a solution in which no one will be humiliated . this will only be able to succeed if everyone comes together in order to find a lasting solution . but so far everyone is trying to avoid that general confrontation and discussion preferring bilateral manipulations . so suffering will go on and love will be forbidden , of course not sex since children are needed for the war to go on : so let 's procreate more and more little soldiers . but love is just an extra-terrestrial concept . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine & university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne
i liked this film very much . the story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow . there is no resolution to the story whatsoever , and you are left to wonder what really happened . since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this . i especially like the `` dating '' scenes between the boys and i was drawn into their lives . and of course any film with a naked staphane rideau will get a couple of extra points . ; - )
i saw this film at the toronto film festival , where it received a standing ovation ! this film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before -- namely about the rosenstrasse ( a street in berlin ) uprising of german gentile women who were married to jews at the end of the second world war . as such , it is a unique story , and what 's more , is the only film about the holocaust that i have ever seen that shows that there were good germans ( the helping family in `` anne frank '' for instance was dutch ) who did not support the nazis , and , in fact , had the fortitude to stand up against their own country 's immorality and brutality during the nazi regime , at the risk of their very lives . the acting is great across the board , the framing story in new york interesting and intricate , the direction from von trotta masterful in every scene , and the production values , including the gorgeous cinematography , outstanding . of course the family in new york could be speaking german . many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family -- a common occurrence . so that criticism is unwarranted . to say more would spoil the experience . the film is long , but i did not look at my watch once . i am hoping this film gets some distribution is north america , for not only is this film a masterpiece , but it can actually help heal any animosity people have towards the germans because of their support of hitler . if this film is playing in your area , i urge you to see it ! you will be glad you did !
basically , i like verhoeven film because in his film , i enjoy a brilliant pscychosexual story that i have seen before in `` basic instinct '' .it is really a wonderful thriller i enjoyed very much.so it is obviously for me to watch this another verhoeven movie . well , it is his previous direction before his block buster hit `` basic instinct '' and for that i was very much curious to watch that movie and yeah , the movie has fulfilled my hope and expectation . this movie `` the fourth man '' is a brilliant pscychosexual drama which is a lit bit complex for some audiences . the story of this movie is about a gay writer named `` reve '' ( krabbe ) , an alcoholic person who is lives by his own moral values and sees many visions that may warn him from a future accident.after the end of his lecture , he introduce a seductive woman named `` christine '' , who has a mysterious past she does n't want to reveal.reve do sex with her at her house as she is a boy.next morning , he watch her sexy , macho boyfriend 's picture on her table , the person he met at the station.he is curious to meet him and tell christine to invite him to her house . that 's it . i do n't want to reveal the entire story because it is a verhoeven movie and the end of the film is really surprising ! especially , i like the character `` reve '' which is brilliantly played by `` krabbe '' .i basically like his acting because as a gay person i am purely identified with his character and yeah i like his charming face . i would like thanks mr.verhoeven to make such a black comedy . i rate this movie : 10 out of 10 .
there 's so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin . en la mente del asesino ( inside the killer 's mind ) , that it 's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning . let 's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really , really great done . it´s made with super 8 , black and white shots , 35 milimeters , color , interviews , flashbacks . aro tolbukhin it´s like a movie made a documental or viceversa , which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering , did he really ever existed ? the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala , worked in a religious mission and then killed some people . an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced . the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death . nowadays , some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character . the one we are witness of -the movie . for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aro´s mind , mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done . nevertheless , the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view ; they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions , we clearly never justify them . so , the first half is based upon recollecting information ; later things turn into aro 's childhood , giving the movie such an incredible new force ( even tough never got weak or boring ) . i do n't mean -and do n't want- to spoil anything ; so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you , believe me , the trip to see it is more than worthy .
a lot of people unfairly sh ! t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining . devil 's experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work -- not just the infamous eyeball scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a sledgehammer are very realistic -- especially for the video 's vintage and low-budget . let me start at the beginning now for those who do n't know : this film is an `` extreme '' torture/fake snuff film that surfaced in japan in the mid-80s . it 's plot as it stands is simple : a young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breaking point is . this entails brutal violence -- all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking application of hot oil to the captive girl 's arm and placing of maggots in the subsequent flaky wound . the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns slapping the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground . these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings . the actress who plays the victim of the `` experiment '' is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera . her reactions as she has headphones strapped to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling . some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest . also there is a disturbing scene where the giggling captors through guts at her and one other disgustingly sleazy scene where she is spun in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she pukes . if you have n't seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot . 8.5/10 for devil 's experiment .
`` the groove tube '' was initially shown on video , in the first `` video theaters '' here in boston . in one room , there were tv monitors on high stands , with old movie theater seats , in small groups facing the monitors . there were old refrigerators stocked with pepsi , and baskets of york peppermint patties . in a second , smaller room , there were no seats , just large pillows . that was the 'smoking ' room , i.e. , people got high in there . that act only added to the hilarity of the video . i was a 'frequent viewer ' ; the scenes i liked most and remember to this day are : koko the clown , the kramp family kitchen ( kramp easy-lube shortening ) , safety sam/ vd psa , the chevy chase hitchhiker w/ nude runs through the woods , the finger ballet on what was eventually revealed to be the nude body of a woman . the last item was very reminiscent of the late , incredible ernie kovacs . now , i 've lost a lot of readers that are under 48 ( `` who is ernie kovacs ? ? '' ) but trust me , it 's funny stuff . one reason i was a 'frequent viewer ' was that i , and my friends , would bring other `` groove tube '' virgins to see it . we would sit and slyly watch the faces of the 'virgins ' as the `` safety sam '' psa would play . as the camera slowly zooms in on `` sam '' , we would wait for that `` oh ! '' of recognition on the 'virgin 's ' face . each time was more hilarious than the last . and then that 'virgin ' would then bring a friend to see the show , repeating what we had done . to get this joke , you must watch the video . yes , some of it is dated , but most plays , film , television , and now videos are . just look at any video made in the 1980 's . i did see `` the groove tube '' in a theater as a film , a grainy transfer from the original video . it had been cut , and was missing some of the original high-point scenes . the first `` saturday night live '' show , featuring chevy chase , elicited instant remarks of , `` that 's the guy from `` the groove tube '' `` , so it was a precursor for chevy . i ca n't look at a can of shortening without hearing the voice-over , `` coat your hands with a generous amount of kramp easy-lube shortening ... '' and thinking of the `` kramp holiday loaf '' recipe . always gets me laughing in the baking needs aisle in the grocery store . the early 70 's were parlous times ; `` the groove tube '' was fresh , new , and really 'got ' the humor of the times . it offered a 'hip generation ' , humor that was n't available in any other format/medium . mjh
this show has a great storyline ! it 's very believable ! a mans wife dies and he cant take care of his children alone so he calls on his brother in law his best friend and many others come later on in the show . such as rebeecca donaldson , , the lovable yet strong dog comet , nikki and alex who you can find out for yourself ( i do n't want to spoil it for you ) and of coerce kimmy gibler ! ( the sidekick of dj ) but the kids are wonderful too . this is mary kate and ashley first took off ! and also you may know candace cameron bure from shows like st.elsewere punky brewster and that 's so raven ! jodie sweetin plays steph the love able middle child who feels left out . really this is a very good show !
legendary movie producer walt disney brought three of the world 's greatest fairy tales to the screen . they remain among the most popular animated films of all time . the first was his groundbreaking classic `` snow white and the seven dwarfs '' released in 1937 . the last was the then-under appreciated `` sleeping beauty '' which made it 's debut in 1959 . in between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale : `` cinderella '' ( 1950 ) . of the three films , `` cinderella '' is the one most faithful to its origins . ironically , unlike `` snow white '' , which for better or worse , became for many the definitive version of the story . `` cinderella '' did not follow the same path . although it was a hit and , like `` snow white '' , was responsible for restoring the dwindling disney fortunes , it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved . disney , for once , did himself proud , electing not to tamper with a classic , instead elaborating and adding substance to the tale , rather than rewriting it for the screen . the result was enchanting . a combination of superb animation ( in beautifully soft technicolor ) and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a radiance that endures to this day . ilene woods , who was a radio performer , recorded demonstration discs of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material , al hoffman , mack david , and jerry livingston . when disney heard them , he knew he had found his cinderella . and indeed he had . woods heartfelt renditions of `` a dream is a wish your heart makes '' , `` so this is love '' and `` oh sing sweet nightingale '' are perfect . eleanor audley , who would go on to voice maleficent in `` sleeping beauty '' , masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother , while rhoda williams and lucille bliss were convincingly nasty stepsisters . luis van rooten admirably performed as both the king and the grand duke , and james macdonald was endearing as both jaq and gus , cinderella 's devoted mice . william phipps has little dialog as the prince ( future talk show host mike douglas provided his singing voice ) but film ( and disney ) veteran , verna felton was born to play the fairy godmother , and she made the best number , ( the oscar-nominated `` bibbidi-bobbidi-boo '' ) her own show-stopper . among the artists responsible for the `` look '' of the film , was mary blair , whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by disney . her elegant french-period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie . but , most important of all ' are the believable characters -- from cinderella , right down to lucifer , the stepmother 's deliciously evil cat . they bring both life and vibrancy to the often told story , something very difficult to create in an animated film . in conjunction with the film 's 55-year anniversary , ( and , not so coincidentally , the coming holiday season ) `` cinderella '' has just been released on a special edition dvd . it simply has never looked better . the fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated -- suffice it to say , it looks wonderful . an enhanced stereo soundtrack has been added , and serves the music well . the dvd extras , now a standard part of disney platinum editions , are too numerous to list here , but as usual , some are directed towards children , some are slanted to adults , and the rest fall somewhere in between . but real fans will want to get the deluxe gift set , because , along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches , it includes a 160-page hardback book , which not only incorporates most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release , but much more as well . as usual for disney , `` cinderella '' will only be available for a limited time . so , if like me , you are a `` cinderella '' lover , get it now ! this edition is truly a `` dream come true . ''
not knowing what this film was about , i checked it out at the video store and after seeing it , i enjoyed it . little seen multi-genre flick from director bernard rose ( candyman , immortal beloved ) . great story and characters . as a fan of glenne healdy 's , i was surprised of her british accent . the only exception for this film was the ending . however , it is worth the rent .
when i saw the exterminators of year 3000 at first time , i had no expectations for that movie . although , it was n't so bad as i was thought . it 's kind of italian version of roadwarrior , with cast , that is almost famous in italy , including venantino venantini . behind the story is elisa briganti and dardano sacchetti , who are also responsible for story of zombie flesh-eaters . you can also see other links to italian horror movies : luca venantini plays the role of tommy , and you can see that kid in paura nella citta dei morti viventi ( city of the living dead aka gates of hell ) as john robbins and in cannibal apocalypse as the role of mary 's brother . quite entertaining movie , with some dull parts .
without `` mental anachronism '' , this film which i would like to find in dvd offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the `` disenchantment of the world '' . that , there is thirty years , a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding . it would be necessary to be able to see and re-examine it film for better seizing than the temporal and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included/understood , analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of `` primitive thought '' . because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the secularized world however contain certain keys of our behavior , that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance . if somebody knows where i then to get a numerical copy or vhs to me or dvd thank you in advance .
this movie is just great . it 's entertaining from beginning to the end , you 're always gon na be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie . in my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics . sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain-rescue guy gabe walker . together with him michael rooker makes a great appearance as hal tucker . and then , john lithgow , one of the best performances i 've seen of him as a villain . and the fact that 75 % of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action ! brilliant movie !
i 've seen the original english version on video . disney 's choice of voice actors looks very promising . i ca n't believe i 'm saying that . the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own . the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film . the animation quality is excellent ! if you 've seen disney 's job of kiki 's delivery service you can see the quality in their production . it almost redeems them for stealing the story of kimba the white lion . ( but not quite ! ) finally miyazaki 's films are being released properly ! i ca n't wait to see an uncut english version of nausicaa !
hello , i was alanrickmaniac . i 'm a still crazy-holic . it was just another movie i watched partly on tv . then i had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends . then i wanted the dvd , because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks . after the dvd i had to lay my hands on the soundtrack . then on several film posters and the film script . right now it has become that worse that i try to push other people into addiction with my website and still crazy parties . how could that happen ? what drove me into addiction ? ok , it 's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the british can produce . alright , the movie is worlds apart from stuff like `` this is spinal tap '' , because of the characters , that are n't childish or ultra cool , but real . this is a story about men getting older , too . a story about men getting along with each other . or do n't . it contains some of the best actors possible . tim spall . stephen rea . bruce robinson . jimmy nail . and bill nighy . bill nighy who puts on one of the best performances i 've ever seen in a film . good , the soundtrack is unbelievable . foreigner 's mick jones has written the songs for the imaginary band strange fruit . jimmy nail who plays bass-man les wickes and bill nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer ray simms are really singing . we know that about jimmy nail , but if you 've only heard bill nighy 's singing in `` love actually '' , you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is . well , you 'll fever for every scene to come for the x-th time , especially those concert scenes . you 'd die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when strange fruit is doing `` all over the world '' , singing on the top of your lungs . you long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real strange fruit at wisbech 's festival stage . it 's hard but ... i 'm addicted to this film . i 'm addicted to strange fruit . if there 's a world where this band really exists i 'd like to move there . got still crazy ... anyone ?
in some ways , the wrath of kriemhild surpasses siegfried 's death , but it also loses some of that film 's greatness . the plot of this one is more cohesive than the first , which is quite amazing . the second half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through , until , that is , you get to the climactic battle scenes ; only the iliad 's are better . lang and harbou embellished the huns . the poet-compiler of the nibelungenlied did n't know a hun from his right ball , and as a result they are , more or less , the same as the burgundians in custom . for example , although the poet clearly describes etzel as a heathen ( which is kriemhild 's main concern as rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him ) , when she gets to hunland , the first thing she does is go to mass . the huns here are clearly heathens ; they 're almost like caveman . the depiction of them is hilarious , especially verbal , the jester , who has two marvelous scenes . etzel 's character has been given more weight . he is much more formidable . all he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem . lang and harbou are masterful at building suspense , especially at the banquet scene , which is intercut with verbal 's second performance to an amazing effect . however , as is the nature of this half of the poem , the film 's amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one , for the most part , except for a dazzling sequence where etzel 's hall burns down with the nibelungs inside . the one thing i do have to object to is the way harbou changes the ending . spoilers : in the poem , after hildebrand captures hagen and gunther , they are imprisoned . kriemhild visits hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde . he refuses and she herself decapitates her brother . when hagen still refuses , she decapitates him . hildebrand ( or possibly dietrich ) is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he , in turn , decapitates her , calling her a `` devil woman '' . etzel , who is much weaker in the poem than he is here , says something silly like : `` ah me ! '' i can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as hildebrand brings them from the castle ; to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic . i also understand why they did n't have hildebrand kill kriemhild : his character is much reduced here ; his name is only mentioned once . but , to have kriemhild kill herself , adopting brynhild 's death from the icelandic sources , is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them . the point of the poem is that kriemhild 's wrath goes far beyond it should into the realm of pure evil . here , we simply have her die for her lost love . it 's not as interesting .
takashi miike 's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements . this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark . even as a kid , i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales ; horrible things happen to people in most children 's books . miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier ( and more disturbing ) than what they appear to be at first glance . the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom . he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions . westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids . i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers . he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain . but a self-possessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers . i thought it was a great film . highly recommended .
cusack does his best david niven in this one , although i do n't know if anyone besides me noticed it . when seen with this in mind , its a deliciously over saturated 'wants to be taken more seriously than austin powers but still be pretty d * mn funny ' reworking of an under-appreciated comedy classic . hillary duff does an over sexualized britney spears lap dance version of mata bond . the writers built a little reverse oedipus twist into the plot - interesting choice . i never knew how soothing montel 's voice was until this movie ... i think he has found a new calling doing nav system voice overs !
i did not like chandni bar from the same director . i did not watch his other movies . they came and went . but page-3 is nicely made . seems real . like satya from rgv did . the mental sickness of the so called high society is the summary of the movie . in the midst of all the sickness , its difficult to lead a normal life which the protagonist , konkana sen , does . serious movie , not to be watched with children or expecting wives . page-3 of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities going on in the parties of the rich and elite who indulge in much more filth then what is reported . how this page-3 is also a business prospect is shown in the movie . event management firms get paid to arrange parties and make a rich but not famous people famous overnight by clicking photographs with the celebrities invited to the party . the western culture has crept into the high society of mumabi quite deeply . the movie shows it boldly , no holds barred . madhur bhandarkar starts a new journey from here .
some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing . such is the case for carol 's journey ( el viaje de carol ) , a beautifully crafted 2002 film from spain based on the novel ' a boca de noche ' by ángel garcía roldán who also adapted the book as a screenplay . war and its consequences are not new subject matter for films , but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters ( especially children ) who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults , the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre . carol ( clara lago ) is a 12-year-old spanish american youngster from new york who with her critically ill mother aurora ( maría barranco ) returns to her aurora 's home in 1938 at the height of the spanish civil war , a home that has been left deserted by her father don amalio ( álvaro de luna ) since his wife 's death . carol 's father robert ( ben temple ) is a fighter pilot who has sided with the republicans against franco and is rarely with his family . aurora has a past : she left her lover alfonso ( alberto jiménez ) to marry robert , and alfonso in turn married aurora 's cold sister dolores ( lucina gil ) . carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather don amalio until she meets others her age but not of her 'class ' : tomiche ( juan josé ballesta ) and his two friends at first resent carol , but as events develop carol and tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love . when aurora dies of her illness , carol must live with alfonso and dolores and their daughter blanca ( luna mcgill ) , yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother 's best friend and teacher maruja ( the always radiant rosa maria sardà ) to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side . through a series of incidents carol and tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults , facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime . the ending , though sad , is uplifting as carol 's journey to maturity is complete . the film is shot in galicia and portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer gonzalo f. berridi and enhanced by the musical score by bingen mendizábal . director imanol uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos , and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved , he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war . the cast is exceptional : the stars clearly are young clara lago and juan josé ballesta , but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles . this is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date . grady harp
alan curtis has a loud , violent sounding argument with his wife , slams out of his apartment , has a night of drinking with a mysterious lady with a large hat in a bar ( run by andrew tombes , in a nice villainous part for a change ) , and returns to find his wife dead and the police , led by thomas gomez waiting for him . his attempts to prove his alibi - that he was with that mysterious lady - fall because everyone that he can think of ( tombes , elisha cook ) claims there was never any such person . he ends up with no alibi , although his secretary ( who secretly loves him ) ellen raines believes him . convicted after a trial , he is awaiting his death sentence . raines starts going out after the truth , discovering that gomez has some doubts of his own . she also finds an ally in a friend of curtis , franchot tone , who was apparently out of town the night of the crime . will she clear curtis in time ? the phantom lady is based on a novel by william irish ( the great noir writer cornell woolrich ) . as movie fans know from other works by woolrich ( leopard man , the night has a thousand eyes , rear window , no man of her own ) one can not assume what is true on the surface anywhere . the missing wife of a salesman may not actually be upstate , sending him messages that she arrived , if he still has her jewelry . the mentalist may really be able to predict tragedy - or was he plotting the murder of his old partner , now an oil millionaire ? did a leopard kill the young women , or is the wealthy recluse in town actually hiding some guilty knowledge ? is the young woman , claiming to be the wife of a brother killed in a train wreck , actually an impostor ? here it is raines and gomez ( with an assist by tone ) trying to prove curtis did see a woman nobody will admit seeing - and if he did see her , why is nobody else able to recall seeing her ? the problem with the story really is curtis 's personality - he gives in too easily when found guilty of the crime he did not commit . in reality anyone who is innocent would be screaming it to the moment they are executed . however , in defense of curtis 's collapse , it also happens to other people in various films : gary cooper , in mr . deeds goes to town , gets so disgusted about the framing he gets as delusional and mad by douglas dumbrille and his minions that he does not defend himself at first , until the people who would depend on his help cry out their fears in the courtroom and reawaken his sense of responsibility . but curtis just seems to give up . in normal circumstances raines , gomez , and everyone else would not care if curtis did n't . but the film survives this weakness . the slow unraveling of lies by witnesses bribed by the real killer allows two set pieces for raines with tombes on a deserted elevated platform and elisha cook at a jazz session . gomez turns out to be more perceptive than the villain expects in double checking his alibi again . and the villain manages to keep slightly ahead of raines and gomez until the concluding minutes of the film . if it is not as great a film as double indemnity or the postman always rings twice or the maltese falcon , it holds up pretty well until the moment curtis and raines are reunited at the end .
`` a mouse in the house '' is a very classic cartoon by tom & jerry , faithful to their tradition but with jokes of its own . it is hysterical , hilarious , very entertaining and quite amusing . artwork is of good quality either . this short is n't just about tom trying to catch jerry . butch lives in the same house and he 's trying to catch the mouse too , because « there 's only going to be one cat in this house in the morning -- and that 's the cat that catches the mouse » . if you ask me , there are lots of funny gags in this cartoon . the funniest for me are , for example , when mammy two shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and says sarcastically « i 'm glad you 're enjoying the siesta » and that she hopes they 're satisfied because she ai n't , making the two cats gasp . another funny gag is when tom disguises himself as mammy two shoes and slams butch with a frying pan and then butch does the same trick to tom . of course that , even funnier than this , is when the real mammy two shoes appears and both ( dumb ! ) cats think they are seeing each other disguised as mammy and then they both attack her on the `` rear '' - lol . naturally that she gets mad and once she gets mad , she is n't someone to mess with . but even jerry does n't win this time , because he is expelled by her too .
definitely a very good idea , screenplay was just ok.could have been better , the positives are that it does n't bore you if you 're an adventure lover , a new idea about the lost world of atlantis.negatives are that i personally feel that this idea had so much more potential than this.they should 've ended up with a better adventure than this.it was n't bad at all but it would have been much better with some more runtime.enjoyed it a lot though , cant say that it was boring or was n't good .. a good one for the people who like adventure animations like sindbad , like the road to el dorado.this movie is also recommended for people looking for a nice little adventure with a very nice happy ending .
as soon as i knew keira knighteley being in this flick , i said `` i have to watch this movie '' . she 's the undisputed main character , domino , a bounty hunter . her `` job '' , as the `` no action '' scenes would teach us , reflects her rebel , violent attitude to life . i have to admit that it 's the very first time that i watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters ' hands . so , this stomped me a bit . anyway , for all the john woo 's fans , there are helicopters falling down , explosions , gunfire as if it would rain , and a lovely keira that shoots with two machine guns , one per hand . the cast is absolutely brilliant . going beyond keira , which in this movie is a real tomboy , pretty much different from the lovely action figure we 're used to see , mickey rourke is back , with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body . christopher walken makes his job pretty well , as a reality show producer . let 's go to the contents : this movie has a journalistic shape . the talk show scene is `` disgustingly '' real . anyone that watched that load of . . . you-know-what , can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations . as well as the producer , when domino 's mom says that the reality that should show domino 's life is `` trash ; no offense '' , he answers `` i do n't take it like an offense '' . this movie portrays a difficult life . domino , coming from a world that did n't want her , ed ( mickey rourke ) , a bounty hunter `` not so bounty '' , choco ( the third guy of the band ) , which family is ( using ed 's words ) , `` the correctional institutes he 's been '' , and alf , the driver/bomber coming from afghanistan during the russian occupation . this bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born `` without the shirt '' ; unlucky , violent , and with nothing to lose , excepts their ( as they would consider ) miserable lives . the intro of the movie says that it is `` inspired by true story . . . more or less '' , so i could n't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true . anyway , going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons ( which could have been `` added '' to make the film easier to see , and be classified as an action movie ) , the characters ' story is too realistic to be `` edulcorated '' . the interaction between the characters is various , well studied , and definitely not boring . what has n't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist ( lucy liu , sober as never in her acting career ) . it represents only the reason by which domino starts telling her story ( and that 's a story ) . probably , the only `` con '' , in a movie with a lot of `` pros '' . all in all : this is n't `` swat '' . the characters are crafted ; they have an identity , a shape . they have a name and a surname ( not just `` gamble '' and `` street '' ) . it 's the case to say , it 's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet .
otto preminger 's noir classic works almost as a flip-side of laura ... while that film was glitzy and features the high fa-luting clifton webb , this film is a whole lot seamier . dana andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves . preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked . andrews is quite fine ( a lot less wooden than he 's been in the past ) and the stunningly beautiful gene tierney is stunningly beautiful ! creepy craig stevens plays the unlucky victim . where the sidewalk ends is a must see and a terrific companion-piece to preminger 's equally lurid whirlpool ( also starring tierney ) .
one of the best of the fred astaire and giner rogers films . great music by irving berlin . solid support from randolph scott , harriet nelson , lucille ball , betty grable , frank jenks , and astrid allwyn . terrific songs include `` let yourself go , '' `` let 's face the music , '' and `` putting all my eggs in one basket . '' the last song is introduced by astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with rogers . rogers also sings `` let yourself go '' with grable among the backup singers . harriet nelson ( then hilliard ) sings two nice songs and plays rogers ' mousy sister . `` get thee behind me '' is a song that sticks with you for days . she also sings `` but where are you ? '' snappy and fast paced , this entry in the astaire-rogers series is one of the better ones . the classic and amazing beautiful finale , `` let 's face the music and dance '' is among the best-known of their numbers . rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history .... a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances ( weighted hem ) and is also slightly see through . just gorgeous . this is the number that steve martin and bernadette peters re-created in pennies from heaven . randolph scott seems an odd choice as astaire 's pal but he also appeared in their roberta with irene dunne . luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance . it seems that grable and ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact . allwyn has the bigger role but is only ok. rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with `` let yourself go '' .... jazzy and thumping , it 's a great song . fun all the way , although i got tired of `` we joined the navy '' after the third time ....
another attempt by modern japanese directors to redefine the chambara genre . successful , and not , in varying degrees . buddhist monk has a vision that he is to slay a legendary ( and very active ) demon at the gojoe bridge in order to attain enlightenment . while not at the forefront , buddhist thought is at the heart of this movie , much like kurosawa 's `` ran '' . it probably what made the movie the most interesting to me although it 's nowheres near `` ran 's '' league . stylish visual direction and excellent photography keep the movie mostly interesting throughout the two hour and eighteen minute length . the lead actors are uniformly excellent . the music is really good . the two weaknesses are the story and the fight scenes . the movie drags in the middle which could have been fixed by some prudent editing . and the fight scenes are mostly filmed in blurry close-ups . this works for most of the film but the finale feels like a cheat . another recent film like this is tsui hark 's `` seven swords '' , great film but the promised fight scenes are disappointing . asano really does n't move like a sword wielding demon , his acting is great but he would be an extra in a traditional chambara fight scene . good movie , you 'll probably find it interesting just do n't expect traditional sword fights .
i had seen this movie when it got released , and when i was 12 years old : ) and i still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger : ) and the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain ! i think many so-called action movies copied a lot many `` escape scenes '' from this movie ! ! and not only does it never impress me when i see such copying , it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece ! : ) the lead actors have acted wonderfully . the slow and realistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed . as children , we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very natural : ) the way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations together was something that can make even kids realize the value of true love , sacrifice and caring . i recommend that every person see this movie when given a chance ! ! -- vijay .
red eye is a good little thriller to watch on a saturday night . intense acting , great villain and unexpected action . some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 min 's and 88 % of the movie is on a plane and just talking . do n't worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog . a pg-13 movie seems to be new grounds for director wes craven . but surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller . this movies strongest point is its cast . this film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills . if they did n't have those actors the film would have been lost and boring . we had rachel mcadams from mean girls and wedding crashers . cillian murphy from batman begins and 28 days later . rounding off this cast is brian cox from x-men 2 . the pacing in this film was great . just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you . luckily this is n't a long movie and does n't feel like it either . much better then the other flight movie flight plan . here is my flight plan comment : http : //www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 i recommend . not too long and not too shabby . 8/10
the problem with portraying a real life individual is that the performance can be good , but still not work if the audience does n't believe that the actor is portraying the person . that 's the main issue with `` young mr. lincoln : '' henry fonda gives a terrific performance , but i found it hard to believe that abraham lincoln was as soft-spoken as fonda portrays him . this is essentially a courtroom drama with a young abraham licoln at the forefront . whether or not this was a true story , i do n't know , but if it is n't , then why tell it using lincoln as the central character ? never mind though . in the film , lincoln is defending two young men who are accused of murder . there 's really not much to the film , and as a result , it seems rather empty . i wanted more story and character development . the film is 100 minutes long , but it does n't feel like it . there are some little scenes featuring lincoln and the blooming relationship with mary todd , but they seem superficial . the acting is good all around , but as i said , fonda 's performance works as a character , but not abraham lincoln . i just do n't believe that the real lincoln was that soft-spoken . true , he has a big voice when he needs to , such as when he persuades a drunken lynch mob to let the accused stand trial , but fonda portrays lincoln too meekly . the other performances are solid though , especially alice brady as abigail clay , the mother of the accused . she 's a nice lady who we can really feel for . simple and uneducated , yet very sweet ; we can see why lincoln wanted to help her . john ford seems to think of this film as an epic , and at the time of its release , it probably was . but even then , there 's just not enough material to present it as such . it 's a nice watch , but not a classic .
i saw this movie by luck , just because i was going through a phase where i had a new found admiration for bill pullman and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank god i did ! this movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites ! the story revolves around two girls who embark on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they 'll learn the true meaning of freedom . alice and darlene were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story . the struggle they go through as they are arrested in thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense . the acting is amazing , the images extraordinary , the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message transmitted definitely powerful . i actually ca n't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time i watch it . i know some people have n't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but i swear , this one , you have to see ! ! ! i promise it will stick with you !
i found about the movie `` holes '' by hearing from people that it was n't typical disney , that both kids and adults both got into the story . folks , let me tell you i was n't disappointed . `` holes '' is based on the novel by louis sachar and follows the adventure of stanley yelnats , a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert . he befriends a boy nicknamed zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives . it was a very interesting , unique , different and funny story . i did n't know quite what to expect when i watched it . it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle . the boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and jon voight was just hilarious as mr. sir . now that i 've seen the movie , i have to read the book . most recommended !
i 've long wanted to see this film , being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum . i agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time , but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role . thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week . i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war , especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s . some of the boys are a bit scary . i certainly would n't want to met them on a well-lit street , much less a dark one . there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well , or as they call him , a firefly .
this movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few african americans are aware . my own two children are by products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black skin woman whose parents were ex-slaves . he married outside of and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family except for one sister who took pity on her brothers plight ; raising 8 children during the great depression of 1929 ; providing the family with food whenever she could . of course she clandestinely aided this family fearing for her own ex-communication . my daughter was fascinated by the movie . we have made it a part of our library .
i think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words `` clueless and appalling nonsense . '' i think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment . one has to suspend one 's disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love , have a child and live together happily ever after . but it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one 's heart warmed . is it so impossible ? there are far more implausible events described in other movies . the acting is good , the script is funny . the only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality .
what a wonderful movie , eligible for so many labels it never gets : science fiction , film-noir , with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated , cultured audience ..... the kind of english language movie only done in pre-1960 england ( and shown only in usa art movie houses when it first arrived ) , and never , ever done in the usa . main characters in the man in the white suit ( 1951 ) starring sir alec guiness and joan greenwood routinely use polysyllabic , science reference words like `` polymer '' and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like `` long chain molecules '' and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him . the man in the white suit ( 1951 ) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now ( 2009 ) dominate world cinema , and certainly dominate major usa cinema ....... it 's a carefully acted , intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated english actors ( who play educated , accomplished people ) , and it 's all done with comedy , charm , pathos , and sense of irony which ancient greek dramatists would have approved of . everybody should see this movie , and someday , somehow , some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it . it 's wonderful .
let me say that i love adam sandler , watching reign over me i was paying close attention to his acting when he raises his voice , i cant help but think of happy gilmore yelling at a golf ball , then i snap back as adam sandler sucks me in reign over me is a great film , a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting emotion in every scene don cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an oscar in any movie he does adam sandler was amazing in so many ways not only was this his most dramatic/best acted film of his career . but i can recall laughing out loud at many parts of this film the supporting cast was great also with saffron burroughs and jada pinkett smith i would highly recommend this movie its got tremendous acting beautiful shots of nyc great comedy great drama and a new found respect for adam sandler if you ever doubted him or a reassurance at how great don cheadle is
if any style of film could be called my `` guilty pleasure '' , it 'd be this generic fantasy type . guilty is the wrong word for it , though , as i 'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time . `` stardust '' is good stock fantasy , the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman ( or gaiman adaptation , as it were ) . it is n't the visual dream-scape of mirrormask , it is n't the adult pretension of pan 's labyrinth , and it is n't the fun-loving classic the princess bride , but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing . fantasy lovers should rejoice -- special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now . the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who , in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall , goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star . to make things difficult , however , tristan 's fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine , and he 's not the only one looking for her ... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star 's heart can give , and a brother 's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction . from there it 's all pretty predictable , but it involves some attractive fantasy elements , some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love , and the best part , robert deniro as a gay pirate . on that note , deniro 's performance is spot-on ... it 's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people , but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character ( thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniro 's own opening up into alternate forms of acting ) . deniro has n't been so unique to his own image since brazil , and that 's saying something . stardust is the type of movie , perhaps , that will subsist on children 's and fantasy-lover 's shelves for a long time . i ca n't say it offers anything new , but it 's not really there to . it 's actually those most familiar with it 's tropes that will enjoy it the most . -- polarisdib
awful dreams , wild premonitions , blasphemy and homosexual fantasies permeate paul verhoeven 's ( arguable ) masterpiece of a true femme fatale who loves her men then kills them . filled with blood and occasional gore , the fourth man is truly neurosis inducing . men will literally leap when renee swings out her scissors ......
i saw this movie today and i have to say , it was much much better than i expected it to be about couple of hours before going to see it . personally i had some prejudice due to the language of it , but it did totally change my idea . the movie was in most cases surprisingly good with the great actor and actress performances . it was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did everything to reach it . this really touched me and as a film , which is based on a true story , it convinced me . a new school , psycho headmaster and a young boy who get known with a new teacher , a bit different one than the others and about fighting for the things even if they does n't seem to work out . it showed how little things can make huge changes in many things , and how difference can sometimes cause difficult situations . also i think the actor selections has succeeded perfectly . it really felt like you had been some person watching the episodes as an outsider when they happened . before i spoil this movie with praises , i have to admit that there were some things and situations that did n't look and feel realistic .. like the one where the headmaster of the school beat frits aka . martin in front of the class , at the end of the movie . he really got beaten badly , but the only thing that it caused to him , was some blood coming from the nose when comparing that to the first beating in the beginning , when frits got some stitches .. well i guess every movie has it own faults .. have to say , that if i someday somewhere find this dvd from the store , it 's sure thing , that i take it with me .
i just do n't understand why this movie is getting beat-up in here . jeez . it is mindless , it is n't polished and it is ( as i am reading ) wasted on some . the cast of this movie plays their characters to the 't ' ( if you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed ) . these are misunderstood , well-intentioned misfits trying to save the city/world with nothing but grit and determination . the problem is they do n't realize their limits until the big showdown and that 's the point ! this is 3 times the movie that the spy who shagged me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group , likely the same people who feel the first ap movie pales in comparison to the sequel . i just do n't get it . the jokes work on more then one level ; if you did n't get it i know what level you 're at .
if there was anything akira kurosawa did wrong in making dodes'ka-den , it was making it with the partnership he formed with the `` four knights '' ( the other three being kobayaski , ichikawa , and konishita ) . they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership , and instead kurosawa , arguably the head cheese of the group , delivered an abstract , humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies . had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows , but it was because of this , among some other financial and creative woes , that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 . and yet , at the end of the day , as an artist kurosawa did n't stop delivering what he 's infamous for with his dramas : the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity . that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most should n't be ignored , but it 's not at all a fault of kurosawa 's . the material in dodes'ka-den is absorbing , but not in ways that one usually finds from the director , and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot . there 's things that happen to these people , and kurosawa 's challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole . the character who starts off in the picture , oddly enough ( though thankfully as there 's not much room for him to grow ) , is rokkuchan , a brain damaged man-child who goes around all day making train sounds ( the 'clickety-clack ' of the title ) , only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother . but then we branch off : there 's the father and son , the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site-specific descriptions of his dream house ; an older man has the look of death to him , and we learn later on he 's lost a lot more than he 'll tell most people , including a woman who has a past with him ; a shy , quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father ( or uncle , i 'm not sure ) , who rapes her ; and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife- to those who are social around . there are also little markers of people around these characters , like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night , like clockwork , putting big demands on their spouses , sometimes ( unintentionally ) swapping them ! and there 's the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman . and of course there 's a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum , not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it 's about something erotic with a guy . first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture ; it 's a little post-apocalyptic , looking not of any particular time or place ( that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets ) . it 's a marginalized society , but the concerns of these people are , however in tragic scope , meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force . like bergman , kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people , with one scene in particular when the deathly-looking man who has hollow , sorrowful eyes , sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it . sometimes there 's charm , and even some laughs , to be had with these people . i even enjoyed , maybe ironically , the little moments with rokkuchan ( specifically with kurosawa 's cameo as a painter in the street ) , or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics . but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise , his camera movements still remain as they 've always been- patient but alert , with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots , painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper . amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories , with some of them ( i.e . the father and son in the car ) especially sad , kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in eastmancolor like it 's one of his paintings . lush , sprawling , spilling at times over the seams but always with some control , this place is not necessarily `` lighter '' ; it 's like the abstract has come full-throttle into the scene , where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath . it 's a brilliant , tricky double-edged sword that allows for the dream-like intonations with such heavy duty drama . with a sweet 'movie ' score toru takemitsu ( also responsible for ran ) , and some excellent performances from the actors , and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career , dodes'ka-den is in its own way a minor work from the director , but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms , which as with many kurosawa dramas like ikiru and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality .
this first installment of crispin glover 's personal magnum opus asks you to think a little , and so ca n't be recommended for any viewer who does n't want to sit and puzzle over glover 's imagery or follow the surprisingly simplebut weirdly obfuscatedthread of his narrative . to the more casual viewer , yes , it 's probably going to come off as a confusing mish-mash of odd , startling , and disturbing imagery for imagery 's sake . you get the sense that glover does n't mind that this is the case , and he 'll almost as gladly listen to why someone hated the film as to why they enjoyed it . glover 's innate eagerness for and about his work and how audiences interpret it is strongly communicated not only through the film itself , but also through the unusual question and answer sessions that he frequently conducts following showings ; he clearly hopes that people will continue to think about what he has presented . the easiest way to interpret and dismiss the film is to label it as dada or nihilist , a juvenile attack on the modern movie industry from an actor who 's worked both without and within . but there 's a reason why glover performs his slideshow before showing his movie , and it 's not only to sell books ; his books juxtapose and create a narrative from images and text that glover pieced together , and what is it ? does similarly with imagery drawn from western culture . what is it ? is an endearing and compelling film in ways one hardly expects while viewing . much has already been made about glover 's use of actors with down 's syndrome , and indeed that is one of the most initially striking aspects of the film . so jarring , in fact , that many seem to interpret it as some sort of far-reaching crusade to see a more realistic and/or dignified portrayal of the disabled in movies and televisionor , on the absolute other end of the spectrum , as a kind of direct exploitation of the disabled . but it 's not either , and maybe that 's part of what makes this film so uncomfortable for many : the underlying agenda is not a political one or one of hatred , but one of looking beyond the mainstream culture into a kind of outsider ugliness . it 's not a film about down 's syndrome , but it is a film that is owned by the actors with down 's syndrome who appear in it . i 'm the sort of person who is entirely gung-ho when it comes to ugliness and strangeness being portrayed so starkly that it is beautiful ; happily for me , this is pretty much exactly how what is it ? presents itself to viewers . glover uses the strange images of snails , death , and the disabled in part because he wants his audience to feel discomfort at either the sheer oddness of the imagery or the visceral reaction one has to the dying screams of an anthropomorphized snail . in some ways , the weirdly compelling ( and occasionally downright grotesque ) elements of what is it ? remind me of the work of the painter francis bacon he of the infamous popes , yes , and the odd distortions of the human figure that inevitably make viewers cringe and want to look away . like bacon 's paintings , glover 's film manages to be opulent and humble , grainy and polished , chaotic and well-realized and the contradictions help to make it all the more disconcerting . but still this is not an entirely serious film , and it largely manages to sidestep the greatest pitfalls of pretension through the use of humor that , for the most part , derives from the use ( and juxtaposition ) of familiar items , images , and names of popular culture . and when what is it ? is funny , it is very funny . overall , what is it ? is an impressive first film from glover as a director and writer , and his presence as an actor in the film proves not to be nearly the distraction one might expect it to be . watching it is like being an observer in the kind of dream that is n't exactly good or bad , but just strange and that leaves you feeling slightly grimy when you wake up . if that 's the kind of art you enjoy , what is it ? is likely to exceed your expectations and be well-worth the effort of catching it in the theatre , along with the big slide show and glover himself . all in all , it 's an experience you 're unlikely to forget any time soon .
when this first came out , my dad brought it home- we were amazed by it- it was so different from anything we had seen before . i was looking for a specific movie last night , and i found 'the mind 's eye ' again . the box is falling apart , and i am surprised that the tape still works ! although it is not 'finding nemo ' quality graphics , it is still very good . they should sell this again- it is a landmark for computer animation imagery . highly recommended !
watched this as a late tv movie last night purely by chance . the blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey , as i tuned in there 's the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory - played by daniel craig no less - so the plot was immediately apparent . it turns out that eponymous mother 's carpenter love interest is also the daughter 's boyfriend , so there 's trouble brewing and not too many surprises . but i 'd been caught by anne reid 's compelling performance and i was hooked . the direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves , when she exudes sadness . the sex scenes were fascinating and taboo-breaking . should n't older women 's bodies remain covered up ? not here and we 're treated to a delicious reawakening in the mother 's sexuality . even more startling are the drawings she 's made that ( spoiler ! ) once discovered confirm her daughter 's suspicion that something 's going on here . cathryn bradshaw as the daughter did n't convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast , but that could be me . with her waves of pre-raph locks i kept expecting to see julia sawahla , whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind . bradshaw has a rounder happier face that did n't carry the anger that emerges as the film progresses . the ending is weak . if the goodbyes for mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some close-ups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons . whatever she 's done , she 's a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years , and i found the lack of sympathy jarring . for a film so full of emotion ( and be warned it 's like opening champagne , you 'll never get the lid back on ) the ending is a cold contradiction .
well-done ghost story that will give you the creeps and some pretty fair scares along the way . the story unfolds slowly , building atmosphere all the way until you 're ready to see the woman in black . you wo n't forget her once you 've seen her . no gore , no knives , no hockey masks -- just a well-constructed story that is best viewed at night with the lights out .
a young ( only 21 ) director with great talent , a powerful scenario , young and ambitious cast with all theatrical background ... one of the first tries of a thriller in turkish cinema , which seems in the future we 'll have some more based on the success ... shot on high definition video , the movie is perhaps effected on world thrillers , especially the american thrillers . the technical and cinematographic character is quite well done , the scenes are all well worked on . not too much blood but sufficient enough to make you think you 're in a blood bath too ... the scenario is quite wise but with certain clues , a clever audience can easily predict what 's going on and at the end when everything settles down you 're getting somehow weird to conclude the result . well done tiglon , one of the biggest dvd distributors in turkey , it is not easy to decide for such a movie in their first try as a production company ...
( spoilers ? ) while the historical accuracy might be questionable ... ( and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate lotr .. such things are more easily excused now ) i liked the art ness of it . though not really an art house film . it does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time . i have two complaints . 1 . it 's too short . and 2 . the voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained . 8/10 quality : 10/10 entertainment : 7/10 replayable : 5/10
b movie ? yes . diy ? yes . first movie ? yes . but aestheically a+ . this movie definitely had some bad sound/editing/lighting/acting/etc . etc . problems . however , this movie has many positive things about it . first off , the most annoying character dies first ! second , its made to be a parody/funny b rated horror movie . the comments our killer makes to his victims left me and my friends rolling around on the floor laughing . the problem is a lot of people try to take every independent movie and expect it to be a masterpiece . take it for what it is , a bunch of kids right out of high school made their first movie . for what it is , just that , it is really good .
this is a very good movie . do you want to know the real reasons why so many here are knocking this movie ? i will tell you . in this movie , you have a black criminal who outwits a white professor . a black cop who tells the white professor he is wrong for defending the black criminal and the black cop turns out to be right , thus . making the white professor look stupid . it always comes down to race . this is an excellent movie . pay no attention to the racist . if you can get over that there are characters who are played by blacks in this movie who outsmart the white characters , then you should n't have any problems enjoying this movie . i recommended everyone to go see this movie .
as the story in my family goes , my dad , milton raskin , played the piano for the dorsey band . after sinatra joined the band , my dad practiced with him for hours on end . then , at a point in time , my dad told sinatra that he was actually to good to be tied up with such a small group ( band ) , and that he should venture off on his own . by that time sinatra had enough credits 'under his belt ' to do just that ! dorsey never forgave my dad , and the rest , as they say , is history . i have some pictures and records to that effect , and so does berkley university in california . i have seen just about every sinatra movie more times than i wish to say , and his movies never get old . . . thank you frank
erotic cinema of the 1970 's was tame compared to the triple x romps of today , which is good . because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes . of course , i wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little . plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods , but it 's worth watching the unedited version then the edited up version which is titled the devil 's plaything . but if you do n't care for allot of naked women dancing and having sex , then this is n't the movie for you . however , i did enjoy it and i give it ... 7 stars .
cary grant and myrna loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams . it all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations , both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budget . there are many great laughs ( even if the story is somewhat thin ) sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s hollywood comedy style . a definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses , which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience . as he makes his exit , he assures the client ( grant ) that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of $ 100.00 from the total ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but certainly $ 25.00 . hilarious !
one of my favourite films first saw it when i was about 10 , which probably tells you a lot about the type of humour . although dated the humour definitely has a charm about it . expect to see the usual askey & murdoch banter so popular in its day , with lots of interesting , quirky co-characters . the lady with the parrot , the couple due to get married and are in trouble from 'her ' , and my favourite , the stationmaster , `` nobody knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where it goes .. '' interestingly the ghost train was written by arnold ridley of dads army fame ( private godfrey the medic ) watch it on a rainy sunday afternoon after your lunch and smile .
this is a film which had eluded me thus far but , now that i 've watched it , emerges as one of the major entries in the noir style . as usual with the divx format , the viewing was far from ideal  marred by the occasional video and ( mostly ) audio glitches  but , given that the film is still unavailable on r1 dvd , this will have to do for the moment . since the film 's reputation is quite high within the genre itself , i assume that the reason behind this oversight is because it does not have a well-known actor in the lead . anyway , the belated entrance of the film 's nominal star  franchot tone  packs quite a wallop ( especially as he is shown to be the villain from the first ) ! tone was a underrated actor  he was rarely given meaty roles , and this may well be his best ( making his paranoiac both fascinating and believably dangerous ) . the female lead  ella raines , who would later feature in brute force ( 1947 ) as well as siodmak 's own the suspect ( 1944 ) and the strange affair of uncle harry ( 1945 )  is quite lovely and capably takes on the role of the distraught secretary out to prove her convicted boss ( alan baxter ) innocent of his wife 's brutal murder . other key supporting parts are essayed by thomas gomez as the initially bullying but ultimately sympathetic police investigator , and elisha cook jr.  the genre 's quintessential fall guy  as an ill-fated `` ladies ' man '' of a percussionist . like brute force 's jules dassin , siodmak was on a noir roll at this point in his career and this film definitely benefits from his superb direction  all tilted angles and terrific set-pieces , including the justly celebrated jazz sequence in which cook manically beats on his drums in a sexual frenzy brought on by the sluttishly-attired raines ( who is putting on an act to get his attention and eventually drive him to confess that he withheld evidence at the inquest which could spring her resigned lover from jail ) . another great , lengthy sequence is the one in which raines follows a bartender ( another uncooperative witness ) around the streets of new york  which results in his being mowed down by a car ! notable , too , is the trial sequence  which is entirely depicted through the audience 's reaction so that judge , jury , witnesses and d.a . are never actually seen ( although the judge 's voice is recognizably that of veteran character actor samuel s. hinds ) . the centerpiece of the film is the scene in which gomez and tone discuss the nature of the criminal involved , with the inspector 's put down of the latter as mentally insane giving the initially smug tone `` dizzy spells '' . the suspenseful climax finds raines alone with tone in his apartment , where she discovers evidence of his guilt  and he confesses to having had an affair with baxter 's wife , but killed her when she would n't desert her husband for him . by the way , i hit upon a little goof in the film : while the story is clearly set in 1943 , i noticed that during the taxi cab ride towards the beginning of the film  in which alan curtis escorts the titular lady to the theater  the establishing shot of new york ( comprising clearly of stock footage ) features a marquee promoting laurel and hardy 's 1938 musical comedy , swiss miss ! incidentally , famed mystery writer cornell woolrich wrote the original novel on which this was based using a pseudonym .
in 1990 brad pitt and juiliette lewis did a tv too young to die where both played the almost the same kind of parts that they do in kalifornia . i have no doubt that is what led to their casting in this big screen film . kalifornia finds aspiring writer david duchovny and his girl friend , art photographer michelle forbes on a rocky relationship of sorts due to duchovny 's obsession with writing a book and getting in the minds and souls of serial killers . in fact he 's got a most unusual odyssey planned , he wants to go cross country and visit the sites of several famous serial killers . but he and forbes are flat broke . fate intervenes in more ways than financial with the arrival of brad pitt and juliette lewis a pair of strange southern types who agree to split the cost of gas on this cross country trip . it turns out pitt is a serial killer himself and he decides to do a little research on his own , delving into the mind of someone who is fascinated with amorality . kalifornia is not the type of film i usually go for , but in fact the acting ability and charisma of brad pitt make it work to a large degree . pitt is the walking definition of an inbred gothic refugee from deliverance . but better than he is is juliette lewis who once again is playing these low self esteem types which she seems to do well . watch her scene with forbes as she does her hair and lewis describes her sad and pathetic life . lewis 's dialog and forbes 's reactions ought to be shown in acting classes around the country . for those who like their slasher flicks , they do n't come better than kalifornia .
my discovery of the cinema of jan svankmajer opened my eyes to a whole tradition of czech animation , of which jirí trnka was a pioneer . his ruka is one of the finest , most technically-impressive animated movies i 've ever seen . a potter wakes up and waters his plant . then he goes about making a pot . but in comes the huge hand which crashes the pot and demands that the potter make a statue of itself . he casts the hand out , but soon it returns and imprisons him in a bird cage where he 's forced to sculpt a stone hand . he sets about it , fainting from exhaustion , but eventually completes the task . in a marvellous sequence of metacinema , the potter uses a candle to burn his visible puppet strings , which keep him in thrall , and he escapes back home . he shuts himself in and is accidentally killed by his own beloved plant when it falls on his head . this movie does n't hide the fact it 's pure animation , unlike modern movies that strive to be realistic ( why ? ) . the hand , for instance , is clearly someone 's hand in a glove . everything else is clay . strings are visible and are part of the narrative , making it a precursor of the movie strings . the atmosphere is eerie : that hand going after the little potter managed to instill more dread in me than many horror movies combined . the movie is obvious but it avoids being totally manipulative for its simplicity . it 's a fable about artistic freedom and tyranny which ca n't help winning the heart and mind of anyone who holds freedom as a natural right .
possible spoilers : not sure while watching the lion king 1 1/2 , i could n't help but have mixed feelings about the whole film . it is definitely a good way to spend about an hour and 15 minutes . but there is nothing about it that would give you the same sort of feeling that the lion king did . the story , for those who have n't read the other reviews , is about how timon and pumbaa meet , and how they affect events in the original lion king . there are actually some very funny jokes in the movie . my favorite part is when they show the pair raising simba . however , for me the worst parts have to be when they show timon and pumbaa directly interfering with the events of the original . i can never look at the `` circle of life '' or `` can you feel the love tonight '' sequences the same way again ( i 'm okay with the `` i just ca n't wait to be king '' sequence ) . the voice talents are excellent . nathan lane and ernie sabella do a wonderful job , as do matthew broderick , the guy who does rafiki , and the hyenas . even the actor who does young simba sounded enough like jonathon taylor thomas for me . but why did they even include a voice actor for zazu ? he literally had only 2 lines , and neither were very necessary . the additions of julie kavner and jerry stiller only add to the talent , although you still ca n't hear timon 's mom 's voice and not think of marge simpson . there are some scenes that seem to not fit in with the original , the one coming to mind being when they are pride rock at the end . how did they have time to fit in the initial fight with the hyenas ? as for the dvd itself , you ca n't help but feel that for a 2 disc set , the special features are especially lacking . they could have easily fit a commentary , or another aspect ratio on the 1st disc . i enjoyed the `` who wants to be king of the jungle '' game , even if it is the most shameful example of cross promotion i 've ever seen . some of the questions are actually difficult . overall , a good movie , though not nearly as good as tlk or even tlk2 .
this movie has some things that are pretty amazing . first , it is supposed to be based on a true story . that , in itself , is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall-in nebraska . i wonder if the real town 's name was close to `` blainsworth '' ( which is the town 's name in the movie ) . there is an ainsworth , nebraska , but there is also a town that starts with blains-something . it does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house . on the other hand , the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact . before doppler radar and weather radio , we were taught that if you turned your tv to a particular channel ( not on cable ) and tuned the brightness just right , you could tell if there was a tornado coming . the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it . since i know something about midwest tornadoes , it made this movie fun for me . i enjoy it more than twister . i mean , give me a break-there is no way you could make it through and f5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house .
somerset maugham 's characters are brought to life in rko 's `` of human bondage '' ; but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel , with bette davis ' star-making performance sucking up all of the energy . otherwise , it 's the story of leslie howard ( as philip carey ) ; he dreams of becoming a painter , but is told he has no talent for the arts . as the film progresses , mr. howard 's struggles , instead , to become a doctor . his efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts ; though successful in medicine , his painting seemed easier - also , note the symbolism of his disability , a `` club foot '' ( explained in the film ) . along the way ( right away , in this version ) , howard becomes infatuated with waitress davis ( as mildred rogers ) . davis ' characterization of `` mildred '' is extraordinary , culminating in a spectacular speech , when she tells howard , among other things , that she had to `` wipe my mouth ! '' after kissing him . howard also performs well , but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis ; so , their performances are wasted . still , a film to watch for the acting , including some good supporting players . bette davis ' characterization was famous for inspiring a `` write-in '' campaign for the 1934 `` best actress '' academy award . for the record , she placed third . the results were : 1 . claudette colbert - `` it happened one night '' 2 . norma shearer - `` the barretts of wimpole street '' 3 . bette davis - `` of human bondage '' 4 . grace moore - `` one night of love '' * * * * * * * of human bondage ( 6/28/34 ) john cromwell ~ leslie howard , bette davis , reginald denny
hollow man is one of the better horror films of the past decade . the sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better . the special effects are brilliant and possibly the best i have ever seen in a horror film . kevin bacon proves again that he can handle any role that comes his way . claude rains shocked the world with the invisible man in 1933 , well now , kevin bacon has shocked * us * with hollow man . one of the most thrilling horror films ever . the action is intense and the chills are true . you may actually find yourself jumping if you are watching it in the dark on a stormy night . the supporting cast includes elizabeth shue , josh brolin , kim dickens , joey slotnick , greg grunberg , and mary randle . all of whom do an exceptional job . -- -spoilers -- - dr. sebastian caine ( kevin bacon ) and his team have discovered the secret to making someone invisible . after animal testings , they move on to human testing . but someone has to be the subject . volenteering , caine is turned invisible . but when his team is unable to bring back into visibility , caine is driven mad by his condition as he seeks his revenge ... * end spoilers * the film has created memorable shock sequences and is destined to become a classic well into the next century . becoming the basis for a spoof joke in scary movie 2 , this film grabs you by the throat and never lets go . the first 45 minutes or so are slow , developing the characters and showing how their experiments work . the second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans . think of deep blue sea . then change the sharks into an crazy invisible man . and then change the water into fire and explosions . a rehashing of a killer shark movie . interesting ... hollow man gets 5/5 .
in 1948 this was my all-time favorite movie . betty grable 's costumes were so ravishing that i wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that . douglas fairbanks , jr. , was irresistible as the dashing hungarian officer . silly and fluffy as this movie might appear at first , when i was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about relations between men and women . i saw it again the other day ; i was surprised to find that it still did .
many critics have felt offended that r.w . fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist wilkie and the nazis in this movie in a human-like manner . connoisseurs of other fassbinder films , however , will realize that `` lili marleen '' ( 1981 ) belongs to fassbinder 's `` women movies '' like `` the marriage of maria braun '' ( 1979 ) and `` lola '' ( 1981 ) . fassbinder was convinced that `` stories can be told much better with women than with men '' , because , according to fassbinder , while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society , `` women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner '' . dialectics , however , means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our black-and-white world , but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide . moreover , dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished . concretely speaking : starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state , the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do , and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation , so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender . fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme , that transcends classical logic , in his play `` the city , the garbage and the death '' ( 1975 ) which was filmed by daniel schmid under the title `` shadow of angels '' ( 1976 ) . therefore , approaching an a priori controversial topic like nazi germany , in a dialectic manner , the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial , especially for people who can not or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive light-switch schema , but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis . the mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized , since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones . in a synthetic viewpoint , the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness . they are mutually related . in a world-view based on classical logic , a relation between good and bad can not even been established , and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic , the bad conscience of the survivors of nazi germany , feeling ( illogically enough ) responsible for the deeds of their ancestors , exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well . from fassbinder 's dialectic viewpoint , it follows that neither lili marleen nor lola nor maria braun can be condemned for their `` misuse '' of the ruling system for their private purposes , because they do n't misuse them , they just use them . in the opposite , since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims , because `` good '' and `` bad '' are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two-valued logic , their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world , that is not black and white at all , much better than a black-and-white logic .
the whole point of making this film , one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera , was to make it more accessible to the masses . and it succeeded admirably in doing so . the general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly . hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals ( a young loren , handsome della marra , and a slinky ms. maxwell ) who make the story much more believable , giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be . altogether , an enchanting introduction to one of verdi 's great works . i remember seeing this when i was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera , a form with which i was then not well acquainted . i still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals . luciano della marra was a standout as radames , and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films .
ok , it was a good american pie . erick stifler goes off to college with his buddy cooze . during their arrival they meet up with eric 's cousin dwight . the two pledge to become betas and along the way they get involved with a whole lot of sex , tits , and some hot girls along the way . in a few words there is a lot more sex , nudity and alcohol . it is a good movie for those who want to enjoy an american pie movie , granted it is n't as great as the first three is is a good movie . if you enjoy hot girls with really nice tits , get this movie . if you enjoy seeing a bunch of dudes making assholes of themselves , go to this movie . if you want to see the full thing , get the unrated addition . one last thing this is a better attempt than the last two american pies .
the first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you 're on it in the first place ; then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with . which is exactly what a young latino girl does in ` girlfight , ' written and directed by karyn kusama . diana ( michelle rodriguez ) is an eighteen-year-old high school senior from the projects in brooklyn , facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester . she affects a ` whatever ' attitude which masks a deep-seated anger that threatens to take her into places she 'd rather not go . she lives with her father , sandro ( paul calderon ) , with whom she has a very tentative relationship , and her younger brother , tiny ( ray santiago ) . with her life teetering on the brink of dissolution , she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her . and one day she finds it , without even looking for it , when she stops by the gym where tiny trains . ironically , tiny wants nothing to do with boxing ; he wants to go to art school , but sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets , and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons . when diana convinces tiny 's trainer , hector ( jaime tirelli ) , to take her on , and approaches her father for the money , under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance ( she does n't want him to know what she wants the money for ) , sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money . ultimately , with tiny 's help she finds a way , and the ring soon becomes her second home . it 's an environment to which she readily adapts , and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better . and the fact that she will have to fight men , not women , in ` gender blind ' competitions , does not faze her in the least . diana has found her element . first time writer/director karyn kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story , presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead-end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere . and there 's no candy coating on it , either ; as hector tells diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is , ` i was a fighter once . i lost . ' then , looking around the busy gym , ` like most of these guys , they 're going to lose , too . but it 's all they know -- ' and it 's that honesty of attitude , as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed , that makes this movie as good as it is . it 's a bleak world , underscored by the dimly lit , run-down gym -- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers -- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall , blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have , all that they know . making her screen debut , michelle rodriguez is perfectly cast as diana , infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves . she is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really rodriguez ; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin ? whatever it is , it works . it 's a powerful , memorable performance , by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation . she certainly makes diana a positive role model , one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life , at least to those who would seek them out . as positive as this film is , however , it ends on something of an ambiguous note ; though diana obviously has her feet on the ground , there 's no indication of where she 's headed . is this a short term fix for her , or is she destined to become the female counterpart of hector ? after all , realistically ( and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film ) , professional boxing is n't exactly a profession that lends itself to , nor opens it 's arms to women . and in keeping with the subject matter of the film , and the approach of the filmmaker , an affirmation of the results of diana 's assertiveness would have been appropriate . the supporting cast includes santiago douglas ( adrian ) , elisa bocanegra ( marisol ) , alicia ashley ( ricki ) and thomas barbour ( ira ) . though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify , there are certain aspects of ` girlfight , ' that stretch credibility a bit , regarding some of what happens in the ring . that aside , it 's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience . i rate this one 7/10 .
shocking , well-made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces . small town doctor tries to discover who , or what , is committing a series of violent sexual murders . incubus is a tight mystery , with some horrific murder sequences , that builds to an off-beat and eerie climatic twist . the murder scenes are intense and gory , so this is n't a film for the squeamish ! the direction of john hough , along with a bizarre music score , combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film . it also carries a kind of gothic vibe as well . nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight . the cast is n't bad either . the great john cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town . also good are the performances of kerrie keane as the local reporter , helen hughes as the town historian , and duncan mcintosh as a tormented psychic teen . all around incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re-discovered and re-evaluated . * * * out of * * * *
the movie was totally awesome and cool . the graphics was superb and it was amazing , especially , flik was superb and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent . the circus bugs are colorful and they are superb in the movie . the grasshoppers were also superb and cool in the movie . hopper was a pure and perfect villain . even , dot was cute . when , the bird comes to eat the bugs , that scene was superb and good . even , the last scene was awesome and cool . even , flik 's inventions was good . building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare away the grasshoppers . when , the ants are building the artificial bird , that scene was good and nice i should really appreciate the creators of `` a bug 's life '' .
there is certainly emotion between the two main characters as they explore their relationship -- one based primarily on physical attraction from the beginning . and there is also emotion in the inner-workings of mathieu 's family dealing w/ his mother 's problems -- and how that comes to bear on their relationship . but the problem is it leaves a lot of things unanswered ( unless i 'm just too dumb to pick up on them ) . why is mathieu in a mental hospital ? what led to the boys ' break-up ? and the flashing back between present and past is a little hard to follow at first . it seems like the main reason to rent this movie is to enjoy some homoerotic vicarious thrills , or some male nudity . but as a love story or character study it is lacking and unsatisfying .
billy wilder is co-credited for the story , and his unsentimental touch is noticeable in this quite original tale of ghostwriting songwriters who both work for burnt-out music legend oliver courtney . the obvious misunderstandings are gotten out of the way quite quickly , thank heaven , and what remains is a witty and breezy concoction with some fine songs ( and some more forgettable ones ) , crosby at his most charming , a great turn by broadway legend mary martin and basil rathbone and oscar levant providing most of the cynical barbs ( levant is in rare form and his quips have n't dated at all ) . a delightful surprise , and recommended for all fans of the genre .
family is about two families who are after each other 's blood . viren sahay ( amitabh bachchan ) is an underworld don , operates from bangkok . he has a family in india . once by mistake he kills shekhar ( akshay kumar ) . like viren sahay , he also has a family ( a brother , wife and parents ) . aryan ( aryaman ) , shekhar 's brother is out to take revenge of his brother 's death . he kidnaps viren sahay 's family for the same reason . the film has got one turning point ( amitabh bachchan ) . second half of the movie belongs to him completely where instead of his dialogs , expression matters more . akshay 's minuscule role has also put him at par with amitabh . i did n't understand what bhumika chawala was doing in this movie . there were a few loose points in the script ; like ; amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city still he walks scot-free in the city . kidnapping of his family is also seemed vague . how can the family of such a big don does n't have any security cover ?
this movie was a really great flick about something that affects us all . i know i 've personally run into this many times . thank goodness will smith has jumped onto the societal issue of text messaging while driving . people , do n't do it . an hour and forty five minutes is not enough time for this cause . personally , i wanted to throw away my cell phone after the movie . i was glad to see other people in the theater saw the message and dumped their phones with the empty bags of popcorn . i decided to disable all text messaging on my phone and would encourage others to do the same . if you care about your family , make them watch this vital public service announcement on text messaging while driving or they could kill seven people . thanks for showing us the way .
* * * might not consider this having a spoiler , but i 'd rather be cautious than careless * * * i never saw this movie when i was little . i fell in love with it the first time i saw it with my three year old daughter . i can watch it over and over again . for the little acting ilene woods did in her lifetime , she was a wonderful voice for cinderella ; very appealing ; very believable . the music really fit the movie perfectly . the acting was great ; loved the mice ! ! you really `` hated '' lady tremain and the step-sisters ; they were just awful . the cartoonists depicted the spoiled behavior very well . this is a wonderful movie , especially if you are into love stories . my daughter has seen the movie about 25 times and still gets excited at the end .
'una giornata particolare ' is a movie that has a title that sounds so familiar i thought i had seen it more than once . now that i finally i have seen it , i am very glad . this is one of the better italian movies i know , with one of the most wonderful performances by marcello mastroianni , who stars in other masterpieces such as 'la dolce vita ' and ' 8 1/2 ' , both from the great federico fellini . directed by ettore scola , this is a movie that takes the time to introduce the characters and slowly develops a story on a special day , the day adolf hitler visited rome . marcello mastroianni plays gabriele , the neighbor of antonietta ( sophia loren ) . she is a member of mussolini 's party , pretty fanatic in her thoughts , and he is a member no more . the reason for that i will not reveal . on the day every person from their building , including her husband and children , is out to see hitler , they are still in the building . antonietta 's bird escapes and flies to gabriele 's apartment , and this is how the two meet . right before antonietta went to gabriele he thought of killing himself , again for reasons i will not reveal . how the story develops from here i will not reveal , but it is what happens between the two that makes this such a special day , not the fact that hitler is in rome . like i said , mastroianni has a wonderful performance . you see he is a man who desperately wants someone around him , although at first we do n't know why . may be he likes antonietta , may be he is in love with her , may be there are other reasons . antonietta feels what we feel . what does this man want from her ? she likes the attention anyway . we see how she does her hair to look attractive for the man . loren plays the scenes very good as well . we understand her questions , although we ca n't be sure what her intentions are . the moments where we find out both their secrets , if that is what you can call it , is a great moment . how the story develops from there is even more interesting , but i do n't want to spoil it for you . this is a movie you should see . great performances and a beautiful cinematography , and the message it gives us still stands today .
a couple ( janet and richard ) go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp . after camping and enjoying nature , the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house . soon , a pair of escaped convicts show up and , after much delaying of the inevitable , they proceed to rape janet and lock richard in a birdcage . this last house on the left-like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made . it 's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers . moreover , i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it 's perverse tone . i love caged terror . the music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty . i found the film to be quite creepy . the flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film , which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering . while i did n't mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question , i do think that it will both most people . the acting is n't too good nor is the dialogue , at least in the early scenes . this film takes a little more patience than usual , and it 's really not for everyone . in short , this was a good film . not the greatest horror film i 've ever seen , but it is certainly a lot of fun . it 's not exactly the easiest film to find . it 's possible to find it in the used section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough . it 's not for everyone , but if you 're a fan of trash cinema then it 's definitely worth checking out .
one of the great classic comedies . not a slapstick comedy , not a heavy drama . a fun , satirical film , a buyers beware guide to a new home . filled with great characters all of whom , cary grant is convinced , are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home . a great look at life in the late 40 's .
a slight , charming little movie to be sure , but a superbly-crafted one . gwyneth paltrow shines in this early showcase for her british accent , and the cast assembled around her all lap up the dialogue . this came out around the time of sense and sensibility , and i 'm sure i do n't know why that one garnered all the oscar attention . emma is jane austen 's most accessible and least stuffy story , told well .
zane and beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats . i do n't typically go for military/war movies , but this was worth my time . it was serious , but it was also humorous . beringer 's character proved to be heroic and honest . no matter what , you know that he 's got your back . zane 's character developed throughout the film . he was n't just a suit , he definitely proved that he could be a hero and handle a gun . the ending through me a little though . it did n't really go with the action throughout the film , but i 'm glad that i saw it , nonetheless . it 's worth checking out .
this movie is one of my favourites . it is a genre-mixture with ingredients of the action-/horror-/romantic-/comedygenre . some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards . this minor flaw is easily ignored . there is so much to discover in this story . the romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts . the visuals are beautiful too . the action is great which is no surprise , it is originating from honkong , birthplace of the world 's best action movies . the humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way . somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good . absolutely recommended .
i am right now in front of the tv , watching casomai . it is changing , it id evolving or better ... devolving . it begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love-story is reported . after that everything change , a child was born , and all the rest usually happen in a couple . it is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple , and normality is the center of this movie . it does n't want to show us something particular , there is nothing new , it is just a normal love-story , the story of a couple , and being normal it become different from the rest . it is also a flashing movie , everything is short , every scene is long just some seconds . it is a reported story , many things are known because friends and parents talk about that , and their opinion is central , the opinions create the story and destroy it . it is a simple story of a couple as i said , but it is not boring , it just show a couple , should be everything known , it is , but i am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen , so do n't forget to watch the end !
a warm , touching movie that has a fantasy-like quality . ellen burstyn is , as always , superb . samantha mathis has given many great performances , but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory . most of all , you 've got to see this amazing 5-yr. old , jodelle ferland . i was so captivated by her presence , i had to buy the movie so i could watch her again and again . she is a miracle of god 's creation . judging by the high imdb rating , i 'm not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress .
maybe i 'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever ! i saw it for the first time when i was around 4 or 5 , and i cried my eyes out . between then and now ( embarrassed at age 15 ) i have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them . do n't worry they 're tears of happiness ! and it 's not all sap ! there 's a lot of humor and comedy in it too . usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it 's not the case . my only word of advice : even if you love this-do n't see the sequal ... cornyness ! i suggest everyone checks this out ... you wo n't be sorry , no matter how old or young you are !
the israeli/palestinian conflict persists and while the world may be aware of the violence surrounding the division of the two countries , few have a clue to the other aspect of the division - the group of people who want peace and work toward eradicating the separation . eytan fox , in the bubble ( 'ha-buah ' ) , has created a much needed alternative viewpoint of the schism , electing to tell a story that contains some fine humor , a lot of love , and a taste of brutal reality . it is a window into a situation that begs for understanding . in tel aviv three close friends are roommates : lulu ( daniela virtzer ) , a beautiful young woman with strong opinions ; yali ( alon friedman ) , a very 'out ' gay young man who works in a popular café ; and noam ( ohad knoller ) , a handsome , somewhat shy fellow who , in addition to his day job in a music shop , is a member of the national guard and therefore spends his free time serving as a guard at the city 's checkpoints . it is during one of these guard duty weekends that he meets a young palestinian named ashraf ( yousef 'joe ' sweid ) , and a mutual attraction occurs . the three friends decide to 'stowaway ' the illegally present ashraf ( whom they nickname with an israeli name ) and while ashraf and noam settle into a love relationship , yali hires ashraf at his café , and yali and lulu both proceed to find love interests , too . all goes well until ashraf must return home for his sister 's wedding . though in tel aviv ashraf has been able to be openly gay with noam , life is far different in jerusalem : ashraf is told he must marry his sister 's groom-to-be sister . in an attempt to rescue ashraf from his fate , noam and lulu disguise themselves as french reporters to gain access to ashraf . in a moment of supposed seclusion , noam and ashraf are discovered kissing by the groom-to-be , and this act gives cause for blackmail in order for ashraf to remain 'in the closet ' . while the young people in tel aviv are dancing at an event to raise attention for peaceful coexistence , an attack occurs in jerusalem - one that has grave consequences not only immediately , but also in the revenge mission ashraf must now assume . the ending is tragic on many levels and it underlines just how serious the problem between these two countries is . the acting is so very natural that from both the comedic and the tragic aspects the audience completely believes in these beautiful young people . the story finds the right balance between the serious and the lighthearted and it is this balance than makes eytan fox such a fine writer/director . more people should watch this important and very fine film . in hebrew , arabic , and english with subtitles . grady harp
as a grownup in my mid-40s , i am not even close to any of `` nancy drew '' 's key demographics , but i was pleasantly surprised by the film this afternoon ; so , i could tell , were the pair of sixtyish silver-haired ladies down the row from me . the older man who left the theater just ahead of me specifically praised the film to the 20-ish female usher ( who said she 'd seen the film the previous evening and quite liked it ) . more to the point , however : in the row just ahead of me , there were nine -- count them , nine -- ten-year-old girls lined up next to each other , passing popcorn and hot dogs and candy back and forth and giggling through the previews . once the film began , they promptly settled down to watch .... .... and did n't so much as peep till the closing credits began to roll . this is not a perfect film ; it does n't quite pay off its high school subplots , it 's not quite confident enough of its own tone , and its thugs are just a hair too far over toward critically inept at times . but the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful , the plot hangs together fairly well , and it treads deftly between the sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization . last but not least , emma roberts carries the movie with startling grace -- josh flitter 's superb timing notwithstanding , this is roberts ' movie , and she pulls it off beautifully . her nancy drew is very much the direct ancestor of kristen bell 's veronica mars , and the film is also a lineal descendant of jodie foster 's early and underrated `` candleshoe '' . in today 's marketplace , it 's a rarity : a family movie that respects its viewers ' intelligence . as such , it wo n't be to everyone 's taste -- but for what it is , it is the best movie of its kind in decades .
director paul verhoeven 's american vehicles are of varied quality , but most of the films he made in his native country are indisputable masterworks . this is the story of alcoholic ( and bi-sexual ) writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman . but the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman 's handsome male lover . in the meantime , the writer is plagued with strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse , but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions . fascinating hitchcockian thriller , very original and provocative . i love films that make you think they are about something , but then you realize they are about something completely different . this is one of those movies ; a thriller during the first half , and a quasi-religious surrealist saga during the second half . very erotic , original and blasphemous , not for kids or people that go to church every sunday . great cinematography by future director jan de bont . highly reommended !
first off , i would just like to say what a big fan of bette midler 's i am . stella is a very good movie with a wonderful cast ( bette midler , john goodman , trini alvarado , stephen collins , marsha mason ) this is one of my favorite films of all time . it deals with a mother raising a child on her own , she goes through a lot of things that are out of her way to bring up her daughter jenny played wonderfully by trini alvarado . this movie is very good and i suggest that you pick up a copy to watch it . roger ebert gave is 3 1/2 stars ! and it deserved 4 ! wonderful ! i give it 4 out of 4 !
kim novak 's a witch on the prowl for a mortal lover , and james stewart 's her choice . scintillating comedy of manners , from the broadway stage ; shot by james wong howe in witch color , and performed by a sterling cast . ernie kovacs is wonderful as the perpetually dishevelled writer redlitch . i love this movie , though few others seem to . kim alone makes it a winner in my book . ha ! my # 5 film of 1958 .
it could have been a better film . it does drag at points , and the central story shifts from boyer completing his mission to boyer avenging wanda hendrix 's death , but graham greene is an author who is really hard to spoil . his stories are all morality tales , due to his own considerations of catholicism , guilt and innocence ( very relative terms in his world view ) , and the human condition . boyer is luis denard , a well-known concert pianist , who has sided with the republicans in the spanish civil war . he has been sent to england to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed . unfortunately for denard he is literally on his own - everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the falagists of spain . in particular katina paxinou ( mrs. melendez ) a grim boarding house keeper , and peter lorre ( mr. contreras ) a teacher of an `` esperanto '' type international language . wanda hendrix is the drudge of a girl ( else ) who works for mrs. melendez . the local diplomat , licata ( victor francken ) is already a willing associate of the falangists . the brits ( holmes herbert , miles mander , and best - if not worst - of the lot , george coulouris ) do n't give much hope to boyer 's cause ( which he soon grasps may be britain 's before long ) . herbert and mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the ramsay macdonald 's and stanley baldwin 's governments during the civil war . coulouris here is a typical col. blimp type - always impeccable in his native english diction , he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general . the one ray of hope is lauren bacall ( rose cullen ) , here trying to play her role as well as she can - but she ca n't really . she 's an aristocrat - the daughter of a press lord . it was bacall 's second film , and ( sad to say ) almost sank her long career . she does act well , but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with humphrey bogart and being directed by howard hawks . boyer is a fine actor , but he 's not bogie , and herman shumlin is not hawks . her next film returned her to bogie and hawks again , and her star resumed it 's ascendancy . it 's a bleak film ( as was the novel ) . boyer 's mission never succeeds , as he has too many hidden foes all over the place . but the villains are likewise also losers - frequently with their lives . with dan seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of katina paxinou ( and the man who destroys her ) . it is well worth watching to catch the warner 's lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction .
mario lanza , of course , is `` the great caruso '' in this 1951 film also starring ann blyth , dorothy kirsten , eduard franz and ludwig donath . this is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary , world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today . the film is opulently produced , and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by lanza , kirsten , judmila novotna , blanche thebom , and other opera stars who appeared in the film . if you 're a purist , seeing people on stage smiling during the sextet from `` lucia '' will strike you as odd - even if caruso 's wife dorothy just had a baby girl . also it 's highly unlikely that caruso ever sang edgardo in lucia ; the role lay too high for him . in taking dramatic license , the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of caruso 's life . what was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire , yet this is never mentioned in the film . these roles include maurizio in adriana lecouvreur and dick johnson in `` girl of the golden west , '' there is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga . the reason for that photo ? his only shirt was in the laundry . he was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the victor talking-machine company ( later rca victor ) . he was singing jose in carmen in san francisco the night of the earthquake . instead , the mgm story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of martha , which never happened . he had a hemorrhage during `` l'elisir d'amore '' at the met and could not finish the performance ; he only sang three more times at the met , his last role as eleazar in la juive . what killed him ? the same thing that killed valentino - peritonitis . his first role at the met was not radames in aida , as indicated in the film , but the duke in rigoletto . so when it says on the screen `` suggested by dorothy caruso 's biography of her husband , '' that 's what it was - suggested . what is true is that dorothy 's father disowned her after her marriage , and left her $ 1 of his massive estate . they also did have a daughter gloria together ( who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007 ) . however , caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married dorothy . some people say that lanza 's voice is remarkably like caruso 's , but just listen to caruso sing in the film `` match point '' -- caruso 's voice is remarkably unlike lanza 's . in fact , from his sound , had he wanted to , caruso could have sung as a baritone . he is thought to have had some trouble with high notes , further evidence of baritone leanings ; and the role he was preparing when he died was othello , a dramatic tenor role , which lanza definitely was not . lanza 's voice deserved not to be compared with another . he made a unique contribution to film history , popularizing operatic music . he sings the music in `` the great caruso '' with a robust energy ; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career . his acting is natural and genuine . ann blyth is lovely as dorothy and gets to sing a little herself . really a film for opera lovers and lanza fans , which are probably one and the same .
i did n't even want to watch this movie after reading maltin 's review and 1 1/2 star rating . i watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than i expected . i would give it 2 1/2 stars out of a 4 star system . you have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all . if you do n't know much about religion , you will miss a lot . i graduated from high school the year the movie was made , so maybe i can relate to it better . yes , there is some pretension in the movie and it 's weird to some extent , but that was the 70s so what do you expect . i can see why people might not like the movie ; however , i can not understand people saying it is boring . the movie is anything but boring . you will either hate it or love it . if you find it boring , you are probably brain dead .
mean-spirited , ugly , nasty retro-action thriller , about a bodyguard who is determined to find ( and destroy ! ) , the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect . this film is almost an anachronism in today 's politically correct atmosphere . director scott does n't have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the film 's dramatic structure . scott is either not aware or does n't care for 30 years of social advances . i really do n't think we will see a more violent film any time soon , so you better go and see this one while you can . despite its relentless grimness , i think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister , exploitative , and effective . scott has a tough thing to sell , but i think i 'm a buyer . the extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore . scott 's directorial choices are simply astonishing , and he pulls a great performance out of denzel washington . sensitive souls need to stay away from this one , but i recommended it to those viewers looking for a great , action-filled movie .
man , i really love the new dvd that universal put out . i 've never seen the sentinel look this good since i had to put up with crappy , grainy vhs tapes for years . unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear . and avoid the goodtimes dvd at all costs . it sucks . anyway , troubled fashion model alison parker ( cristina raines ) moves into haunted nyc brownstone , only it 's more than just haunted . it 's also a portal to hell and the vatican keeps an old blind priest ( john carradine ) to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and arch-angels do n't escape . this has an all star cast full of old-timey actors like ava gardner , arthur kennedy , jose ferrer etc ... as well as cameos of upcoming 80s stars including christopher walken , jeff goldblum ( who 's voice was mysteriously overdubbed ) and tom berenger . and you wo n't even recognize jerry orbach from law & order . i had to do a double-take when i did n't quite place where i 'd seen him before . nice gore scenes of alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father 's rotting corpse that 's been possessed by the devil . and there 's a neat ending where disfigured , deformed people try to haunt alison into committing suicide so she wo n't be the next one to guard the portal . it seems alison 's troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the vatican to become the next sentinel . an excellent , creepy 70s classic from director michael winner that should n't be missed . i also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy . 7 out of 10 -
i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me.to tell the truth i think that the younger kevin dillon was hot.hahahaha ... but i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his death '' i was inside you '' .i think that 's what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that she 's too young when he never cared how old the other girls were . ? now i do n't think i myself could ever trust a cop like that.but to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either way.and that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the store.hahahahaha.she was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself and so was the cop who died hello ! ! it 's called back-up.sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things.but that 's what i think an thought about the movie .
overall , i enjoyed this film and would recommend it to indie film lovers . however , i really want to note the similarities between parts of this film and nichols ' closer . one scene especially where adrian grenier 's character is questioning rosario dawson 's about her sex life while he was away is remarkably similar to the scene in closer where clive owen 's character is questioning julia roberts , although it is acted with less harshness and intensity in `` love . '' also note that `` anna '' is the name of both dawson 's and roberts ' character . ca n't be coincidence . now closer is based on patrick marber 's play and supposedly this film is loosely based on arthur schnitzler 's `` reigen '' so i 'm not sure how this connection formed . anyone have an idea ?
i thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for . though it has its confusing parts of the plot , it does n't greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie . that being said , if you 're not open to more liberal political ideas , then this probably is n't the movie for you . i thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding . each character has their funny moments and the audience at the tribeca film festival was laughing throughout the whole thing . i thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area , but that 's intentionally done . john cusack is right in that although it 's set in the future , it really makes you see the present .
the second alternate gundam universe tale ( g-gundam being the first ) , gundam wing is yet another different view into the gundam verse . the familiar elements are found but gundam wing is actually different then its counterparts . the biggest being the gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization . in truth , the series does n't really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict , the eve wars , do n't happen until the later episodes . the greatest positives of this series are it 's characters . all the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in . another great plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series . the designs put some of it 's other gundam counterparts to shame . one of the biggest criticism of this series is how many die hard uc fans claim rip off of the original uc saga . why gundam wing gets this rap when the more apparent uc clone of gundam seed is out there is beyond me . true there are many moments lifted but their told in new ways and there are distinct differences as well . take for example , the usual comparison of zechs merquise and uc icon char aznable . throughout the series , zechs is more the outcast in the alliance and in ways oz as well , while the red comet was shining symbol of zeon . another big difference is the fact zechs loses a lot soldiers under his command hence the other nickname he 's given in the early episodes : `` killer of his own men . '' char is n't given this label . the problems with this series is n't the philosophy mumbo jumbo but two problems . the first is the reused animation footage of the gundams attacks . sure it 's fun seeing heavy arms attack tanks , ms , and planes the first time . but on it 's fourth re-use scenes like this do get old . the second problem is that the entire series is supposed to take place during an entire year . if you really think about all the events springing in the series , a lot happens in just one lone year . but i guess you can easily dismiss this fact when ignoring the intro 's first lines every so often . as it ranks , this is probably the best of the alternate universe gundam tales and a great introduction into the gundam world . after all , this was the very first gundam anime to air in the us television .
as with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s soylent green has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is . overpopulation means there ` s too many people to feed ? i was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies . stalin ` s policy in the soviet union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was mao ` s rural policy in china which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s . and let ` s not forget the great famines in the horn of africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation . you might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on earth , hong kong and macau , have never suffered a famine in modern times . likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn ` t strictly down to overpopulation - it ` s down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside ( it ` s a symptom of industrial progress - not of too many births ) so the image of the streets of new york city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughable but don ` t be fooled into thinking soylent green is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because i consider this to be the best ecological film of the 70s . it plays on the contempary audience ` s knowledge of the world where sol and thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit , brandy and fresh meat . thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky , puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line `` if i could afford it i ` d smoke two , maybe three of these a day `` . but it ` s the visage of the euthanasia chamber that ` s memorable as thorn gazes at the images of wild animals , flowers , running water and snow covered mountains , a world thorn ` s generation has never known . this is a very haunting scene which makes soylent green a very memorable film , combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of edward g robinson as the wise old jew sol roth
of watching this as a child . although i 'll probably find it god-awful now , it was kind-of spooky stuff as i was only seven or so . i also recall working on a saturday-afternoon puzzle while watching it , so i was n't really paying much attention . however , the scene with the rolling boulders has been burnt into my mind ever since . i 've asked numerous people if they 've seen this flick but to no avail . 12 years ago , one person mentioned that , possibly , he had seen it , but he thought it merely a dream ; a fanciful piffle like wind . it 's no dream , my friend . no dreaming now . again , i have n't seen it since then , but i ca n't wait to find a copy and stuff it into my vcr . anything that can stay embedded in my mind 's eye for 23 years deserves a '10 ' .
this movie answers the question , how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is codependent , clinging , needy , jealous .. and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women ? without spoiling the movie , i can safely assure you it does not , but there 's great fun to be had along the way . uma thurman is perfect as the mercurial super-heroine , an uber-babe , mysteriously named g-girl , who unlike most in her sisterhood , is not * always * dedicated to truth , justice , and the american way . thurman is also believable as the thoroughly daft , yet somehow still fetching , curator jenny . when she is dumped for a less endowed but more emotionally secure and well adjusted rival , g-girl goes ballistic , and what follows is not pretty . it 's funny , but it 's not pretty .. it 's a delightful premise , hell hath no fury like a super-heroine scorned , and those involved do n't altogether carry it off , but it has its moments , and i think i 'll get the dvd . i liked this movie ..
ladislas starewicz 's curiosity with insects and cinema melds into a short film about a love triangle between mr. beetle , an artistic grasshopper , and mrs. beetle . the rather simple story of an adulterous beetle couple that both seek stimulation outside their marriage is similar to a biograph or vitagraph short of the time . starewicz 's twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in frame-by-frame animation . the story builds as mr. beetle is unknowingly caught on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper . when mr. beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend , he chases her around angrily , but eventually forgives her and takes her out to see a movie . however , mrs. beetle soon learns of her husband 's infidelities as the movie they watch is the jealous grasshopper 's footage of mr. beetle and the dragonfly together . mrs. beetle thrashes mr. beetle with her umbrella , mr. beetle jumps through the screen , and they both end up in jail after the projector they wreck catches on fire . the insects are placed in humanized settings such as a house or a nightclub , and are given human characteristics of jealousy , anger , lust , and revenge . the insect characters carry briefcases , drive motorcars , and even wear shoes yet they also twitch their antennae and open and close their mandibles as real insects would . the novelty of the story does n't wear itself out , even after multiple viewings , but as fluid as the movements are , the film moves slowly . action happens with intricate detail , but rapidity and a quicker pace of filming is lost in the process . despite its pace , the film is an excellent example of starewicz 's early puppetry and is highly recommended .
this movie is one of the most underrated movie of its time . when watching this movie , your filled with action , and when somethings not really happing , the humour is un matched . brilliant writing for a movie that was made to give us a bloody mix , of a game show where criminals are the contestants , and a near future where the general public all have a thirst for blood.also arnold does n't let us down with some of his best one liners.i do n't want to spoil anything for you , but i will tell you when arnold gives his `` i 'll be back line '' he gets the best response of them all in this movie . hope you enjoy this gem as much as i did .
this film takes you on one family 's impossible journey , and makes you feel every step of their odyssey . beautifully acted and photographed , heartbreakingly real . its last line , with its wistful hope , is one of the more powerful in memory .
this excellent drama had me in suspense the whole time . i could not take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word kept connecting the pieces to this puzzling murder . this movie really touched me because it showed how sad and hard life can be . i really did cry in the end ( which i do n't want to give away ! ) it also let me realize how cruel and sickening people can be when it comes to murder . the cast was also very good . the only bad cast member was the actress who played anne marie . the actress did a great job , but the director did n't . i say this because he found someone who did n't look a single bit like anne marie fahey herself .
certainly any others i have seen pale in comparison . the series gives balanced coverage to all theatres of operation . no one country is given undue credit for the allied victory . laurence olivier brings great weight and dignity to his role as narrator .
for those who think of dame may witty as the kindly , slightly batty , old lady from hitchcock 's the lady vanishes , this movie requires an adjustment . here , she 's anything but kindly or batty . instead , her son , george macready is the loony one . just do n't give him a knife , otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe . now we know what he has in mind for the trapped nina foch if he can just get out from under mother 's domineering hand . really tight little woman-in-danger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout . the script never strays from foch 's dilemma . she 's held prisoner in a big old gothic house on the edge of an angry sea . they 're going to kill her , but why . her predicament makes no sense . the tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another , but even strangers seem against her . we begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from her . director joseph h. lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so . then too , watch foch run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top . witty too shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her wacko son in line . my one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events . nonetheless , it 's a good , nerve-wracking way to spend a little over an hour , courtesy columbia studios .
this is a brilliant political satire . no wonder why it was largely ignored in the u.s. : it exposes our murderous foreign policy for what it really is . another good film from this era , rendition , was also totally dismissed simply because it showed , accurately , that the u.s. is a war machine bent on torturing , murdering , and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination . a clever plot , good acting , some big stars ( john cusack , ben kingsley , marisa tomei anyone ? ) and some scenes of hilarity should have made this movie a hit . unfortunately , americans do n't like to hear the truth about themselves , especially when they are complicit in mass murder .
the film 's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country ( u.s. ) . we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film . befittingly , the obvious of student v.s . teacher is present . but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships : male v.s . female , white v.s . black , and the individual v.s . society . but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v.s . himself . i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus . most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other . this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides . it did not attempt to show how either was right , although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive ( quite obvious towards the end ) . the film also discusses sex and rape . it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together , for a time . lawrence fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps . he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive . other stars that make this film are omar epps , ice cube , and jennifer connelly . michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance . tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act . higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper . in fact , i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other , rather than some dry book , as the real education at a university . it is a life-learning process , not a textual one . i think you 'll find `` higher learning '' is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general . 8/10
i read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about liebe des totes ( the love of the dead ) or something similar . this of course awoke my curiosity so i ordered nekromantik 1 & 2 and der todesking ( the death king ) . the nekromantik movies are ok , even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject necrophilia ( even if they obviously are horror-opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind , they are actually quite funny . ) todesking , on the other hand is , in my opinion , one of the best films ever made . it consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death . death as an enemy ; death as a reliever , death as the very fysical decomposition of the body . the film is a metaphor over life . it shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are . it reduces its viewers to the childs they ( we ) actually are . the fact that we can not really understand the nature of death , and hence neither the process of dying , is the core message of the film . this is a most realistic film . never does buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever . no matter what moral standards you set up , death is unevitable , and will sooner or later be not a fiction but your reality . this applies to you , dear reader , like it applies to the viewers of the film . some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this , which is fully excused , since they of course will live forever ... this is no exploitation movie . why ? because death does not exploit us humans . it harvests us . we grow for seven days , then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre-birth , that is death . buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales . whether you choose to regard it as `` optimistic '' or `` pessimistic '' is up to you . at first glance it may seem very dark . consider though , that in order for something to live , something else must die . `` who wants to live forever ? '' i believe that when buttgereit shows a body , that are being consumed by maggots , he shows not only decomposition , but generation of new life . is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil , than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre ? when you realize this , you see der todesking it its right context . sieben tage hat die woche , siebenmal letzte stunden . seven are the days of week ( weak , mortal ! ) , seven times the last hour . dont fear the reaper , buttgereit tells us , because the reaper takes only what is ripe . and apples that are not plucked for food will rot ! have a good life , fellow imdb'ers ! ( and watch this film , that compares only to ingemar bergmans `` the seventh seal '' in terms of depth and universality )
i see a lot of really negative posts by people who wrote in august , though the movie was not released in the us , at least , until the middle of september . maybe these are unhappy expats living in s. korea who saw it early . i am in the us and just saw it today . i thought the special effects were excellent , better than the trailer . the story was non-western , but i think we are all used to this from many other movies . it was n't at all hard to follow . the acting by the leads was weak , but other people were quite good . there was humor throughout , too . i rated it at 8 because i had a good time watching it , which is what i went for .
homelessness ( or houselessness as george carlin stated ) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school , work , or vote for the matter . most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism , the war on iraq , pressuring kids to succeed , technology , the elections , inflation , or worrying if they 'll be next to end up on the streets . but what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home , the entertainment sets , a bathroom , pictures on the wall , a computer , and everything you once treasure to see what it 's like to be homeless ? that is goddard bolt 's lesson . mel brooks ( who directs ) who stars as bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival ( jeffery tambor ) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries ; if bolt succeeds , he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings . the bet 's on where bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he ca n't step off the sidewalk . he 's given the nickname pepto by a vagrant after it 's written on his forehead where bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of molly ( lesley ann warren ) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home , and her pals sailor ( howard morris ) and fumes ( teddy wilson ) who are already used to the streets . they 're survivors . bolt is n't . he 's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it 's fight or flight , kill or be killed . while the love connection between molly and bolt was n't necessary to plot , i found `` life stinks '' to be one of mel brooks ' observant films where prior to being a comedy , it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as blazing saddles , young frankenstein , or spaceballs for the matter , to show what it 's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they do n't know what to do with their money . maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like monopoly money . or maybe this film will inspire you to help others .
i know a lot of people do n't like this movie , but i just think it is adorable . there 's not much i can say , but the movie is a feel-good movie i guess . the songs are beautiful , the costumes are beautiful , the voices are beautiful , and there are a lot of funny lines in the movie , especially as briggitta learns about the do 's and do n't 's of society . if you like musicals , i 'd say you 'd like this one !
down to earth is the best movie ! ! ! it is so funny , and it 's really sweet too . it has a good plot and it 's unique . it is n't like those movies that are all the same with the similar story lines , and it 's not all comedy and no story . this movie also has a very good ending .
i saw a preview of freebird at the isle of man tt as i had heard about it in a couple of motorcycle mags . although i was over mainly for the racing , the lure of seeing phil daniels in a motorcycle movie ( yes i love quadrophenia like everyone else ) proved enough to get me away from the beer and partying . at last ! we 've done it ! us british have actually made a great motorcycle film ( and no it 's not like torque ) this is up there with the best of british comedy . mark my words , this is phil daniels best screen performance , and as far as geoff bell is concerned , there 's a new british legend making his name felt . i loved gary stretch in shane meadows ' fantastic dead mans shoes and here he gives a quietly touching performance that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation . this is a film not just for us bikers , but i think for everyone ( even my girlfriend loved it ) . i hope it gets the same brilliant response on the mainland as it got at the isle of man . i 'm not going to go into the details of certain classic scenes that this movie has , ( watch out for the shop ) , as it would spoil the fun , but i would say , go see , enjoy , and have one of the best nights in the cinema you 've had in a while . i really think this could well be a cult classic . as they were saying at the tt ... c'mon freebird !
it ran 8 seasons , but it 's first , in early 1959 , and it 's last , in the autumn of 1965 , were shorter than seasons 2-7 . cbs chief william paley canceled rawhide 's production after watching the 1st show of season 8 , in september , 1965 , because he disliked the series without eric fleming as gil favor , who had departed after season 7 . the last new episode aired in november , 1965 . the lone 1966 cbs broadcast , on january 4 , 1966 , was a rerun . i have often wondered why rawhide did n't switch to color filming for it 's last season ? most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965 . cbs was broadcasting in color that autumn , for many of their sitcoms , but westerns like gunsmoke and rawhide remained in black and white . gunsmoke was the last western ( and last prime time network series to switch to color ) on september 17 , 1966 , for the episode snap decision .
an absolute classic ! ! the direction is flawless , the acting is just superb . words fall short for this great work . the most definitive movie on mumbai police . this movie has stood the test of times . om puri gives a stellar performance , smita patil no less . all the actors have done their best and the movie races on thrilling you at every moment . this movie shakes your whole being badly and forces you to rethink about many issues that confront our society . this is the story of a cop ( om puri ) who starts out in his career as a honest man but ultimately degenerates into a killer . the first attempt in bollywood to get behind the scenes and expose the depressing truth about mumbai cops . kudos to nihalani ! ! after this movie a slew of bollywood movies got released that exposed the criminal-politician-police nexus . thus this movie was truly a trend setter . this trend dominated the hindi movie scene for more than a decade . this movie was a moderate box office hit . a must-see for discerning movie fans .
full moon high ( 1981 ) 3 of 5 dir : larry cohen stars : adam arkin , ed mcmahon , roz kelly tony ( arkin ) is your average ordinary high school guy . prepping for the big homecoming game , girlfriend trouble and growing hair in strange places you know the usual . but the hair in strange places part gets a wee bit out of control when a trip to transylvania with his father ( yes ! mcmahon ) leaves him with a wicked case of the furballs . now doomed to walk the world forever young as a werewolf how will adam get any girls ? 'full moon high ' is not often talked about but it is a silly and entertaining horror spoof . larry cohen ( q the winged serpent , the stuff ) incorporates as many gags as he can possibly come up with as writer / director . arkin ( h20 : halloween , 20 years later ) shows nice timing in the lead role . if you happen to be a fan of spoofs like 'airplane ' and 'student bodies ' i think you 'll have fun with this chuckle-fest .
yes , this production is long ( good news for bronte fans ! ) and it has a somewhat dated feel , but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you wo n't want to watch any other versions ! timothy dalton is edward rochester ... it 's that simple . i do n't care that other reviewers claim he 's too handsome . dalton is attractive , certainly , but no pretty-boy . in fact he possesses a craggy , angular dark charm that , in my mind , is quite in keeping with the mysterious , very masculine mr r. and he takes on rochester 's sad , tortured persona so poignantly . he portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it , but also displays rochester 's tender , passionate , emotional side as well . ( imo the newer a & e production suffers in that ciaran hinds - whom i normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout . i 've read the book many times and i never felt that rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast . ) when i reread the novel , i always see zelah clarke as jane . ms. clarke , to me , resembles jane as she describes herself ( and is described by others ) . small , childlike , fairy ... though it 's true the actress does n't look 18 , she portrays jane 's attributes so well . while other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional , one must remember that the character spent 8 years at lowood being trained to hold her emotions and `` passionate nature '' in check . her main inspiration was her childhood friend helen , who was the picture of demure submission . although her true nature was dissimilar , jane learned to master her temper and appear docile , in keeping with the school 's aims for its charity students who would go into 'service ' . jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich mr. rochester . she would certainly * not * speak to him as an equal . even later on when she gave as well as she got , she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer . nevertheless , if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles zelah-as-jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-tempered . the chemistry between dalton and clarke is just right , i think . no , it does not in the least resemble hollywood ( thank god ! it 's not a hollywood sort of book ) but theirs is a romance which is true , devoted and loyal . and for a woman like jane , who never presumed to have * any * love come her way , it is a minor miracle . the rest of the casting is terrific , and i love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here . so , too , is much of the rich , poetic original dialogue . this version is the only one that i know of to include the lovely , infamous 'gypsy scene ' and in general , features more humor than other versions i 've seen . in particular , the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful ! jane eyre was , in many ways , one of the first novelized feminists . she finally accepted love on her own terms and independently , and , at last , as rochester 's true equal . just beautiful !
i have n't seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty . i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of braveheart . it is simply more realistic and has more believable characters . ridb roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like , messy hair and beard with simple clothing . also the liam nesson has a celtic look about him , he looks like a scot and more importantly looks like rob roy . it 's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace . gibson is supposedly playing a man who 's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter . the story contains a little romance , conspiracy and an underdog story . sound anything like braveheart ? but instead of a film that cries out `` freedom '' , liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour , love and justice . this makes it a more interesting film . much like gladiator . the cast is fantastic and liam nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour . the story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity . the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic . this is something a heroine in braveheart would never do . overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch . go and see it !
sidney stratton is having trouble maintaining jobs at various textile mills mainly because of his experimentation in the textile laboratories . stratton 's experimenting on a formula for a new fabric which would create the ultimate fabric , one that never gets dirty , never wrinkles , or wears out . when stratton eventually creates the fabric he creates enemies in all the textile workers ( who will lose their jobs ) and the owners ( who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights ) , so stratton in his white suit becomes the most hunted man in england . the film is ideal and only ealing could have made it so . guiness ' performance ( and a great supporting cast such as greenwood , thesiger , and parker ) and mackendrick 's direction make the film a delight , but the real hero is the story itself , a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama , romance , and suspense . rating , 8 .
since the start of her career in the 70 's and vastly throughout the exuberant 80 's , elvira ( cassandra peterson ) has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror & bad monster movies . while ms. peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures , covering a wide variety in genres , it was her tv-character elvira that brought her the most fame . part of her charm  and respect from the fans  lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous ( unlike many other big name actors & actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their `` early '' work ) . i 've seen only bits & pieces of her tv performances , but her cameo role in ghoultown 's recent tribute song `` mistress of the dark '' really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff . one thing had been clear to me already long before this music video : over the years , elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid-80 's came around . and in 1988 , after films like `` fright night '' and `` terrorvision '' incorporated homages to and spoofs on her tv-work , it finally happened : `` elvira , mistress of the dark '' , the motion picture . now , i had seen the trailer for it already back in the vhs rental days , but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film . a few years ago , i did manage to watch `` elvira 's haunted hills '' ( made in 2001 ) , but for some reason it did n't impress me all that much . was it really that forgettable , or should i give it another watch ? i actually really do feel like re-watching it now , as this first elvira film from '88 really convinced me . though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work , might be sam egan and john paragon with their contributions to the script , there really is no way to deny it : cassandra peterson has a great feel for comedy ( she also co-wrote the screenplay ) . when elvira learns she 's one of the beneficiaries of a great aunt ( she never heard of before ) , she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in las vegas . out to claim her rightfully inherited money , she travels to a quiet new england town . but the uptight townspeople of falwell are in for a treat . in less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her ( often unintentionally ) provocative behaviour . to make things worse , her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected : a rundown mansion , a cookbook and a poodle . but what she does n't know , and her evil uncle vincent albot does , is that her great aunt was a witch , and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable . and if you have n't turned off the movie yet by the time elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe-book , then rest assured , you 're going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face . it 's surprising how a script rigged together with boob-jokes , witty one-liners , movie references , inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story . simple , of course , but coherent . while other movies , heavily relying on gag-like situations , often make you loose track of the story completely ( like the `` naked gun '' films , for example ) , this film does n't . a lot of horror-comedies were being produced during the 80 's , but not a lot of them actually worked . let alone a horror-spoof that does n't derail at some point ( `` killer party '' , although i 'm grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale ) or becomes too tedious too quickly ( `` saturday the 14th '' ) . although `` elvira '' is more comedy than horror , it does n't loose track of what it 's doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale , complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of falwell between newborn witch elvira and evil uncle wizard talbot , including a real honest-to-god witch hunt and elvira 's very own burn-at-the-stake moment . i 'm telling you , there 's no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny . one of the first giggles i got was during the opening credits already , when daniel greene 's name appeared . daniel who ? oh yes , i recognized his name ( and later on his dim-witted macho-face ) . how can one not forget daniel greene once you 've seen ... `` atomic cyborg aka fists of steel '' ! but if you have n't seen `` atomic cyborg '' , then i 'm sorry , but you wo n't be able to laugh with his face in this one . and on a side-note : i never could have imagined elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station . even robert rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better .
i 've read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life ( eg what it takes to get into music school ) , britney bashing , etc , etc . so let 's focus on the movie and the message . i have rated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age range 8 to 14 years , and for a family movie . for the average adult male .... 2 out of 10 . i like pop/rock music , i 'm 45 . i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews . i did n't recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any 'self promotion ' . i watch movies to be entertained . i do n't care about casting , lighting , producers , directors , etc . what is the movie and does it entertain me . i watched this movie for the message . the world 's greatest epidemic is low self-esteem ( which is a whole other story ) so watched with the message in mind , as that is an area of interest . the movie is light , bright and breezy , great for kids . i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up/do n't give up message , so yeh , it was a bit predictable . great message though ... should be more of them . this movie is a great family movie , but for a bloke watching by himself , get hannibal .
this is a story about shin-ae , who moves to milyang from seoul with her young son jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband . her husband was born here , and she is opening up a piano school , but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death . if that is what the film was about , it probably would have been like a hollywood film , with her falling for some local guy and being happy with her son in their new home . but , this is not hollywood . her son gets kidnapped and murdered , ostensibly because it is known she has cash from the settlement . the grief process , attempts at moving on , attempts to clear her conscience of guilt , are all done admirably , and the lead actress is superb . the only caveat , and it has to be stated , is that this is a depressing film . you have to know that going in . you want shin-ae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness . again , this is not hollywood , it is korea and in korean cinema , especially drama , they pull no punches . life is what happens to you . great acting , but sometimes a tough film to watch , due to the goings on . if you stay , you 'll be rewarded . do that .
i have seen this movie many times and each time i watch it i ca n't help but be entertained by it . gunga din is one of those classic movies made in hollywoods golden years when the actors themselves had to draw the audience into a movie without relying on fantastic special effects and man made `` monsters '' to carry a scene . the onscreen charisma and comraderie demonstrated by cary grant , victor mclaglen and douglas fairbanks jr. is suberb and very entertaining to watch . the tongue and cheek attitude in which the three actors play their roles works beutifully and flawlessly . some might consider it `` corny '' but i consider it `` classic '' filmaking and acting at its best . one must remember when watching this film that europe was involved in a war with germany and audiences went to the movies to escape from the horrors of war and to be entertained and taken away to a place where people were larger than life and did heroic deeds and good would always conquer over evil . gunga din accomplishes this perfectly by letting the audience laugh at and with the actors during their harrowing escapades . in short , its a classic film that doesnt take itself too seriously and doesnt want the audience to either .
this one-minute film is arguably the first movie ever made . other inventors had previously filmed actions - like edison 's motion photography of a sneeze - but the lumiere brothers developed equipment that tremendously advanced the medium . at the time , of course , their ` cinematograph ' must have bewildered their peers , including their subjects . in this first instance , the brothers record employees leaving their factory , some of whom understandably struggle to hide their awareness of the camera . the lumieres attempt to make the film more entertaining by introducing animals and a bicycle , but ` la sortie des usines lumiere ' does n't nearly match the ingenuity of their later films . the most interesting aspect of this short film is the brothers ' selection of a familiar working class ritual as their subject . their choice is the initial evidence of their curiosity about all of the world 's people , a quality that makes viewing their experiments immensely rewarding and fascinating today . rating : 8
hot millions is a great movie in every way . a fun , offbeat story with wonderful performances by four of the best professionals ever to work in the business . peter ustinov is brilliant , as usual , and maggie smith -- -definitely one of the greatest actresses of all time -- - is a total delight . karl malden and bob newhart round out the cast and are also perfect . if you want a movie that has perfect casting , this is it . what is so impressive is the way these people work off each other in such a natural and effortless way , creating lots of laughs and fun moments throughout . peter ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and this is one of his most memorable performances . the direction , photography , and editing are also first-rate , and it 's a great time capsule of london in the '60s . it 's definitely on my all-time favorites list .
amongst the standard one liner type action films , where acting and logic are checked at the door , this movie is at the top of the class . if the person in charge of casting were to have put `` good '' actors in this flick , it would have been worse ( excepting richard dawson who actually did act well , if you can call playing yourself `` acting '' ) . i love this movie ! the running man is in all likelihood god 's gift to man ( okay maybe just men ) . definitely the most quotable movie of our time so i 'll part you with my favorite line : `` it 's all part of life 's rich pattern brenda , and you better f * * * * * g get used to it . '' ahh , more people have been called `` brenda '' for the sake of quoting this film than i can possibly imagine .
`` stories of the century '' was a half hour series and appeared in first run syndication during the '54-'55 television season . it was also the first western tv series to win an emmy award . starring veteran western actor jim davis as railroad detective matt clark , the series set clark and his fellow railroad detective partners ( mary castle as frankie adams for the first half of the season and kristine miller as `` jonesy '' during the second half ) against historic western outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid-1860 's to the early 1900 's . the series was very satisfying , easy to watch , and fairly realistic due mainly to the easygoing charm of jim davis in the lead role . he seemed like an actual western character . one other note . when matt clark would arrive in town after a long ride he actually looked like he had been on a long horse ride as he would be covered in dust . a very good early adult western .
a surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad . a great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a twin peaks-ish influence in director dahl . nicholas cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind looking for the right thing to do . j.t . walsh ( rip to a great actor ) is always a wonderful villain , as is dennis hopper . it 's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz . i 'm sure he has his followers , though . in all , this is a great film that shows you that you do n't need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film .
simple story ... why say more ? it nails it 's premise . world war 3 kills all or most of the human race and we 're viewing 2 of the survivors . the message is that the 2 warring sides should not have been at odds in the first place . distilled down to representatives from each side , we see they have everything to come together for : security ... finding resources ... food , shelter , etc ... survival ... love ... at the end they 've decided to pool their resources , ( she finally does ) , so they will survive . simple story , expressed in the limited budget of the early 60s television landscape . we see it in 2009 as somewhat old and maybe predictable . in the early 60s , no one had seen such stuff ... i give it a 10 ...
lost is an extremely well made tv series about some people that are lost on an island . there 's so many twists and turns that you ca n't really decide who your favourite character is , one minute its him then he does something so he 's coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like noooooooooooooooooooo ! ! ! ! ! ! so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait . suspense , action , romance , humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about . so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably better . ( i have a review on that too that you could check it out . ) i would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable , you never know what will happen next .
verry classic plot but a verry fun horror movie for home movie party really gore in the second part this movie proves that you can make something fun with a small budget . i hope that the director will make another one
the only reason i saw this movie was for jimmy fallon , who i 've had a crush on since 9th grade , which was his first year on snl . i am a die-hard yankees fan , and i did n't find the movie painful until the last 15 minutes , when they begin showing clips of the alcs games . i had to cover my ears and make small noises so i would n't have to hear that which must not be heard , but otherwise it was completely bearable . i thought jimmy played the role very well , because the character was supposed to be nervous and quirky , and he is a nervous and quirky guy . i know that it may not be a academy award-winning stretch , but the movie is just a light , fun , romantic comedy that is actually appropriate for both women and men to see . jimmy and drew worked well together , and they had much better chemistry on camera than other actors in the past . ( ed burns and angelina jolie in that stupid movie ? what ? ) i think jimmy has a positive career ahead of him , and thank goodness , because taxi could have killed it . i think fever pitch will help him out a lot . everyone needs to stop being so critical of his acting ability because he is just starting out in movies . i imagine it must be difficult , and if you look at any of the other great actors of our time ( tom hanks , russell crowe , etc ) you 'll see that they started off in some flops . busom buddies ? australian soap operas ? here 's wishing jimmy a successful career on screen . i never wanted him to leave snl but what can you do ?
`` zu : the warriors from magic mountain '' was and is an impressive classic ! you never would have guessed it was made in 1983 . tsui hark 's use of special effects was very creative and inventive . ( he continued doing this in the chinese ghost story trilogy and later productions . ) even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre . `` legend of zu '' is connected to `` zu '' warriors from magic mountain '' ! it is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one . the plot is a bit hard to follow . but to be honest it does n't matter . it is all about the action and adventure ! i always was wondering what tsui hark would do if he got his hands on cgi . now we know , he made this movie . maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that i am not going to be critical about that . there is so much happening on the screen , you simply wo n't believe ! i think it is a big shame that this movie was n't shown in theaters here in holland . because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas ! this movie easily can beat big budget hollywood productions like `` superman returns '' or xmen 3 . the only thing i do have to mention is the lack of humor ! in most of tsui harks 's movies he combines drama , fantasy , martial arts and humor . somehow it is missing in this movie . again i am not going to be picky about these small matters . `` legend of zu '' delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see . a true classic !
going into see seven pounds i was n't clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about . so within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot , have no idea what is going on and you think tim , who claims to be ben , is just a big asshole . all of this comes to an end when the `` twist '' , so to speak , is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie . basically tim ( will smith ) was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives . by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to . the acting of this film is great , as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress . rosario dawson , to me , this is one of her better movies , aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to . she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film . other actors , such as woody harrelson , have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character . although the casting of the film was still good . this movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped . the movie , however , was still pretty good . nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place . up until then it just seems like a pointless love story . final thought seven pounds=seven stars .
undoubtedly one of the great john ford 's masterpieces , young mr. lincoln went practically unnoticed at the time of its initial release , no wonder because the year was 1939 when many of the greatest movies of the whole cinema history had been released , including the most mythical western in the history of the genre , john ford 's milestone stagecoach and many others , such as gone with the wind , the wizard of oz , mr. smith goes to washington which took the oscar in the only category young mr. lincoln was nominated for , which is original screenplay . it continued to be the most underrated ford 's film for many years ahead destined to gradually fade away in the shadow of other john ford 's masterpieces , but by the end of the 1950s american and european film critics and historians took a hold of a note written by legendary russian director sergei eisenstein about the young mr. lincoln where he praised it and acknowledged that if he would only have had an opportunity to direct any american film ever made till then , it would be definitely john ford 's young mr. lincoln . impressed by such an undoubted preference from eisenstein , critics began to see the film again but only with a bit different eyes and film 's reputation has been increasing ever since . it was far not for the first time the life of one of the most legendary american presidents was brought to the screen . right in the beginning of the 1930s griffith did it in his abraham lincoln and the same year as ford 's film , mgm released john cromwell 's one called abe lincoln in illinois . curiously enough both of them were based on a very successful broadway stage play released in 1938 and written by robert sherwood . as far as john ford 's films are concerned , we can easily find many references to the life and deeds and even death of mythical lincoln 's figure in several of director 's works , such as 1924 the iron horse or 1936 the prisoner of the shark island , the second one , just as young mr. lincoln , utilizes as the main musical theme the favourite lincoln 's song - dixie . the screenplay based on a previously mentioned stage play and lincoln 's biographies was written by lamar trotti in collaboration with john ford himself , which was quite a rare thing for ford to do but final result was simply superb - a script combining elements of the play with several historical facts as well as myths and legends about the beginning of abraham lincoln 's life and law practice culminating in a hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene , which is the film 's highest point and main laugh and tears generator , where lincoln defends the two young brothers accused of a murder and have to devise a manner to help their mother too when she is brought before the court as a witness and where the prosecuting attorney ( played by donald meek ) demands her to indicate which one of her sons actually committed the murder obviously obliging her to the making of an impossible choice of condemning to death one and letting live the other . overall it 's a very touching , heart-warming and even funny film with simply magnificent performance from henry fonda in his supreme characterization of abraham lincoln and with overwhelming richness of other characters no matter how little or how big they are incarnated from the wonderful and intelligent screenplay and conducted by the ability of john ford 's genius at one of its best deliveries ever . a definite must see for everyone . 10/10
a thin story with many fine shots . eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the d.r.e.a.m . team . and , to a lesser extent , the guy accompanying them . traci lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business-couple intending to poison the world with antrax . original in this movie is the bra-bomb , put on a captured member of the d.r.e.a.m.-team . of course she is rescued by a co-member , three seconds before explosion . although clearly lent from james bond 's 'goldfinger ' and 'you only live twice ' , such a climax always works well . all in all a nice watch , james bond replaced here by three charlie 's angels .
watching `` the fox and the child '' was an intoxicating experience . the lush visuals , integrity of point of view , and utter beauty of the setting and characters left me in a swoon of pleasure . the plot is uncomplicated . deceptively simple . within the container of that simplicity a world unfolds that draws you in and leaves you breathless . i laughed . i wept . i learned . this is a movie you can trust yourself to -- give yourself over to . dare i say it is an act of love intended for any innocent heart . it reaches to the heart of the viewer -- of any age -- and reveals the world through new eyes , as if seen from the heart . adi da samraj once said that true art draws the viewer beyond point of view into ecstatic participation in reality . i feel i have been privileged to watch -- no , to participate in -- this film , a work of true art .
i first saw this mini-series a number of years ago on british television and was immediately captivated by the story . this rather surprised me as i am not a great fan of either 'jane eyre ' or 'wuthering heights ' ; i consider the heroine of the former to be a self-righteous bore , and the latter piece of work as overblown claptrap . 'the tenant of wildfell hall ' , like the aforementioned works , is also somewhat depressing in parts . however , the darker parts of the film were offset by the excitement of helen 's escape , the breathtakingly wild and beautiful landscape of yorkshire , and the sexual magnetism of toby stephens . this film successfully portrays the frustratingly restrictive lifestyle of all women of the time . at best they suffered from a form of minor domestic tyranny as portrayed by the treatment of the womenfolk in the markham household . at the other end of the scale , there is the unfortunate helen who is married to a wealthy man of high estate , but is exposed to brutality and humiliation alternating with long periods of neglect . she runs away and experiences a brief moment of freedom but , as a women of mystery living alone in a rural community , she inevitably becomes the subject of spiteful gossip and speculation . tara fitzgerald is excellent as the long-suffering helen markham . not only incredibly beautiful ( in spite of that terribly unflattering hairstyle ) with the most amazing cheekbones , she is also more than capable of playing the central role in the film . tara is dignified and aloof while , at the same time , allowing us to see that helen is still dangerously vulnerable . rupert graves is the depraved , yet curiously attractive arthur huntingdon - after seeing him , i could never imagine another actor playing that part . pam ferris deserves special mention for her role as gilbert 's indulgent mother , as does the actress who played his sister rose , and simon carter who is the uncharitable vicar with a taste for the good things in life . finally , i could watch this film for toby stephens alone ; he is so good-looking , rugged , sexy , sensitive ( but not in a nauseatingly sentimental way ) . i am not even sure if he is a good actor as my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively ! if there is a fault with the film it is the use of flashbacks which i felt both interfered with the flow of the story and made it slightly confusing . other people , who have watched this film with me , also had problems with this , and i found i had to explain to them that certain scenes were in fact retrospective . i am extremely grateful for the people responsible for making this film . not only did i puchase the video ( a rare occurrence ) , but it led me to buy anne bronte 's superb novel . naturally , this was better than the film , but only by a narrow margin . i recommend that anyone interested should watch the film and then read the book in that order .
i was also on hand for the premiere in toronto . this film was sort of a consolation when i thought i would n't be able to get in to see my first choice . well , i was totally blown away . by the time i got to the theater i could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie ( yes , i actually forgot who was even in it . ) terrific performances from the entire cast . carrie-anne moss was great in a true departure from her days as trinity . as for billy connolly , i think not since chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever . the kids were also great . definitely check this one out if you get the chance . and , by the way , i got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better .
yes it may be goofy and may not seem as funny as many high budget comedies out there , but this movie is truly hilarious if you really watch it . tim meadows has always struck me as being funny off of the saturday night live show . whenever he would do this character on the show i would crack up laughing . so after i saw this was going to be playing on comedy central one night i decided to check it out . all in all i was farily impressed with this movie , because it was n't meant to win any oscars or become comedy of the year , but it did entertain the saturday night live fans that love the ladies man character . this movie is also packed with some highly quotable lines that can be recited for years to come .
definitely one of the lesser of the astaire/rogers musicals . it 's just very poorly plotted and paced . it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time , for example , but it feels a heck of a lot longer . this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet hilliard . scott is rarely ever interesting . i like hilliard . she 's sweet , and i love at least one of her songs , `` but where are you ? '' ( `` get thee behind me satan '' , her other number , is a weak leftover from top hat , thankfully cut from that masterpiece ) . follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers . the dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers . the dance is just fantastic . `` i 'm putting all my eggs in one basket '' presents the two rehearsing a dance that they do n't quite have perfected yet . its imperfections make it all the more perfect . and `` let 's face the music and dance '' is easily one of irving berlin 's best songs . so the film is well worth watching for its great moments .
this is the best movie i ` ve ever seen ! ! ! thomas beckett & richard miller -two mankinds who want to survive in the `` jungle '' of violence and madnes , one shot - one killed ! ! ? you must kill , if you getting doubt about something , you must survive ! ! p.p.- i appologise of my bad / worst/ english ! ! !
i actually did n't start watching the show until it came on fx . i was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the show 's reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it . i was so upset that i had not watched the show when it first aired on t.v . i loved the show so much ! finally a show for everyone to enjoy . i remember full house and family matters and step by step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough . they would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid , but not that 70s show . that 70s show was hilarious , smart and so real . i think it was the best show ever made and i 'm very sorry that it ended . although i love this show , i do think it should have ended on the seventh season when eric and kelso leave . the last season was just not right , eric was the main character and the show should have ended when his character leaves . i still love this show and i hope tv starts making more shows like this one .
most stoogephiles consider this to be the best stooges short bar none , and they 're right . curly is a scream dressed up in drag as `` senorita cucaracha '' , and moe and larry are in top form as `` senor mucho '' and `` senor gusto '' , respectively . christine mcintyre 's beautiful operatic voice is given full rein -- she actually was a trained opera singer -- and it 's wonderful . the great gino corrado is hilarious as a pompous italian singer terrorized by the stooges at a society party . some truly funny gags , good direction and very tight editing make this rise to the very top of the stooges ' prolific output . what 's even more amazing is that curly was having severe health problems at the time , and in several of the shorts he made during this period , you can see that he is obviously ill ; his timing is way off , he speaks very slowly and haltingly , and has trouble getting around . fortunately , his health was in an upswing when he made this film , and it shows . classic stooge comedy , and enjoyed by even non-stooge fans ( i had a girlfriend who could n't stand the stooges , but even she laughed at this one ) . a must-see .
there is no doubt that halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also outside.i love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about.also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do.this is a movie that i enjoy watching highly , especially around halloween time.john carpenter is a very professional directer i love a lot of his other films , but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film halloween.oh and if your thinking about watching the rob zombie remake don't.it is pure crap and a true halloween fan would like the 1978 john carpenter version better.michael myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film , and is a very well known one.so by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it .
some people loved `` the aristocrats '' and others hated it , frequently walking out in the middle . reactions to eddie izzard are n't likely to be that extreme -- if you can handle a transvestite comedian ( who says he likes girls ) and has a vocabulary that makes , shall we say , enough use of the `` f '' word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television . many of izzard 's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances . on the other hand , i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzard 's chest but also more often than not funny and , in spots , absolutely hilarious . he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines . he 's not a story teller . he 's not a joke maker . he 's not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams . he plays around with ideas , some of which work and some of which -- a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz , for instance -- are completely unfunny . he has a way , however , of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect . i gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8 . but a 10 ? no way .
if the very thought of arthur askey twists your guts , do n't worry , you can still watch and love the ghost train , like the equally marvellous back room boy , it is a film that is simply too damn good to be sunk by a single performance , even that of the lead actor . personally , i love askey , perhaps it 's because i go into his world , rather than unreasonably expecting him to come into mine , which is a mistake too many people make . the ghost train is so intensely atmospheric that you could n't conceivably watch it without being amazed at the deep , dark world it transports you to , it is immersive in a way that few cheap and cheerful flag-wavers managed to be during the desperate early '40s and it 's a film that i would imagine few people have ever watched just the once . the cast are , without exception , extraordinarily good , perhaps linden travers lays it on a bit thick , but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime , she could hardly play a nutter and not stand out . the sad passing of the lovely carole lynne earlier this year broke the last link we had with this incredible film and now it really is in the past , but waiting patiently for us to press play .
i first saw this as a child living in east london . the scars of hitlers luftwaffe were all too evident and the landscape of the movie was reminiscent of our street . i remember having nightmares after seeing it . the odd thing is , it really has n't dated if viewed as a piece of social history in cinema fiction . apart from a globally destructive war , the scale of the machines was badly awry , more nano-technology now , but overall , an excellent and well-crafted work . it was interesting to see how space travel was perceived back then . i would think that firing a spacecraft from a gigantic gun would almost certainly kill the astronauts . however , much was right . mans desire for war , mans inhumanity to man . the means of war as a catalyst for development .
young beautiful eva ( hedy lamarr ) marries an older man ( zvonimir rogoz ) . unfortunately he ca n't satisfy her sexually and ignores her . frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce . then , one day , she 's skinny dipping in a lake in the middle of the woods . her horse gallops off with her clothes ... and she runs after it ! she meets young and very handsome adam ( aribert mog ) . they make love and she realizes this is the man she wants . ending spoiler ! ! ! ! naturally , since this was made in 1933 , she has to be punished for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale . end of ending spoiler ! ! ! ! this horrified people in 1933 but it 's pretty tame by today 's standards . lamarr 's nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude , it 's either shown in extreme long shot or is covered by branches and such . there 's only a few minor shots of her breasts . also when she has sex with mog , nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an orgasm . these scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the american release . now today they 're back in . this film would get by with a pg-13 easily now . shock episodes aside this is just ok . it is beautifully filmed and there 's next to no dialogue . except for the music score this could be a silent picture . luckily all the actors are good -- lamarr and mog especially and they 're so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them . also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences i 've ever seen in a movie . the scenes with the sexual symbolism ( there 's quite a few of them ) are unfortunately pretty obvious today . i actually started to giggle during one ! so , great direction , beautiful imagery , attractive actors , good acting all around -- but i was n't exactly bowled over by it . i found the movie slow-moving ( beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me ) , somewhat dull , obvious , static and had a negative ending . i can live with the ending but it does n't excuse the other problems i had with it . also the final sequence is really strange -- and out of place . so i admire this film more than anything else . it was well-done and i 'd recommend it but with caution . many people seem to love this movie so i 'm in the minority . use your own judgment .
this is a extremely well-made film . the acting , script and camera-work are all first-rate . the music is good , too , though it is mostly early in the film , when things are still relatively cheery . there are no really superstars in the cast , though several faces will be familiar . the entire cast does an excellent job with the script . but it is hard to watch , because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented . it is now fashionable to blame the british for setting hindus and muslims against each other , and then cruelly separating them into two countries . there is some merit in this view , but it 's also true that no one forced hindus and muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition . it seems more likely that the british simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends . the result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen . but it is never painted as a black-and-white case . there is baseness and nobility on both sides , and also the hope for change in the younger generation . there is redemption of a sort , in the end , when puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life , but also truly loved her , and her family which has disowned her , then later come looking for her . but by that point , she has no option that is without great pain for her . this film carries the message that both muslims and hindus have their grave faults , and also that both can be dignified and caring people . the reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching , since there can never be real reconciliation across the india/pakistan border . in that sense , it is similar to `` mr & mrs iyer '' . in the end , we were glad to have seen the film , even though the resolution was heartbreaking . if the uk and us could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness , they would certainly be better off .
this western is done in a different manner than most others . realism is the key here . conchata farrell comes to wyoming to work for rip torn on his ranch . how this is presented makes for a most interesting slice of americana . i would have preferred to see this on the big screen rather than on tape , but it 's worth a look to see just how life was back in the real west . cinematography is excellent . solid 9 . torn & farrell excel in this movie .
since the day i saw this film when it came out in 1981 , it has been one of my top 3 favorites . the blurb i wrote for amazon is below , and i 'm just thrilled that it 's finally coming out on dvd on 10/17/06 - the film 's 25th anniversary . the last credit in this film explains its appeal - `` thank you to the people of manhattan on whose island this was filmed . '' a charming and witty romantic comedy , it is a love story written to new yorkers ( peter bogdanovich is a native ) who can identify every location ( west 12th street , the ansonia , the old fao schwartz , the plaza , the roxy , chez brigitte , and city limits which was a country & western club ) . one gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on , and this intimacy is clearly communicated . i laughed , i cried , it was better than cats . not only an ode to dorothy stratten , it was also audrey hepburn 's last feature appearance ( she had a cameo subsequent to this film ) and her inner beauty seeps from the screen . buy it , make a big tub of popcorn , and curl up with someone you love .
greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman , nina foch , ( julia ross ) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work . julia reads an ad in the local london newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position . julia obtains the position and is hired by a mrs. hughes , ( dame may witty ) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job . george macready , ( ralph hughes ) is the son of mrs. hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives . this was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery . this strange family all live in a huge mansion off the cornwall coast of england and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense .
peter o'toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor . the lovely susannah york provides a good foil for o'toole 's dramatic presence . the film alludes to incest -- without a single explicit scene -- but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary . though this is not major film by any reckoning , it will be remembered for its entertaining performances . even york , signing the papers at the end , is a treat to watch , exuding tragedy silently . the possible weakness here is thompson 's laid-back direction . but the film floats because of the actors and the script . i saw the film twice over a period of 20 years -- on both occasions with the name `` brotherly love '' . `` country dance '' is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie , wherever it was released as such .
by dane youssef `` coonskin '' is film , by the one and only ralph bakshi , is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes , as well as a look at life black in modern america ( modern for the day , i mean -- 1975 ) . paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame . but this is a bakshi film , controversial , thrilling , and a must-see almost by definition alone . not just another random `` shock-jock '' of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock . it 's by ralph bakshi . anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie , he has something big to say ... although it 's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation , `` coonskin '' is n't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick . `` coonskin '' wants to be more . it aims it 's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish . the movie does n't just poke fun at the genre . nor does it just indict black people , but actually seems to show love , beauty and heart in the strangest places . `` coonskin '' tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break . the fact that it 's even possible to break out of a prison in the `` coonskin '' world alone makes it old-fashioned . one of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in harlem named brother bear , brother rabbit , preacher fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary . the itallian mob is running all the real action . big name black musicians star : barry white and scatman crothers , as well as charles gordone , the first black playwright to take home the pulitzer . something big is happening here obviously . the movie plays out like a descent into this world , this side of the racial divide . from an angry , hip , deep , soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand . bakshi 's films never know the meaning of the word `` sublety . '' this one looks like it 's never even heard of the word . but maybe a subject like this needs extremism . real sledgehammer satire . some subjects ca n't be tackled gently . bakshi is god-dammed merciless . here , no member or minority of the harlem scene appears unscathed . the characters here are `` animated '' to `` real '' all depending on what the mood and situation are . the animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally . bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value . he always has something to say . nor is black-face is gratuitously . here , unlike in spike lee 's `` bamboozled , '' he seems to be using it to try and really say something . like 99.9 % of all of bakshi 's films , this one incorporates animation and live-action . usually at the same time . bakshki is n't just being gimmicky here . all of this technique is all intertwined , meshing together while saying something . somehow , this one feels inevitably dated . many of these types of films ( bakshi 's included ) are very topical , very spur of the moment . they reflect the certain trend for the day , but looking back of them years later , there 's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia ( as well as timeless truth ) . even though the music , clothes , slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule , the attitude , the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f -- king ear it is . anyone who 's really seen the movies , the state of things and has been in company of the people know what i 'm talking about . even some of the of the black characters are a bunny ( junglebunny ) , a big ol ' bear and a fox . one of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty harlem cop who 's hot on the trail of these `` dirty n -- -- -s '' after the death of a cop . but for him , it 's not just business . nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield . it 's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks . the sequence involving the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film , of which there are many . it plays out like an opera or a ballet . the promo line : warning : `` this film offends everybody ! '' this is not just hype . proceed with extreme caution . you have been warned ... by dane youssef
bruce almighty , one of carrey 's best pictures since ... well ... a long time . it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too ... morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny . it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes . the best scene in , it is where jim is messing up the anchor man 's voice . my rating : 8/10
an excellent example of `` cowboy noir '' , as it 's been called , in which unemployed michael ( nicolas cage ) loses out on a job because he insists on being honest ( he 's got a bum leg ) . with really nothing else he can do , he decides that for once he 's going to lie . when he walks into a bar , and the owner wayne ( the late , great j.t . walsh ) mistakes him for a hit-man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne ( lara flynn boyle in fine form ) , michael plays along and accepts waynes ' money . * then * he goes to suzanne and informs her of her husbands ' intentions , and accepts * her * money to get rid of wayne ! if that did n't complicate things enough , the real hit-man , `` lyle from dallas '' ( dennis hopper , in a perfect role for him ) shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before . `` red rock west '' gets a lot out of the locations . director john dahl , who co-wrote the script with his brother rick , was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes . it 's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation . it 's an appreciably dark and twist-laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt , have at least been morally compromised like michael . the lighting by cinematographer marc reshovsky is superb in its moodiness ; even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing . even if the writing is n't particularly `` logical or credible '' , the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in . cage does a good job in the lead , but his co-stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their meaty and greed-motivated characters . hopper , boyle , and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts . timothy carhart and dan shor are fine as walshs ' deputies ( in one especially good twist , walsh is also the local sheriff ) , and there 's an entertaining cameo role for country & western star dwight yoakam , who also graces the film with an enjoyable end credits tune . it 's quite a good little film worth checking out . it moves forward at an impressive pace , and if nothing else is certainly never boring . 8/10
`` my child , my sister , dream how sweet all things would seem were we in that kind land to live together , and there love slow and long , there love and die among those scenes that image you , that sumptuous weather . '' charles baudelaire based on the novel by elizabeth von arnim , `` enachanted april '' can be described in one sentence  it takes place in the early 1920s when four london women , four strangers decide to rent a castle in italy for the month of april . it is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that `` enchanted april '' - an ultimate `` feel good '' movie is perfection of its genre . lovely and sunny , tender and peaceful , kind and magical , it is like a ray of sun on your face during springtime when you want to close your eyes and smile and stop this moment of serene happiness and cherish it forever . this is the movie that actually affected my life . i watched it during the difficult times when i was lost , unhappy and very lonely , when i had to deal with the sad and tragic events and to come to terms with some unflattering truth about myself . it helped me to regain my optimism and hope that anything could be changed and anything is possible . i had promised to myself then that no matter what , i would pull myself out of misery and self-pity and i would appreciate every minute of life - with its joy and its sadness ... i promised myself that i would go to italy and later that year i did and i was not alone . charming , enchanting , and heartwarming , `` enchanted april '' is one of the best movies ever made and my eternal love . this little film is a diamond of highest quality .
i really like this film ... when i started to watch it i thought i would get bored pretty soon , but it surprised me ... i thought it was a great film and have seen it a few times now . the characters are believable and i have to say that i fell in love with brian austin green all over again ( the first time being beverly hills 90210 ) . i would recommend this film if you are a fan of his , but i do agree with another comment made earlier , that the ending is sort of disappointing . i would have loved it to turn out a little different ! never mind though , good gripping story .
gino costa ( massimo girotti ) is a young and handsome drifter who arrives in a road bar . he meets the young , beautiful and unsatisfied wife giovanna bragana ( clara calamai ) and her old and fat husband giuseppe bragana ( juan de landa ) , owners of the bar . he trades his mechanical skills by some food and lodging , and has an affair with giovanna . they both decide to kill giuseppe , forging a car accident . the relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police . this masterpiece ends in a tragic way . the noir and neo-realistic movie of luchino visconti is outstanding . this is the first time that i watch this version of ` the postman always rings twice ' . i loved the 1946 version with lana turner , and the 1981 version , where jack nicholson and jessica lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the cinema , but this one is certainly the best . my vote is ten .
honestly , i find this film almost too depressing for my own good . it is very depressing until pretty much the very end . there is no way i can justify passing judgement to any character who did things i did n't like ( well , except for the disgusting character played by fredrick forrest ) . but it 's still so frustrating to see people behaving this way , putting up walls around themselves when just a word or so could break the ice and promote healing . a horrible tragedy strikes a montana family . they believe they 've lost one son , but it turns out they 've lost 2 . the key is , if they just communicate and face their grief together , they wo n't end up losing their second son permanently . but they just ca n't . something is blocking this family from sharing their sorrows . some family retreat into silence and resentment while certain others point fingers of blame ( and then go ahead and cheat on their poor pregnant wife by seducing the pretty girlfriend of the deceased ... that andy character truly is a snake ! ) the only member of the family that is n't threatening arnold in some way is his grandpa ( wilford brimley ) . grandpa seems to be able to speak to the boy without judgements or even kid gloves . he seems to know what the child is thinking about even though arnold is n't saying much these days . it is truly a blessing for the poor kid to have that one someone he can turn to . no one else seems to grasp the fact that arnold might be in shock , in denial , or that his way of grieving may not be the same style , or at the same speed , as they would expect . it 's so easy to judge and to be angry and to feel someone is `` made of stone '' just because they do n't grieve in a way we believe they ought . the story is very quiet and naturalistic . you 're not going to get some spoon-fed narration or some hollywood feel-good resolution . i was very concerned by the fact that this child was so burdened with guilt that he felt it necessary to hitchhike several hundred miles to apologize to that piggy andy 's wife , for something he should not blame himself for . arnold may have accidentally killed his brother , but nobody is responsible for the end of that marriage , which apparently was a lousy one anyway , except for the two people in the marriage . it 's only dumb luck arnold did n't get into the car with a pedophile or a murderer . robert duvall and glenn close are frustratingly effective as the parents who somehow can not find it in themselves to communicate with their son , to find out what arnold is going through . jason presson , whom i 've not seen anywhere else except for a childhood favorite called explorers and a creepy ghost story called the lady in white , did an incredible job as arnold , a great performance from a child actor . aside from being somewhat slow at times , the stone boy is an excellent , and very depressing movie .
so , not being a poet myself , i have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary . the effortless motion of goldsworthy , as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating . watch him stick reeds together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work , and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot . be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze knocks down the entire web . the genius of goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself . it is in the essential change of nature where his work , though complete in its own sphere , is made whole .
though structured totally different from the book by tim krabbé who wrote the original 'the vanishing ' ( spoorloos ) it does have the same overall feel , except for that koolhoven 's style is less business-like and more lyric . the beginning is great , the middle is fine , but the sting is in the end . a surprise emotional ending . as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film , but it is done all very beautifully . never explicit , but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour . it is a shame american films ca n't be as open an honoust as this one . where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject , 'de grot ' stays always within the boundaries of good taste . 'de grot ' tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years . when you 'll leave the cinema you 'll be moved . what can we ask more of a film ? anyway , this film even gives more ....
this movie displays the kind of ensemble work one wishes for in every film . barbara bain and donald sutherland ( who play husband and wife ) are positive chilling , discussing the `` family business '' as if it were a grocery store or a dry cleaners . macy , campbell , ullman , and ritter are also terrific . they play off each other like members of a top-notch theatrical troupe , who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support the others unselfishly . and finally , there 's sammy ( david dorfman ) . what an amazing performance from a child ... and what an uncanny resemblance he has to ullman , whose son he plays ! we 're treated to a unique story in `` panic , '' and that 's a rarity in these days of tired formulaic crap . the dialogue is sharp and smart , and this relatively short film nevertheless has the power to elicit a full range of emotions from the viewer . there are places to laugh , to be shocked , to be horrified , to be saddened , to be aroused , to be angry , and to love . it 's not a movie that leaves you jumping for joy , but when it 's over you 're more than satisfied knowing you 've spent the last ninety minutes experiencing a darn good piece of work . more of us would go to theatres if we were treated to quality fare like this . when are the powers that be in hollywood going to wake up ? it 's a real shame when something this good fails to get exposure beyond festivals and households fortunate enough to have cable .
the movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred melissa joan hart and daniel baldwin . the main protagonist/antagonist jennifer stanton ( hart ) is a typical all american teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father ( baldwin ) . however , when she meets an ex con called nick ryan ( jeremy jordan `` never been kissed '' ) they instantly 'fall ' for each other , but jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship . she manipulates him to kill her parents , to protect their 'love ' but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with brad ( david lascher future 'sabrina ' cast mate for hart ) . melissa joan hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and nick so she can literally get away with murder . the rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time . i also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year , hart , began portrayed sabrina , the teenage witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television . although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to 'nine dead ' that comes out in november because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called `` clarissa darling `` or sabrina spellman '' i recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of melissa joan hart or sabrina . you can watch this on the internet , so i suggest check it out .
frankly , this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors . the opposite of perdition ( being lost ) is salvation ( being saved ) and this movie is one of a very few to deal with those two concepts . the movie also explores the love and disappointments that attend the father-son relationship . it should be noted at the outset that none of these are currently fashionable themes . the premise is that the fathers in the move , hit-man michael sullivan ( tom hanks ) and his crime boss john rooney ( paul newman ) , love their sons and will do anything to protect them . but rooney 's son connor is even more evil than the rest . he kills one of rooney 's loyal soldiers to cover up his own stealing from his father . when connor learns that sullivan 's son michael witnessed it , he mistakenly kills sullivan 's other son ( and sullivan 's wife ) in an attempt to silence witnesses . sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price , even at the terribly high price of perdition . rooney , who in one scene curses the day connor was born , refuses to give up his son connor to sullivan , and hires a contract killer named maguire ( jude law ) to kill sullivan and his son . so rooney joins his son connor on the road to perdition . for the rest of the movie , accompanied by his surviving son young michael , sullivan pursues connor rooney down the road to perdition , and maguire pursues sullivan . when sullivan confronts rooney in a church basement , and demands that he give up connor because connor murdered his family , rooney says - `` michael , there are only murderers in this room , .. , and there 's only one guarantee , none of us will see heaven . '' as the movie ends , somewhat predictably , one character is saved and one character repents . i 'm not a big tom hanks fan , but he does step out of character to play hit-man sullivan convincingly , giving a subtle and laconic performance . newman does well as the old irish gangster rooney , showing a hard edge in his face and manner , his eyes haunted by connor 's misdeeds . jude law plays maguire in a suitably creepy way . tyler hoechlin plays young michael naturally and without affectation . the cinematography constantly played light off from darkness , echoing the themes of salvation and perdition . the camera drew from a palette of greens and greys . the greys belonged to the fathers and the urban landscapes of depression era illinois . the greens belonged to the younger sons and that state 's rural flatlands . thomas newman 's lush , sonorous and haunting music had faint irish overtones and was played out in copland-like arrangements . the sets were authentic mid-western urban - factories , churches . the homes shone with gleaming woodwork . the excellence of the movie lies in its generation of a unique feeling out of its profound themes , distinctive acting , and enveloping music and cinematography . the only negative was a slight anti-gun message slipped into the screenplay y , the movie 's only nod to political correctness . i give this movie a10 out of 10 ; in time it will be acknowledged as a great film .
if you want to watch a movie and feel good about watching it , then tigerland is the film for you . i love this movie from top to bottom . this movie 's picture-perfect scenes look so real ; it 's almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life but with drama . boy , i tell you ... real drama they actually real `` fought '' in one of the scenes ( get the dvd listen to the commentary its not obvious ) . i see this film as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape an ill-fated destiny , after watching saving private ryan i have an a appreciation of what an `` ill-fated destiny '' is and know exactly how the men in the film feel . i see this movie as a crossbreed between `` stand by me '' and `` saving private ryan . '' what do men do when they are with a situation that 's `` hard pressed '' in real life ? some men go crazy , some men cry , some men through fists , others do drugs , some randomly sleep with hookers ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of love from their life , some try drink the pain away , some jump off buildings or bridges , some feel guilty and others feel so much agony it makes them so sick they collapse - physically . this movie has all those desperate emotions rolled into one ball . but do n't get me wrong its not depressing movie , its realistic , its a very very humorous movie , the cocky and funny bozz ( collin 's character ) lights it all up , and on top of that there are about 5 female actresses in the movie ; i 'll let you figure out what their in there for ! with dialogue , war/action sequences , picture perfect scenes along with appropriate music ; this movie has it all , like i said : from top to bottom . i do n't why tigerland is heavily under-credited . the best thing about owning the movie is that on the cover it says in big bold writing `` the best film of the year , '' and it absolutely falls nothing short of that . keep the rare gems coming hollywood , 10/10 .
i like my ronald colman dashing and debonair , the fellow you see in such films as if i were king and kismet . i like him as the epitome of civilization as in the lost horrizon and random harvest . a brooding colman is n't a favorite of mine . but in a double life precisely because his part as actor anthony john is so offbeat for him , colman was recognized with a best actor oscar for 1947 . it became his best known part . colman is an actor who really does take the method quite seriously . he 's just finished a successful run in a comedy of manners and he 's quite the jovial fellow . for a change of pace now that that play has concluded its broadway run , colman is bringing a revival of othello to new york . about as opposite a part as you can get . his leading lady in both is his former wife signe hasso who loves him dearly , but ca n't take his change of moods when he 's at work . colman loves her dearly as well and wants her back . but he 's heading for a mental breakdown when he starts confusing himself with the jealous moor othello and hasso with her role as desdemona . unfortunately shelley winters as a poor waitress who a depressed colman picks up gets in the way of his madness and she winds up like poor desdemona in the play . killed in the same manner and now it 's a matter for homicide cop joe sawyer . colman 's performance is so good that one does kind of wonder is this an occupational hazard with actors ? i 'd shudder to think so , were there any unsolved homicides in or around laurence olivier and orson welles then they essayed othello . i could never quite buy the story for that reason , but i certainly do applaud ronald colman and what he did with the part . i 'm sure there was a tinge of regret in him winning the oscar though because one of the other nominees was his good friend william powell for life with father . others in the running that year were gregory peck for gentlemen 's agreement , john garfield for body and soul , and michael redgrave for mourning becomes electra . colman gets able support from the rest of the cast including edmond o'brien who finds himself in the unwanted part of cassio in colman 's jealous fantasy . still you will find no iago equivalent in a double life , no one prodding the jealousy , it 's all in his own mind . and that from one of the most cultivated and civilized minds of the last century .
a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident . when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state , the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live . the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him . this comes to us from director rob schmidt , who made `` wrong turn '' ( a film i have not seen ) . with only one horror film under his belt , and not a particularly notorious one at that , i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode , expecting schmidt to be a `` master of horror '' in only the most liberal sense . my apologies to him for my underestimation . as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season , this was actually the best one yet . the issue of the `` right to die '' is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device . however , this is only the foundation on which the story revolves . once the horror elements show up , the film goes from `` decent '' to `` spectacular '' . great acting , great plot , great dialogue , great suspense . i was a little creeped out at times ( which is good ) and most of all : the gore is in extreme abundance ! i read a review of this episode prior to watching it , where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of `` hellraiser '' in this . through the first part of the show , i had no idea what they were talking about . then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of `` hellraiser 2 '' . however , i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film . i can see no other way to create the effect that was created , and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than `` hellraiser 2 '' . some plot twists show up later on , and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look . i did n't watch it a second time , but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had ( not that it 's confusing ) . the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice , and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him . he 's somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story , if you will . i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist , but he 's completely unlovable . while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i 'm excited about the `` washingtonians '' episode , i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine . when legends like john carpenter let me down ( again ) i get a bit worried about the genre 's future , but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope . this one is a keeper , and please bring schmidt back for season 3 !
i already loved `` how the grinch stole christmas '' when it was released and i 'm still loving it now , 5 years later . still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out . sure , the movie is over-the-top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch . all of the sets , costumes and characters are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way , without ever becoming truly ridicules . it 's a visually spectacular movie to watch . it 's a campy movie making at its very best ! director ron howard really surprises with this fun little christmas movie . main reason why the movie works and why it 's so much fun to watch is jim carrey as the grinch . he truly carries the movie with his good and fun role . he is of course helped by the convincing make-up , which also received an academy award . of course if you 're a jim carrey hater you should n't even think about watching this movie . this movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch . other fun and memorable roles are being played by jeffrey tambor , clint howard and josh ryan evans as the young grinch . the movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me . perhaps it 's because i 'm dutch and we do n't really celebrate christmas that enthusiastic and big here , as in the united states or england . for me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest . the musical score by james horner is good and fun , even though it 's your average every day horner stuff , it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene 's work . perfect christmas entertainment . 8/10
it 's a lovely movie , it deeply reflects the chinese underground bands ' current lives . if you chinese culture , traditionaled rock n roll music , there you go , i will highly recommend this one .but one thing i am wondering is whether this movie has been showed in mainland ? i sorta doubt it , :d
this was a fantastic episode . i saw a clip from it on youtube , and i vowed that should it ever show on tv , i would glue myself to the set in order to watch . i wound up watching it with a friend of mine , who happens to be gay , and the two of us cried at the end . this was a truly well-written , heartfelt episode of the forbidden love between two cops who , i felt , really were ( in coop 's words ) `` the lucky ones '' . it is episodes like this one that really make cold case one of the most captivating and much-loved works of television magic on cbs . i anxiously await more episodes , and a re-run of `` forever blue '' because i will always watch it again and again .
princess victoria ( emily blunt ) is in line for the throne of england . the present king william ( jim broadbent ) is not well and may not live long . however , vicky 's scheming mother , the duchess of kent ( miranda richandson ) and her aide , john ( mark strong ) want to force victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the `` regents '' until she is older , since she is only 20 years of age . the young lady refuses , despite john slapping her around . it is another sign that victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country . yet , when william does pass away , shortly after her 21st birthday , victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her . first , she must surround herself with the `` right '' advisers to govern wisely . she chooses handsome lord melbourne ( paul bettany ) who , although an older man , is mentioned as a suitor for vicky . which brings us to the young queen 's second major decision . sooner than not , the young queen should select her future mate , as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom , for an heir must appear in the coming years . meanwhile , in germany , some distant relatives of the british royal family are hatching some plans as well . handsome prince albert ( rupert friend ) , of the saxon-coburg dynasty , is prodded by his father to court the young english royal . once he arrives at the palace , he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual . but , since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making , can he succeed in winning her heart ? this is a lovely film , made even better by a completely winning performance by emily blunt as victoria . yes , she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily . friend , too , does well , as do the other actors , including broadbent , richardson , bettany , strong ( what a repulsive role ! ) , and the rest . also , the movie is gorgeously shot , costumed , and set , making it a visual treat in every way . if anything is lacking , it is an extra dose of dazzle , as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic , at times , with a somewhat unimaginative edit . however , this is only a minor , minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film . in short , young and old , should make time for young victoria . it is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings .
i just viewed the film two days ago , and i was filled with anticipation , being that paris is my second favorite city in europe and i spent a very romantic 18 months there in the '80 's . i was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes , while original and artistically done , did not capture the `` light '' and beauty of the city very well.nor enough of the romance ! we saw none of the tree-lined boulevards ... there was too much darkness , not only literally but figuratively . some of the plots manipulated the viewer it seemed , and let him/her down `` flat `` ( the marais sequence , the coiffure salesman sequence , to give two examples ) . the uplifting , good ones : the mime sequence , the cemetery , the montmartre ( though it left too much to the viewer to comprehend ) , the `` cowboy '' vignette , and the sacre coeur -- seemed few and far between , and i would have liked to have seen such a wonderful actor as orlando bloom be in something that would have showcased his originality more .
hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler ( jon voigt ) and his lame con-man sidekick ( dustin hoffman ) , soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skills . a daring film for its time , and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the '60s . symbolic of the `` end of innocence '' in american films , since it was the only x-rated film to win a best picture oscar . jon voigt is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body , but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk . befriended by a lame con-man ( dustin hoffman ) , he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter , ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in florida , a land his friend `` ratzo '' dreams of living in . but even in this final quest , the two are losers . john schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by waldo salt , and john barry 's haunting `` midnight cowboy '' theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation . summing up : a true american classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life .
an enjoyable game , which offers fun and easy game play and fair replay ability . staying true to the comic and providing a low learning curve gives this game something not seen in most action cartridges today . also , the narration and animated scenes used ( though lengthy animations are replaced by slide shows on the nintendo 64 version ) use full advantage of the platforms ' capabilities .
i know some people think the movie is boring but i disagree . it is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person . i liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of archie 's life a mystery captured his humanity . i do n't think the purpose of a good biography should be the detailing of someone 's life but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting . and what is more fascinating than someone so successfully reinventing themselves ? `` men become what they dream - you have dreamed well . '' good job to lord attenborough . i also wanted to mention that nathaniel arcand really stood out to me as a charismatic actor and i hope to see him in more films .
the best cheech & chong movie so far ! ! of all the cheech and chong this is most certain the best so far . i think i 've seen them all about twelve times at least , and i love them all . but this is most definitely the best . compared with the others this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of good laughs . part of the texts are still part of our language today , after 25 years . i hope that one day they can make another one , because they still are great comedians . i heard they are writing a new script so who knows ... i guess these guys are the only ones who succeeded in making decent movies in this genre . i wonder if john ashcroft ever watched one of them ...
i am of `` the christopher reeve generation '' it is fair to say that he was the best actor to play superman yet , but that does n't stop me from enjoying other actors in the role , and george reeves makes a pretty good bid to knock chris off the top , though he just barely falls short . that does n't stop me from enjoying this film , it has a lot going for it . it has all that a movie needs , a plot with beginning , middle , and end , plus all those parts are intelligently written . the film is edgy both in acting and storyline , something a film-noir but with tights . the story is both exciting and meaningful , this is a movie with a message that is n't too preachy . i am still amazed this was shot over 12 days , oh the glory days of hollywood , when we did n't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell ... the film is polished and expertly made , directed by lee `` roll'em '' sholem , best known for directing with both speed and efficiency . it never lets the constraints of technology slow it down , in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight , including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from superman 's point of view , also a few closeups of george in process work , and a long shot of an animated superman . this is now available on dvd as an extra feature on the first season of the george reeves television series . a dvd worth owning in its own right , the inclusion of the film as its original whole , is icing on the cake . give blood today god bless !
a very interesting entertainment , with the charm of the old movies . tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it , and we all enjoy with him his success.the most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills ( he was a great swimmer and had a great shout )
in don siegel 's 1971 masterpiece `` dirty harry '' , clint eastwood epitomized the super-tough , super-cool unorthodox , no-nonsense cinema-cop with his role of the eponymous inspector 'dirty ' harry callahan . two sequels followed , the first of which , `` magnum force '' , tamed down on the delightfully politically incorrect attitude of the first one that had outraged many critics but enthused audiences . the second sequel , `` the enforcer '' was grittier again , and was promoted as `` the dirtiest harry of them all '' . this title , however , truly belongs to the fourth film in the series , clint eastwood 's own `` sudden impact '' , which is doubtlessly the grittiest , nastiest , most violent and downright dirtiest of all harry films , and , in my humble opinion , the second-best after the masterpiece original . * * * warning ! spoilers ahead ! * * * in a small town near san francisco , a mysterious sexy lady ( sondra locke ) lures men into being alone with her . what these men do n't know is that mysterious beauty is their former rape victim , longing for bloody revenge . as fate wants it , san francisco 's toughest cop , inspector dirty harry callahan , who has been suspended once again for angering his superiors , spends his leisure time in this exact little town ... `` sudden impact '' is the dirtiest callahan film in several aspects . the film is extremely gritty and graphically violent . harry callahan himself is dirtier than ever . not afraid to make use of his 44 . magnum in order to stop trouble , harry treats 'punks ' as they are to be treated and even allows a person to get away with several murders because the revenge-murders are justified in his opinion . clint eastwood is , as always , brilliant in the role of harry callahan . eastwood epitomized coolness and bad-assery as the `` man with no name '' in sergio leone 's dollar trilogy , and he did so again in the dirty harry films . `` sudden impact '' gives us the dirtiest harry we have ever seen . eastwood 's real-life girlfriend sondra locke fits very well in the role of the vengeful beauty . the great pat hingle , who had already worked with eastwood in ted post 's tough-minded western `` hang 'em high '' in 1986 plays the police chief of the small town . the film furthermore includes a wide range of truly despicable scumbag characters , including a pathetic criminal played by kevin major howard ( best known for his role in stanley kubrick 's `` full metal jacket '' ) and a woman named ray perkins ( audrie j. neenan ) , doubtlessly one of the most disgusting and despicable female characters ever in cinema . albert popwell , who played the bank robber in the famous `` do you feel lucky ? '' scene in `` dirty harry '' and the black militant leader in `` the enforcer '' is also part of this one again , this time as harry 's colleague and buddy . overall `` sudden impact '' is the grittiest , dirtiest and probably the most violent of all `` dirty harry '' films , ( though `` the dead pool '' is n't exactly tame either ) , and my second-favorite after the brilliant 1971 original . an absolute must-see for callahan fans , and highly recommended to all lovers of police thrillers and cinematic bad-assery . my rating : 8.5/10
enterprise , the latest high budget spin-off to the most successful franchise in film and or television history opens to the tune of a 90-minute episode called 'broken bow ' . first we are swept into a massive action sequence with a klingon being chased by some suliban ( who are the main enemy in the first season of the show ) . from there the televised movie takes us on a journey that seldom gets as good as it is , with some of the best character development , story and action/visual effects ever seen in such a short amount of time . the opening-credits is a debatable subject among the minority of enterprise fans , whom some believe that the song is out of place . what they fail to realise is the lyrics themselves . if one listens to the actual song , instead of the theme , then they will begin to piece the parts of the puzzle together . and eventually as the series progresses further and further , and we learn more about our valiant captain and his crew , will the song actually become meaningful . overall diane warren 's theme is beautifully orchestrated and is sung just as well by opera singer russell watson . what makes any television show watchable and worth watching time and time again is its characters and the way they become structured and layered . enterprise is ( in my opinion ) one of the most well cast shows since the next generation . choosing scott bakula , as captain jonathan archer was the best decision since gene himself cast patrick stewart as jean-luc picard . as the captain always leads the show , bakula adds a subtlety to his role and brings a huge smile to the faces of anyone with blood pumping in their veins . he simply is ( both actor wise and character wise ) a superb human being and his charm , wit , and compassion are overwhelming to watch . as for the other cast members , a favourite of mine is john billingsley who plays dr. phlox . it 's also nice to see a non-human playing a role , and the decision to give the captain a dog , named 'porthos ' was a well-received idea . throughout the show character development was brilliant , it was fast , well timed and almost perfect . i say almost because sadly travis mayweather 's character played by the briton anthony montgomery is a little weak at the end of the first season . he does have some things to say here and there , but remains in the hands of the producers to make him more important . jolene blalock is wonderful as the sometimes harsh but equally loveable subcommander t'pol . dominic keating as lieutenant malcolm reed plays a strong role and is convincing as the armoury officer . connor trinneer plays commander charles `` trip '' tucker who always adds charm and comedic style to his character and finally linda park as ensign hoshi sato , who often plays a weaker character but thankfully quickly becomes interesting . all of these characters make up enterprise , and all bring a quality that star trek has n't seen in a long time . each person makes this show worth watching . smiles and feel-good senses are guaranteed right from the first time we see them all together on the bridge of the starship enterprise nx-01 . the ship itself , the nx-01 is somewhat questionable in design . the series is set 150 years from now and 100 years before captain kirk . so why then does the ship appear to be similar in design to mid 24th century ships , namely the akira class starship ? continuity has been an issue in enterprise , but thankfully rick [ berman ] and brannon [ braga ] offer suitable explanations for each and everyone of them . continuity is only a problem if you are forever scrutinising shows and are obsessed with the tiniest of details . if you see the show with and open mind , then you 'll have no problems , but there is an urge to know 'why ' all the time . so what did berman and braga offer to the star trek fan-base with the issue of the deign of the ship itself ? according to them the nx-01 is how it is because of the incident in first contact . when zefram cochrane saw the enterprise-e through his telescope and from speaking with the away team lead by commander riker , it changed the ideas in his head . that 's a good enough explanation for me.lets move on . of course its not as easy for some fans to accept that sort of answer , some go as far as to refuse to see the show until they get a reasonable answer . come on guys grow up.when george lucas destroyed the star wars saga with the launch of his profit making new trilogy , fans could n't do anything , only watch and sap it all up anyway . and then they learned that , well maybe its not that bad after all . if you ca n't accept a quality show for what it is , not what it should be in your mind , then go elsewhere . or try becoming a producer on the show and then see what you can do . the sets on enterprise remind me very much of the defiant from deep space nine . they often appear cold and have an eerie look of modern structure to them and they cry out that they belong to the military . perhaps that why the crew of the uss enterprise ( aka flagship of the american fleet ) like it so much . they are striking sets , and represent the show perfectly . rick berman 'the overlord of the empire ' as john logan so accurately put it and his counterpart brannon braga has hit the nail on the head exactly where they should have , and in all the right places . whether that be technicalities , visuals , sound , editing or score . enterprise is a fine demonstration to just how good televised science fiction can ultimately be , when in the hands of geniuses . the late gene roddenberry would be proud of this series and as a star trek fan , so should you .
he now has a name , an identity , some memories and a a lost girlfriend . all he wanted was to disappear , but still , they traced him and destroyed the world he hardly built . now he wants some explanation , and to get ride of the people how made him what he is . yeah , jason bourne is back , and this time , he 's here with a vengeance . ok , this movie does n't have the most elaborated script in the world , but its thematics are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society . of course , like every hollywoodian movie since the end of the 90 's , `` the bourne suprematy '' is a super-heroes story . jason bourne is a captain-america project-like , who 's gone completely wrong . in the first movie , the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second one . he now fights against what he considers like evil , after a person close to him has been killed ( his girlfriend in `` suprematy '' ) by them . that 's all a part of the super-hero story , including a character with ( realistic but still impressive : he almost invincible ) super powers . and the interesting point is that the evil he fights all across the world ( there 's no frontiers in the bourne 's movies , characters are going from one continent to another in the blink of an eye ) , is , as in the best seasons of `` 24 '' , an american enemy , who 's beliefs that he fight for the good of his country completely blinds him . funny how `` mad patriots '' are now the n.1 enemies of paranoiac hollywood 's stories . beside all those interesting thematics , the movie is n't flawless : the feminine character of nickie parson is for now on completely useless and the direction is quite unoriginal when it comes to dialogs scenes . but all that does n't really matter , for `` the bourne ultimatum '' is an action movie . and the action scenes are rather impressive . everyone here is talking about the `` waterloo scene '' and the `` tanger pursuit '' and everyone 's right . i particularly enjoyed the fight in tanger , that reminds my in its exaggeration and craziness the works of tsui hark . visually inventive scenes , lots of intelligent action parts and a good reflection on american 's contemporary thematics : `` the bourne ultimatum '' is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action flick .
just cause is a flawed but decent film held together by strong performances and some creative ( though exceedingly predictable ) writing . sean connery is an anti-death penalty crusader brought in to save a seemingly innocent young black man ( blair underwood ) from the ultimate penalty . to set things right , connery ventures to the scene of the crime , where he must contend not only with the passage of time , but a meddling sheriff ( laurence fishbourne ) . twists and turns and role reversals abound -- some surprising , some not -- as the aging crusader attempts to unravel the mystery . the climactic ending is a bit ludicrous , but just cause is worth a look on a slow night .
it is a great movie if you have ever named your cars or are really into old , fast , or exotic cars . it has a plot and a lot of action . the car scenes are great except for the totally fake car jump scene . all of the other scenes are great . i really enjoyed it and i hope everyone else does as well .
the young victoria is a beautiful film and has presented queen victoria in a different light to what everyone thinks about her . the films wipes away the `` i am not amused '' impression of queen victoria and shows she was a cheerful young woman . as i love history , particularly victorian history , you can imagine my reaction when i first saw this film advertised , i was so so so excited and counted down the days until it came to the cinemas . i was a little worried that it would n't be historically accurate , but it was and i loved it . i found out new facts about queen victoria that did n't know before and it interested me greatly . queen victoria in many lights was one of our all time greatest monarchs , and this film paints a picture of her real personality and what her life was like . she was treated so badly by her mothers adviser sir john conroy , because he wanted britain to have a regency . this was what inspired victoria to be a fantastic queen , which she was ! the romance between her and albert was so deep and this was very well done by emily blunt and rupert friend , who were both brilliant ! the young victoria is a heart felt love story but at the same time a great look into a major part of british history ... i love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 10/10 ... no doubt !
i actually quite enjoyed this show . even as a youngster i was interested in all sports and that included horse racing . it was always going to be difficult to make a series based on racing corruption and at the same time get permission from the race tracks to record filming about this controversial subject . one episode i particularly remember centred around a horse expected to win a big race that looked a bit off colour . a syringe was found on the stable floor and everyone thought it had been drugged but nothing showed up in the blood tests . all too late they realised the horse hadnt been doped but had had its knee cartilage removed . like running a car with no oil and the engine seizing up , the horse broke down with tragic consequences .
this movie has an all star cast , john candy , richard lewis , ornella mutti , cybill shepard , and jim belushi to name a few , run amuck in monte carlo , as well as some other beautiful european locations , and is very funny . the trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great , and i highly recommend that you see this movie , it is well worth it ! john candy is in top form in once upon a crime , as is everyone else ! if you and your family are looking for a great family film , this is your ticket . everyone gives stellar performances , great acting , great comedy , and great timing , which is rare in movies these days . great plot , great mystery , ( which i love anyways ) and overall , well worth the money you spend on it . so get the kids , grab some popcorn , juice , or tea , or sodas , and enjoy the show ! ! ! !
i must warn you , there are some spoilers in it . but to start it off , i got `` spanish judges '' on february i think . it was mention it was the last copy , but as i see , it was n't back-ordered . but either way , i have it . i thought it was good . i wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor , matthew lillard ( i 'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar ) although it is kind of low budget , getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending . man , what a good actor . the story it about a con artist known as jack ( matthew lillard ) who `` claims '' to have merchandises called the spanish judges . if you do n't know what spanish judges are or have n't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read , i wo n't even say what they are . i figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was . he needs protection , so he hires a couple who are also crooks , max and jamie ( vincent d'onofrio and valeria golino ) as well as a crook that goes by the name of piece ( mark boone junior ) . he has a girlfriend who wo n't even tell anyone her name because she 's from mars , as she said . so they ( mainly jack ) call her `` mars girl '' . everything starts out fine , but then it turns to one big game . a game that involves some lust , lies and betrayal . there was some over acting in it ( matt and valeria , as well as tamara , were not one of them ) . there were some scenes they could 've done better and the score could 've been a little better as well . some of the score was actually good . the theme they used for the beginning and the end ( before the credits ) was a good song choice , that 's my opinion . the fight scene in the end could 've been a little longer and a little more violent , but what can you do ? one more comment on matt : damn , he plays a smooth , slick con man . i know this is a review , but i need to make a correction towards necro , one of the reviewers : valeria golino is not a newcomer . according to this site , she has been acting since 1983 . to me , and hopefully to others , she is well known as charlie sheen 's italian love interest in both the `` hot shots ! '' movies . but good review . although i think it 's one of the rare films i 've seen and it 's really good ( which is why i gave it 10 stars above ) , i will give the grade of what i thought when i first saw it . 8/10
o my gosh ... just give me a minute to breath . this movie takes you on an awesome ride and does n't let you go until the very last blow in your face ending . this is the the movie for fans of stormriders and such . legend of zu was beautifully created , although i did n't like a few things , they used alot of stand ins . i wanted to see the real person fight but , oh well ... a few small let downs , and i did n't really like it a lot until i watched it again , when you understand it more it totally kicks a * * ! i encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true asian movie , to see this movie . i give this movie one of my highest ratings.go and see it when it comes out in america ! ! !
'the shop around the corner ( 1940 ) ' is a pleasant romantic comedy , not the sort that i will hold dear to me until the end of my days , but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation . by 1940 , director ernst lubitsch had long ago taken hollywood by storm , and his famed `` lubitsch touch '' had become a sparkling commercial trademark . this film was planned for a 1939 release , but scheduling conflicts meant that james stewart and margaret sullavan were unavailable for filming . rather than substituting either of his main stars , lubitsch decided to postpone production , in the meantime directing greta garbo in 'ninotchka ( 1939 ) . ' when it was finally completed , 'the shop around the corner ' appears to have been met with relative indifference , receiving zero oscar nominations despite an excellent screenplay by samson raphaelson and fine performances from its two leads and frank morgan in a supporting role . time , nevertheless , has betrayed the film 's massive and enduring influence , with high-profile remakes including 'in the good old summertime ( 1949 ) ' and 'you 've got mail ( 1998 ) . ' at its surface , one might assume 'the shop around the corner ' to simply be the story of two lovers , klara novak ( sullavan ) and alfred kralik ( stewart ) , who love each other without knowing it . however , lubitsch 's film runs much deeper than that . it 's the story of matuschek and company , a stylish gift shop in budapest , and the various human relationships that make the store such a close-knit family . when store-owner hugo matuschek ( frank morgan ) begins to suspect his oldest employee of having an affair with his wife , we witness the breakdown of two families , both at home and at work . there 's absolutely no reason why the story should not have been set in the united states  perhaps in the blustery streets of new york  but lubitsch was deliberately recreating the passions and memories of his former years in europe , the quaintness of love and life before war brought terror and bloodshed to every doorstep . this subtle subtext brings a more meaningful , personal touch to the film  in fact , even as i write this review , i 'm beginning to appreciate the story even more . sullavan and stewart are both lovely in their respective roles , but i think that it 's the supporting cast that really make the film . each character brings a distinctive personality to the mix , and their interactions are always believable and enjoyable . i especially liked how lubitsch knowingly directed much of our sympathy towards hugo matuschek , who , in any other film , would have been restricted to an underdeveloped , two-dimensional portrayal . matuschek may have lost the love of his family , but he recaptures it in the affection of his employees , and you feel a heartwarming glow when , in the bitter cold of a christmas eve snowstorm , he finds companionship in a freckle-faced young errand-boy ( charles smith ) . this genuine warmth towards a supporting character strikes me as being similar to several of billy wilder 's later creations , for example , boom boom jackson in 'the fortune cookie ( 1966 ) ' or carlo carlucci in 'avanti ! ( 1972 ) . ' of course , it does n't really need saying , but billy wilder learned from the best .
turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget . the variety of characters is amazing , from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls ! i enjoyed the relationship between the leads , not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going . i also enjoyed the mix of humour ( which can be very easy to get wrong , too much/not enough ) which meant it did n't get too dark , nor too spoofy . it was a great step up from eaves ' other efforts , hellbreeder and sanitarium , in terms of storyline and production . they have a great website which is worth checking out . ca n't wait for bane , if the level of improvement continues , it should be fantastic .
henry hathaway was daring , as well as enthusiastic , for his love of the people of the early days in us history . however , to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about brigham young and the mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film . in my opinion , hathaway did superb direction that conveys what a mormon people were in the early history of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of joseph smith to the date of film release . in often subtle filming and dialog delivery , he covered mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenes . i remember watching this movie on many saturday mornings during my youth in the early 1950 's . that was just over 10 years after the films release and before the los angeles temple was completed , which i watched being constructed and instilled more curious wonder of who mormons were . i recently purchased this film and will enjoy the following messages that hathaway interpreted in his film . 1 . love for all people , regardless of their personal beliefs , 2 . charity to those in need or not , 3 . family is high in importance , 4 . listen respectfully and carefully , because even opposing messages have important points to consider and adopt , 5 . work hard , both individually and in community , 6 . prepare and store for future days of need , 7 . hope is a binding link to a higher being , and for our daily lives , 8 . and , that there is a unique quality to any group , and appreciate those that are identified as beneficial .
will and ted 's bodacious journey is an existential trip through themes of mortality , religion , time , heaven and hell , man 's quest for fame and his fears of the body being overcome by a soulless machine . it is the most intelligent work of fiction since paradise lost and references many great past works of art- dante , iron maiden , virgil , shakespeare . this time the dudes are a famous rock band having travelled through time collecting icons from the past- napolean , joan of ark ( noah 's wife ) , oscar wilde , and charles darwin . they took the skills they learned from each of these people , abducted a couple of princesses , and finally learned to play their guitars and write hit songs . these songs teach the world to love again and war , hunger , evil are vanquished for eternity . we fast forward into the distant future where an evil dictator who despises good music called simon cow-al wants to rule the world . he eats rooshus ( the cool guy from the first film who helps bill playboy esquire and ted theodore alvin ) and gains the power to send two cyborgs back in time . the cyborgs are living tissue over metal exoskeleton and coated in mimetic poly alloy allowing them the survive the turmoil of time travel , and they can imitate anything they sample by physical contact . it is their job to kill the good biff and fred and take over their lives by making terrible music that no-one could like . by doing this they will change the world forever- gryll and jed 's music will never be made leaving a world of war , famine , and hatred , and more annoyingly , bland boy/girl group pop music . there is a startling twist as the good guys actually are killed and they have to work out a way to save the world , themselves , and their wives from the evil dopplebangers inhabiting their bodies . penelope spheerhead shows her knowledge of both youth culture and real culture by mixing modern day music and phrases with post modern sets and artistic references , and seeks to teach us all something by delving into our very psyche to show us ourselves . she presents the nightmares which faced the late 80s teen in a society which had abandoned them and beckons us to dissect the post structuralist jingoism , self love , and malaise of the time . charging us with a belief that we can indeed change the world it is an inspiring message , but in order to achieve such dreams we must traverse and indeed face our nightmares . to overcome is to succeed , to defeat death is the first step in truly living and not merely surviving . in the words of kenneth reeves- 'wow ! ' best scene : for a fun game- see how many songs , bands , and albums cover references you can spot throughout the film . there are at least 6 .
tony arzenta , a sicilian hit-man or professional killer , decides to leave the business , and his former employers do not agree.in terms of content , this highly enjoyable action movie does n't have one ; in terms of sheer amusement , it is funit is very melodramatic , violent , quite brutal , the car chases are notable . `` arzenta '' is an unpretentious , yet very likable filmmuch better than the current hollywoodian trash that gets the same label . it comes from delon 's rather short flirting with the italian b cinema of the '70s . it carefully uses delon 's tough guy persona , belonging to the gallery of bad-ass thugs that he made in his youth . i enjoyed very much the fact that delon made this film , that he had a role in a good eurocrime flick . the score is very fine , with a good introductory songmaking felt that gusto that the italians had for the film considered as a synthetic work , where the musical art has an important part . in tony arzenta/ big guns/ no way out the very appealing erika blanc ( 31 years in '73 ) appears as an unnamed hooker.meanwhile , arzenta 's girlfriend , sandra , is played by carla gravina ( a starlet that practically left the movies after '75 ) . `` arzenta '' is interestingly filmedan ambitious visual conception , some expressionistic peculiar angles . the movie was directed by the prolific duccio tessari , the one who made also zorro ( the delon comedy ) .needless to mention that these two films , tony arzenta ( 1973 ) and zorro , are very unlike.the first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie -- the second is a lighthearted comedy , more kindred to a spoof , though remarkably coherent and skilfully made.duccio tessari directed films like kiss kiss ... bang bang ( 1966 ) , sons of satan , the bloodstained butterfly , ¡viva la muerte ... tua ! , tough guys ( 1974 ) , safari express ( 1976 ) , etc ..
while this movie is n't a classic by any stretch , it is very entertaining as i remember it . i saw it about 15 years ago on hbo and loved the movie . it was written by the same guy that wrote and directed `` arthur '' and though it is n't as funny as that movie , it does show the potential that steve gordon reached with `` arthur '' .
i am extremely picky about the films i see . i 'd heard about moon child completely by accident . i 've been a fan of l'arc en ciel for some time and a fan of gackt and mizer only recently . i finally found out the film was being re-released and picked it up without a second thought . being as critical as i am about films , i will admit , the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times ... but they 're meant too be , as another user suggested , it 's the quintessential calm before the storm , quoting gary oldman from leon ... without getting into the spoilers , the film hit me extremely hard , because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say , true friendship is loyalty and like marriage , it 's until death do you part . hyde and gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics , their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into one 's soul and evoke response emotionally . upon seeing the film for the first time , i realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes . i want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current hollywood trend in film ... this takes an entirely new direction using classic yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from ryo ishibashi of takashi miike 's `` audition '' and `` suicide club '' fame ? man .. i just ca n't say enough about this film , but i 'll stop here . 10/10
king 's solomon 's mines brings us patrick swayze ( playing allan quatermain ) who has spent a lot of time in africa , but decides it is time to return to england and be a father to his son . he finds that his wife 's parents have taken custody of his son and that he has very little chance of getting custody of him with lots of money for a law suit . in comes alison deedy ( playing elizabeth ) whose father is in africa and being held by an african tribe for ransom of the map elizabeth 's father had sent her . elizabeth seeks out quatermain to take her back to africa to find her father . there is a good cast of supporting characters that go along with quatermain and elizabeth and of course there are some enemies ( russians ) who want the map also . the movie holds your attention until the end . patrick once again plays a ruggedly handsome honorable man who comes to the rescue of the damsel in distress . patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion , loss and despair , the rugged silent good man , anger and strength ; in king solomon 's minds his character actually smiles a few times . i would really like to see patrick swayze in a relaxed live-loving story again , one in which he does n't have to clench his jaws and be quite so strong . maybe a little dancing would help . but this is a good movie for the entire family and worth the time to watch it .
in `` anne of green gables '' ( 1934 ) , marilla cuthbert ( helen westley ) and matthew cuthbert ( o.p . heggie ) , middle-aged siblings who live together at green gables , a farm in avonlea , on prince edward island , decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm . but the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named anne shirley ( dawn evelyn paris-a veteran of disney 's series of `` alice '' shorts who later would adopt her character 's name ) . anne was only 11 in lucy maude montgomery 's source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story . the movie suffers somewhat from this concession , as many of anne 's reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven-year-old that from a teenager . as in the book , anne is bright and quick , eager to please but dissatisfied with her name , her build , her freckles , and her long red hair . being a child of imagination , however , anne takes much joy in life , and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of prince edward island . in fact anne is the original `` teenage drama queen '' and the film 's screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character . which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy . a change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists . since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the montgomery 's story i can see no reason to take issue with the changes , but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation . the comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest self-reflexive parodies of hollywood conventions . the actress anne shirley was one of hollywood 's all- time beauties and the film is in black and white . so much of the amusement is in seeing the title character 's endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen . anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like : `` if you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me '' . perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard . tom brown does a nice job as anne 's love interest gilbert blythe and sara haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the cuthbert 's pompous neighbor . then again , what do i know ? i 'm only a child .
here 's a rare gem for those of you that have n't seen or most likely not even heard of this . during the 80s , dennis quaid was a hot commodity , but in the early 90s , dennis quaid disappeared from the scene . in 1993 , he burst back onto the big screen with three movies , all of which unfortunately bombed . two of those films i liked very much , and let me elaborate on one of them . `` wilder napalm '' is a crazy flick about two brothers , wallace ( quaid ) and wilder ( arliss howard ) , whom are ... fire starters : yes they have the power of pyrokinetics . wilder has decided not to use his power anymore ( for anything not useful anyway ) after a fatal incident during his youth , where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house which killed a man who was inside unbeknownest to them . nowadays , wilder is a firefighter and is married to the wacky vida ( debra winger ) , who is under house arrest for , guess what , arson ( see the movie to understand this better ) . wilder also has n't spoken to wallace in 5 years , because wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor party . wallace loves his pyro power and uses it for amusement . he also runs a carnival and is the head clown . when the carnival comes to wilder 's town , wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see vida , whom which wallace has been in love with ! vida 's house arrest sees its end , but wilder is preoccupied . so , wallace steps in and the fun begins . brother vs. brother ... fighting fire with fire ! some great fireball throwing in this flick ... eat your heart out , drew barrymore ! the film also has some really weird , yet funny elements , like wilder 's fire unit sings songs acapella during firefights and after wards . jim varney ( globally known as 'ernest ' ) pops in as wallace 's redneck carnival buddy . `` wilder napalm '' is brilliantly shot ... and cleverly put together ... very off the wall and avant-guard . give this one a look ...
vertigo co-stars stewart ( in his last turn as a romantic lead ) and novak elevate this , stewart 's other `` christmas movie , '' movie to above mid-level entertainment . the chemistry between the two stars makes for a fairly moving experience and further revelation can be gleaned from the movie if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for the private pain that hampers many people 's relationships . all in all , a nice diversion with legendary stars , 7/10 .
i love this movie . i mean the story may not be the best , but the dancing most certainly makes up for it . you get to know a little bit about each character the way they want you to learn about them . i just think that you wo n't like this movie unless you 're into broadway ...
i grew up with h.r . pufnstuff and the dashingly talented jack wild and now my daughters are adoring fans of jack wild too . this movie is exactly what movies should be : fun and entertaining . this movie is not limited to children either . a lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and witchiepoo 's performance is something you do not want to miss . the music in this movie suited jack wild and mama cass beautifully . and as a jack wild fan , i would never miss the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing . knowing the hard life that jack had now makes this movie even more wonderful especially when he sings the opening song `` if i could '' . it makes me pause in loving adoration for him for giving me wonderful childhood memories that i am now passing on to my children . let 's all go to living island where there is friendship and fun ! and keep jack wild 's memory alive by passing pufnstuff on to others .
i saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show . i still vividly remember the film , especially the performance of robert taylor . i always thought taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid , almost dull leading man type , and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks . this film , however , proved what an interesting actor he could be . he did not get enough roles like this during his long career . this is his best performance . he is totally believable in a truly villainous role . from what i have read , he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles . he basically would just do what mgm gave him . this film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles . the other thing i remember about this film is how annoying lloyd nolan 's character was . nolan was a great actor , but this character really aggravated me . the last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years . this film is definitely worth a look .
thankfully saw this on a plane to singapore recently ( thought i 'd missed it at the cinemalaya filmfest ) . paris , je t'aime is a collection of 20 short films ( about 5 mins each ) by 20 directors showing love in various pockets of contemporary paris . one of my fave segments is 'parc monceau ' by alfonso cuarn ( great expectations , harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban ) , which was done in one continuous shot and features nick nolte . the coen brothers ' 'tuileries ' starring steve buscemi as a tourist in the metro was hilarious ! juliette binoche and willem dafoe in 'place des victoires ' was haunting . for maggie gyllenhaal as an american actress/druggie in 'quartier des enfants rouges ' to have portrayed anticipation and heartbreak in such a short period of time was just brilliant . elijah wood as a vampire victim in 'quartier de la madeleine ' was pretty surreal , while emily mortimer and rufus sewell played a cute couple in wes craven 's 'pre-lachaise ' . natalie portman was beautiful as usual as the actress girlfriend of a visually impaired french boy in 'faubourg saint-denis ' . but despite the many portrayals of young love , a more mature execution by gena rowlands in 'quartier latin ' was equally aww-inducing . this movie is perfect for those with adhd because each sequence is driven and carefully thought of . there are also a number of memorable quotes . one in particular is this one from a cheating husband who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days : `` in pretending to be a man in love , he became a man in love . ''
for my opinion , the middle of the film , specially the love scene is a bit too long , but the whole time you can imagine this desert feeling . but the best , what made this film unforgettable are the great explosion pictures , their color , slowmotion and the pink floyd music are unique in filmhistory ! destruction in its propper and popular form .
midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 , drawing an x rating . by today 's standards , it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating . jon voight , who has been better , is competent in his role as joe buck , an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city . he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo , who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes . the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic . as ratso , dustin hoffman simply shines . hoffman has often been brilliant , but never more so than in this portrayal . he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison . losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences . director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production , but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer . worth seeing for hoffman 's performance alone .
dressed to kill understandably made a bit of a ruckus when first released in 1980 : you had `` police girl '' in a role that was mega-erotic , as angie dicknson played a sexually frustrated housewife looking for good times in all the wrong museums ( and there into apartment elevators ) , plus nancy allen as a call-girl , michael caine as norman bates 's sophisticated new york cousin , and enough lurid imagery to last two movies of the period . today it 's slightly less incriminating by standards and such , though the unrated version has some of the most `` hot '' content of any of de palma 's films , at least in his quasi-auteur period of the 70s and early 80s , where he seemed to repeat themes over and over , ideas taken right off the film-reels of hitchcock classics and given a tawdry uplift . it 's a simple tale that one partly already saw in sisters , and then again to an extent in body double , and also in blow out . cutie allen plays call-girl liz blake , who has to clear her name of suspicion of killing kate ( dickinson , in full blown 'milf ' mode ) , after being found with a razor , the murder weapon from dr. elliott 's office ( michael caine , stone-cold performance most of the way ) . from the start , which de palma seems to do as a way of setting up a dangerous sexual fantasy scene as a way of topping the opening scene of carrie ( which , perhaps , he does just in editing terms ) , we get a series of technical knock-out turns through the point of view of style itself : the tracking shots in the museum , meant to stir up more of a fascination with the process itself , of following and wanting to be followed , than any kind of tension ; the chase through the subway ( a precursor to carlito 's way ) is done with a precise level of suspense , meanwhile , with a slightly exploitation bit thrown in with the black gang ; the character of peter , kate 's son ( keith gordon ) , who plays what is essentially a younger version of the real life de palma as a kid ( science geek , obsessed with hitchcock and voyeurism ) . and it 's all entertaining and entrancing as hell as something that comes close to a real synthesis of what makes de palma 's thrillers so unique while being so self-consciously untainted by a fearless attitude of film-making . on the other hand , that same self-consciousness ended up coming back to bite the director in the butt a few times in recent years , and somehow in dressed to kill it starts to become very erratic and disappointing as the story has to wrap itself up . as the psycho themes come together even more apparently ( man who wants a sex-change , does n't even think he 's killing as it is * she * who is doing it ) , there is an expository scene in the police station that makes the aforementioned hitch film look like an astonishing psychological revelation . and the final scenes at peter 's house , also calling painfully into recollection a much more accomplished sequence in carrie , are meant for a manipulation that even for de palma is asking for it ; the final shot especially , albeit a master 's class in how to copy yourself . yet there is a very deranged and , within itself , perfect scene at the mental hospital amid this confused denouement , where the doctor does some work on a nurse , to which all the other inmates act like animals in a zoo , and an over-head shot going up and up over the scene is one of the best shots of sexual/general perversion ever captured on film . a shame then that the film ends on such a strange and unsettling manner , where up until then it is a remarkable piece of pulp cinema , where class is all around in the technical aspects ( soft lighting , intricate camera movements seemingly so simple ) amid subject matter that should be found in the mix of paperbacks for 25 cents . it 's no masterpiece , but i 'd certainly take it over most of the director 's recent thrillers any day .
this , like murder she wrote , is one of those shows , that after a stressful day at school , i sit down in front of the tv , and watch . why ? because i genuinely enjoy it , and it 's a shame it 's not on the air anymore . dick van dyke is amazing as dr mark sloan , a doctor-turned-detective , who with his son , solves murders . he is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast , namely his real-life son , barry van dyke . victoria rowell is also good , but i noticed that every series her hairstyle changes . i also liked scott baio and charlie schlatter , but i particularly loved michael tucci as norman , and was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared . this show is so entertaining , with great guest stars , it 's a bit obvious at times , like colombo , but in every episode , there is always something to chuckle about . in conclusion , a great series , with two thumbs up and a 10/10 . bethany cox
joan fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself . her husband ( richard ney ) has lost all his money through a combination of his foolhardiness and her extravagance , and they are reduced to living in a tiny room , with little or no prospects . they continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong . he is a charming , feckless , but wholly amiable fellow . however , fontaine decides he has to go , as he has outlived his usefulness . so she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her , so that she can move on . she has meanwhile had a lover ( patric knowles ) whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either . she meets the aging herbert marshall , who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even fontaine could figure out how to spend . she targets him and decides he will do nicely . he is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty . he certainly is n't very exciting , and has about as much sex appeal as yesterday 's omelette . but fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money , and the man standing between her and it is transparent , so that she does n't even notice or care what he looks like , she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it . she proceeds to poison her husband , and dispatches him very neatly and satisfactorily , so that everything is going well . but as always happens in the movies , and sometimes even in life , some unexpected things begin to go wrong , and the tension rises appreciably , so that fontaine begins to sweat . fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified , and as the net begins to close in on her , her rising sense of desperation is palpable and has us on the edges of our seats . hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning . but she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover , who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up . he is condemned to death for murder , because the husband 's death by poison came to light unexpectedly . but sir cedric hardwicke , playing a grimly determined scotland yard inspector , thinks there may be something amiss , and begins to doubt the story and suspect fontaine . he closes in on her , and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the wildest panic . but will the innocent man 's life be saved before he is executed ? will fontaine worm her way out of this one ? will herbert marshall protect her to safeguard his infatuation ? this film is expertly directed by sam wood , and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which i suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir .
stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history , and deservedly so , so i am happy to see any of their films . professor noodle ( lucien littlefield ) is nearing the completion of his rejuvenation formula , with the ability to reverse ageing , after twenty years . ollie and stan are the chimney sweeps that arrive to do their job , and very quickly ollie wants to get away from stan making mistakes . ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the chimney , but stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic . after breaking an extension , stan gets a replacement , a loaded gun , from off the wall , and of course it fires the brush off . stan goes up to have a look , and ollie , standing on the attic door of the roof , falls into the greenhouse . stan asks if he was hurt , and ollie only answers with `` i have nothing to say . '' ollie gets back on the roof , and he and stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in ollie falling down and destroying the chimney . ollie , hatless , in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down , and the butler jessup ( sam adams ) is covered in chimney ash smoke , oh , and ollie still has nothing to say to stan . the boys decide to clean up the mess , and when stan tears the carpet with the shovel , ollie asks `` ca n't you do anything right '' , and stan replies `` i have nothing to say '' , getting the shovel bashed on his head . as ollie holds a bag for stan to shovel in the ashes , they get distracted by a painting on the wall , and the ashes end up down ollie 's trousers , so stan gets another shovel bashed on the head . professor noodle finishes his formula , and does a final test on a duck , with a drop in a tank of water , changing it into a duckling . he also shows the boys his success , turning the duckling into an egg , and he next proposes to use a human subject , i.e . his butler . while he 's gone , the boys decide to test the formula for themselves , but ollie ends up being knocked by stan into the water tank with all the formula . in the end , what was once ollie comes out , an ape , and when stan asks him to speak , all ollie ape says is `` i have nothing to say '' , and stan whimpers . filled with wonderful slapstick and all classic comedy you could want from a black and white film , it is an enjoyable film . stan laurel and oliver hardy were number 7 on the comedians ' comedian . very good !
i felt this film - throughout . i waas impressed with russell crowe 's talent in developing his relationship with lillie , such a typical aussie blend of softly softly approach , a bit self depreciating and very persistent . really loved the cinematography and direction . pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive . gosh , did n't russell 's talent even in 1993 shine ! .. and i have yet to see gladiator .
i do n't know why people except a lot from low budget indie films but i enjoyed this one as i 'm a fan of urban horror . there 's not too many urban horror movies out there so when i saw this one on the shelf , just the title alone peaked my curiosity . so i decided to check it out and i was surprised ... it 's not too often you run into a low budget indie horror film with great acting and a good story . is it low budget ? yes . can you tell that it 's low budget ? yes ... but once you start watching the movie you become so wrapped up in the story that it does n't matter . i like hip hop music too and the soundtrack is nice ! i do n't know what 's up with all these bad reviews for this film . all i hear is `` worst movie ever '' . have these idiots seen every movie out there ? there 's thousands of movies out there , how can you categorize one as the `` worst '' ever ? a video not `` movie '' like `` zombiez '' may be the worst film i ever seen but i ca n't say that it 's the worst movie ever since i have n't seen every movie out there . bottom line these people who gave this movie bad reviews are probably from the suburbs . listen , if you do n't like minority based , urban films , the ghetto films , hip hop , etc then why watch these types of movies ? ? ? ! ! ! knowing that you do n't like this type of stuff ? sure , this is a horror film but it 's not just a horror film but it 's an urban horror film with a multi-cultural based cast . i do n't like tv shows like dawson 's creek or the o.c. , they suck to me . films like `` garden state '' , `` wedding crashers '' and `` i heart huckabees '' suck to me . i 'm a guy from new jersey and these shows and movies suck to me . why ? because i ca n't relate to them . they do n't peak my interest . just common sense . believe me , i will never watch garden state 2 : garden salad , wedding crashers 2 : here 's a sequel to torture you again since the first sucked so bad and i heart huckaboring . now back to this movie , in regards to saint405 's comment above , i do n't know if this guy was smoking crack or got knocked `` stupid '' by his drunken dad before he watched the movie but to me , everyone did a great job . the actor who played ricky ( i forgot his name ) did a very good job . i 'm an aspiring actor myself taking theater at my school and i had to do a play where i had to cry and it 's not easy to be emotional in a scene so i give props to actors who have to do an emotional scene and can pull it off . anywho , i liked this movie and never heard of these actors and directors before but you bet i 'll be looking out for their stuff for now on and if they are reading this , bring on the sequel ! ! ! i 'm out . jerzee representin ' !
five deadly venoms is not as bloody and violent as story of ricky or super ninjas , but it features some of the best hand-to-hand fight sequences in hong kong film history . director chang cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece . this movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms . meng lo plays yet another bad ass . he would go on to be in super ninjas . kuo chui who is philip kwok would go on to story of ricky and hard boiled . any chop socky fan can apperciate this . but i still think it ai n't as good as super ninjas ( also made by chang cheh ) . but all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best .
this is a ripsnorting , old-fashioned adventure yarn . i understand that by today 's political standards , the treatment of the indians was unacceptable . but this moving is n't about politics . it 's about action , dialogue , comradery , acting , direction , music , and photography , and it 's marvelous on all these factors . grant , fairbanks , and mclaglen are electric together , and jaffe is superb . this is the ultimate buddy movie .
this happens to be one of my favorite horror films . it 's a rich , classy production boasting an excellent cast of ensemble actors , beautiful on-location cinematography , a haunting musical score , an intelligent and novel plot theme , and an atmosphere of dread and menace . it 's reminiscent of such classic films as rosemary 's baby and the shining , wherein young , vulnerable women find themselves victimized by supernatural forces in old , creepy buildings with a macabre past . here , cristina raines plays a top new york city fashion model named alison parker . her happy , outgoing exterior masks a deeply conflicted and troubled soul . this is evidenced by the revelation that in her past , she attempted suicide twice- once as a teenage girl after walking in on her degenerate father cavorting in bed with two women and having him rip a silver crucifix from her neck and toss it on the floor , and the second time , after her married lawyer-boyfriend 's wife supposedly committed suicide over learning of their affair . telling her beau ( played by a suitably slimy chris sarandon ) that she needs to live on her own for a year or so , she answers a newspaper ad for a fully-furnished , spacious one-bedroom apartment in an old brooklyn heights brownstone . this building actually exists and is located at 10 montague terrace right by the brooklyn heights promenade off remsen street . the producers actually filmed inside the building and its apartments , paying the residents for their inconvenience , of course . the real estate agent , a miss logan ( ava gardner ) , seems to be very interested in having alison take the apartment- an interest that can not be solely explained by the 6 % commission she would earn . especially when she quickly drops the rental price from $ 500.00 a month to $ 400.00 . alison agrees and upon leaving the building with miss logan , notices an elderly man sitting and apparently staring at her from the top-floor window . miss logan identifies the man to her as father halliran and tells alison that he 's blind . alison 's response is very logical- `` blind ? then what does he look at ? '' after moving in , alison meets some of the other residents in the building , including a lesbian couple played by sylvia miles and beverly d'angelo , who provide alison with an uncomfortable welcome to the building . alison 's mental health and physical well-being soon start to deteriorate and she is plagued by splitting headaches and fainting spells . when she relays her concerns to miss logan about her sleep being disturbed on a nightly basis by clanging metal and loud footsteps coming from the apartment directly over her , she is dumbstruck to learn that apart from the blind priest and now herself , no one has lived in that building for the last three years . summoning the courage one night to confront her nocturnal tormentor , she arms herself with a butcher knife and a flashlight and enters the apartment upstairs . she is confronted by the cancer-riddled specter of her dead father and uses the knife on him in self-defense when he comes after her . the police investigate and find no sign of violence in that apartment- no corpse , no blood , nothing . yet alison fled the building and collapsed in the street , covered in blood- her own , as it turns out . but there 's nary a mark on her . what alison does n't realize until the film 's denouement is that her being in that brownstone has a purpose . she was put there for a reason- a reason whose origin dates back to the biblical story of the garden of eden and of the angel uriel who was posted at its entrance to guard it from the devil . she is being unknowingly primed and prepped by the catholic church to assume a most important role- one that will guarantee that her soul , which is damned for her two suicide attempts , can be saved . at the same time , the `` invisible '' neighbors , who turn out to be more than just quirky oddballs , have a different agenda in mind for her . this is a competent and intelligently done film and one that surprisingly portrays the church and its representatives in a mostly sympathetic light .
this is the kind of film you want to see with a glass of wine , the fire on , and with your feet up . it does n't require that much brain-power to follow , so is very good after a long day . i would say it is very unrealistic - if you expecting anything serious , then do n't bother , but it is very funny . just the thought that a businessman would go so far as to agree to live in a slum for a while , and then actually get to enjoy it ... i would definitely recommend it .
this is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong . a simple robbery . pick up some serious change . get our finances together and everything will be hunky-dory . butmom and pop 's jewelry store ? no problem . insurance pays for it all . no guns . nobody gets hurt . easy money . older , more successful ( it would appear ) brother andy ( philip seymour hoffman ) has a few minor problems . heroin addiction , cocaine habituation . a wife ( marisa tomei ) that well , he ca n't seem to perform for . his flat belly days long gone . younger , sweet , slightly dim-witted younger brother , hank ( ethan hawke ) with a few dinero problems of his own . behind in child support payments for his daughter , in debt to friends and relatives , not exactly wowing them in the work of work , etc . sydney lumet , in this performance at the age of 82 ( ! ) , directs and gets it 99.99 percent right , which is hard to do in a thriller . i have seen more thrillers than i can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes , the improbabilities , the cheesy scenes , and the hurry-up ending . here lumet makes a thriller like it 's a work of art . every detail is perfect . the acting is superb . the plot has no holes . the story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the bard himself . hoffman of course is excellent . when you do n't have marquee , leading man presence , you have to get by on talent , workmanship and pure concentration . ethan hawke , who is no stranger to the sweet , little guy role , adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we do n't know whether to pity him or trash him . albert finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age . and marisa tomei , who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity , manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as andy 's two timing wife . ( but who could blame her ? ) it 's almost a movie reviewer 's sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars , but if you study this film , as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do , you will notice the kind of excessive ( according to most hollywood producers ) attention to detail that makes for real art -- the sort of thing that only great artists can do , and indeed can not help but do . ( by the way , i think there were twenty producers on this filmwell , maybe a dozen ; check the credits . ) all i can say in summation is , way to go sydney lumet , author of a slew of excellent films , and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced agekudos . may we all do half so well . okay , the 00.01 percent . it was unlikely that the father ( albert finney ) could have followed the cabs that andy took around new york without somehow losing the tail . this is minor , and i wish all thrillers could have so small a blip . also one wonders why lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of hank at the end . we can guess and guess . perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor . perhaps lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out , and he just said , `` leave it like that . it really does n't matter . '' and i think it does n't . what happens to hank is not going to be good . he is n't the kind of guy who manages to run off to mexico and is able to start a new life . he is the kind of guy who gets a `` light '' sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he was n't really a man when he should have been . see this for sidney lumet , one of hollywood 's best , director of the pawnbroker ( 1964 ) , the group ( 1966 ) , serpico ( 1973 ) , dog day afternoon ( 1975 ) , network ( 1976 ) , and many more .
i had heard some not too good things about this movie and had probably seen the low score here at imdb and that 's why i had avoided it . today they showed vanilla sky on tv and as i had nothing better to do ... and as it turned out , i would have had a hard time finding anything better to do . vanilla sky is a frightening , sad and touching movie , actually one of the best i 've seen in a while . i was surprised by how i was affected watching it . it 's hard to explain , but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it 's quite an emotional journey . vanilla sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie , or any media for that matter . i really recommend everyone to watch this movie . regardless of what you have heard about it .
what would happened when a depressed cop works with a shrink on probation ? may be a lot of fun ... this movie set a benchmark in the action/comedy genre of the argentinean cinema . dearable characters , probable story and a pace that between laughs has some thrill . i recommended it for a pleasant time of entertaining . peretti and luque join their efforts to fight against a cold and daringly foe in a time when it 's difficult to trust someone . this movie will surprise you , the other side of the coin of `` analyze me '' , but not alike , with nothing to envy . and if you like to know bs.as there where few scenes of downtown and the city center .
`` el mar '' directed by catalonian director agusti villarona , and based on the novel by blai bonet , offers a glimpse of the spanish history as seen by a balearic author that takes the viewer back to the days of the civil war in that country . the movie concentrates on three friends , and follows them from those early days during the onset of the war in majorca , to a few years later as two of those friends meet again when they are at a sanatorium , lost in the countryside . we first meet three boys that are playing happily . not everything is what it seems . the tragic death of one of them points out about the cruelty of the one that commits the evil deed . the boys have excluded a young girl , about their age , from taking part in their games . when we meet the adult ramallo again , he is on his way to a sanatorium . he seems to be suffering from tuberculosis . to his surprise , manuel tur , one of his boyhood friends is also being treated , and the young girl that was not welcomed to participate in their games is now one of the nuns that supervise their health care . it is obvious that tur looks at ramallo in a way that only means he is in love with the tough bully . their relationship will have devastating consequences . roger casamajor does a good job with portraying the older ramallo . bruno bergonzino makes an impression as tur , the vulnerable youth . antonia torrens plays sor francisca with conviction . angela molina , puts an appearance as carmen , the wife of the caretaker of the institution . simon andreu is perfect as alcantara . `` el mar '' is a dark film that clearly shows agusti villarona 's talents in making the novel come alive for the viewer .
there 's no romance or other side plot to this movie , it 's action and intrigue all the way , making it a real man 's kung-fu movie . an aging master dispatches his last disciple yan tieh to stop his five former pupils who 's styles represents five venomous animals centipede , snake , scorpion , lizard and the toad . despite the word `` venom '' in the title , none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents . yan tieh told by his teacher that he 's no match for the five former pupil , must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four . how yan tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story , with good kung-fu action spread out throughout the story . recognized as a cult classic , this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung- fu action movies . it 's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story . it 's no artistic masterpiece , with the usual bad dubbing , and corny acting , but the movie is one of the best of its kind , because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung-fu action movie of its time , and gives an extra concentrated dose of them . one movie you must watch if you are a kung-fu movie fan .
12 year old arnald hillerman accidentally kills his older brother eugene . his feelings are arrested by the fact that his family can not interact with him ( or feel it is not the right thing to do ) . his only refuge is his grandfather , who is the only one who seems to have compassion on him . the realism will captivate `` true-2-life '' movie lovers , but will not satisfy those that desire action & thrills .
first saw this movie in about 1990 , and absolutely died laughing through it . it became a cult favorite with my circle of friends , and we 'd quote from it at the drop of a hat ( `` i 'm going home in a bag ! '' ) . needless to say , the humor is still there , 15 years later . it 's become a tradition at halloween time to expose many of my new friends to this film ( good thing you can still buy it off ebay ! ) i 've found that halloween candy tastes much better with your tongue planted firmly in your cheek .. and this movie provides it all- pathos , suspense , unrequited love , nobility and the list goes on . royal dano provides an amazing heartfelt performance as old man wrenchmuller . i remember seeing him in `` the 7 faces of dr. lao '' as a bad guy who met a bad end . here , you really feel for the old guy right from the beginning . if you are n't careful , you 'll miss some of the levels of humor in this movie . the creators got real subtle in many ways with offhand comments , little subtle costume digs at other sci-fi movies , and even a scene ripped from the pages of wile e. coyote ! do n't spend too much thought processes trying to analyze a movie , people- this is fun fare without the need for nitpicking , and should n't be offensive to anyone ( well , maybe stupid people , but they wo n't know they 're being mocked .. ) . -now if you 'll excuse me , i 'm gon na go get a 'zag-nut ' bar .... -ramsay `` rc '' cowlishaw , karaoke dj/entertainer
french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene . maléfique preceded the revival just slightly , but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made ! maléfique was obviously shot on a low budget , but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film , and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner . the plot focuses on two main ideas ; prison and black magic . the central character is a man named carrère , sent to prison for fraud . he is put in a cell with three others ; the quietly insane lassalle , body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy . after a short while in the cell together , they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal . after translating part of it , they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls . black magic is a very interesting topic , and i 'm actually quite surprised that there are n't more films based on it as there 's so much scope for things to do with it . it 's fair to say that maléfique makes the best of it 's assets as despite it 's restraints , the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout . director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film ; the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic , and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell - it 's very easy to get behind them ! it 's often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people , and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner , and this helps to ensure that maléfique actually does manage to be quite frightening ! the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot ; the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done . anyone worried that the film wo n't deliver by the end wo n't be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying ! overall , maléfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade - highly recommended viewing !
perhaps the best isabel allende 's book , house of the spirits describes an alternative chilean history , this one full of magic , a mystic veil , plus some kind of omnipresent sadness . this movie gathers a great cast , plus a great art direction , with a script that can not contain all this book 's quality . it 's unusual for a nearly unknown country like chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie , whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high , and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset , mostly because they understood very little .
sure this movie was n't like . 16 blocks , inside man , an american haunting . etc ... but it was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us .. i found this movie really great and scary . i live exactly where they filmed this movie `` san pedro , california '' and we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie . i dunno if you 've heard of the famous boat in long beach `` queen mary '' well that boat is haunted . i believe in spirts , illusions , and parallel or however u spell that . is real . everybody 's in there own universe . and the mind is a powerful thing . i recommend to watch this movie . it 's great , and not bad directing at all . for those who rate it a 1. they do n't understand the film . its meaning . its plot , its view . and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us . ty . victor
a great 90 's flick ! parker posey is fabulous in this story about the nightlife in manhattan that requires so much cash . posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler . this is a good , light movie for saturday night before you go out . the soundtrack rocks , the outfits are out of this world , the script is funny and the actors do a great job . the redeeming value : you can make it in this world if you try , just find your niche . i believe parker posey is the perfect actress for this kind of character : young , fabulous and broke . ( you must look up the movie `` clockwatchers '' ) . if you watch party girl you are bound to have a good time . enjoy !
i 'm not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a `` master '' in the genre of horror , since he previously just directed one horror film called `` wrong turn '' and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre , but fact is that he made with `` right to die '' one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the `` masters of horror '' franchise . there was a similar underdog story in season one , when william malone made on of the best episodes with `` the fair haired child '' even though his other long feature films `` fear dot com '' and `` house on haunted hill '' sucked pretty badly . the story of `` right to die '' cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia , but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance , murderous conspiracies , pitch black humor and comic book styled violence . whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband 's continuous adultery , the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident . cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially . whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney ( corbin bernsen of `` the dentist '' ) want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor , abbey 's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff . meanwhile abbey 's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff 's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices . after a few victims , cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well . `` right to die '' is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv-series concept like `` masters of horror '' . it 's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences . the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well , yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons . the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling . actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks , which is always a welcome plus , and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard . great `` moh '' episode ; definitely one of the highlights of both seasons .
... dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial , brain-dead and pointless . the film is excellent , the acting by both denzel and dakota ( she will go sky high , trust me on that ) are just fabulous , and the plot is mind blowing . actually `` fabulous '' is a small word to use for such talented actors . the film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional , a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film . if you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films , you still have n't watched your favorite one yet ... trust me , in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling . the film is awesome , see it , rent it , buy it or whatever ... just do n't miss it
the young dr. fanshawe ( mark letheren ) , an avid archaeologist , is dispatched by his museum boss to the large country home of squire richards ( pip torrens ) , where his task is to find provenance for and catalogue the collection of antiquities and curios belonging to the recently deceased father of the squire . the squire is surprised by the arrival fanshawe , he had n't been expecting him for another week , but none the less welcomes him and gets his only servant , patten ( david burke .. of dr watson fame ) , to show him to his room , as fanshawe must stay over for some days in order to finish his rather large task . patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that fanshawe 's visit will entail , the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking , cleaning and maintenance for him . fanshawe is a fussy sort , very neat and precise with everything having its place , whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room . needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work , but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit , so he asks the squire for a replacement pair , the squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters , is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house , so he obliges and walks fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages , there the squire directs him to points of interest , including gallows hill , where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours , his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the squire describes as a ruin , but fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly is n't , he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants ? fanshawe does n't have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched , he feels a presence , he begins to see moving shadows in the woods , startled he runs home . over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the squire , patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it .. the binoculars ! they used to belong to a local man called baxter , whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from gallows hill , boiling them up for some concoction or other , baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night , the late squire had acquired his belongings , including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area . these etchings fascinate fanshawe as they portray the abbey he seen through his binoculars , but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of henry vii and so it would be impossible for baxter to have drawn the sketches , never the less they are signed and dated by baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power . that night he has horrifically vivid dreams , when he wakes , he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them , what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so ? fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession , as darkness falls the squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist , they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above gallows hill , they quicken their speed , but will they be in time to help or save fanshawe from his destiny ? the ghost story for christmas series of films made by the bbc sadly ended its initial run of films in 1978 with the ice house , they were for the most part based on the work of the great m.r . james . in 2005 and 2006 the series was revived briefly and thankfully a view from a hill also marked a return to the work of james , whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers . director luke watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films , but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great ghost story , his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax , all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum , thus upping the tension and mystery . the autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere , the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come . the cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles . the idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective , the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye can not see , may even have influenced álex de la iglesia in his film la habitación del niño ( 2006 ) of the following year , with which it bears striking similarity . i had heard mixed reviews of this particular film , but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers , something that does n't happen much these days , i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing , which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow . plenty of time is given , even within its brief 40 minutes running time , for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade .
in this installment of the series , edmund blackadder is stuck in the regency period in britain ( during the later portion of george iii 's rule ) . this time , blackadder 's prospects are much poorer -- as instead of royalty , he 's a servant to the very , very thick george iv ( the price regent ) . unlike the historical accounts of george iv , this one is about as bright as a tomato and as a result , blackadder 's able to take advantage of him and scheme to his heart 's content . the only major difference in style between this one and earlier ones is that the series ends on a very , very , very different note -- you just have to see it to believe it . other than that , all the usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious . the only reservation i have ( as always ) is that this show is not appropriate for the kids due to its crude language and adult situations .
the great cinematic musicals were made between 1950 and 1970 . this twenty year spell can be rightly labelled the “ golden era ” of the genre . there were musicals prior to that , and there have been musicals since… but the true classics seem invariably to have been made during that period . singin ’ in the rain , an american in paris , the band wagon , seven brides for seven brothers , oklahoma , south pacific , the king and i , and many more , stand tall as much cherished products of the age . perhaps the last great musical of the “ golden era ” is carol reed ’ s 1968 “ oliver ” . freely adapted from dickens ’ novel , this vibrant musical is a film version of a successful stage production . it is a magnificent film , winner of six oscars , including the best picture award . orphan oliver twist ( mark lester ) lives a miserable existence in a workhouse , his mother having died moments after giving birth to him . following an incident one meal-time , he is booted out of the workhouse and ends up employed at a funeral parlour . but oliver doesn ’ t settle particularly well into his new job , and escapes after a few troubled days . he makes the long journey to london where he hopes to seek his fortune . oliver is taken under the wing of a child pickpocket called the artful dodger ( jack wild ) who in turn works for fagin ( ron moody ) , an elderly crook in charge of a gang of child-thieves . despite the unlawful nature of the job , oliver finds good friends among his new “ family ” . he also makes the acquaintance of nancy ( shani wallis ) , girlfriend of the cruellest and most feared thief of them all , the menacing bill sikes ( oliver reed ) . after many adventures , oliver discovers his true ancestry and finds that he is actually from a rich and well-to-do background . but his chances of being reunited with his real family are jeopardised when bill sikes forcibly exploits oliver , making him an accomplice in some particularly risky and ambitious robberies . “ oliver ” is a brilliantly assembled film , consistently pleasing to the eye and excellently acted by its talented cast . moody recreates his stage role with considerable verve , stealing the film from the youngsters with his energetic performance as fagin . lester and wild do well too as the young pickpockets , while wallis enthusiastically fleshes out the nancy role and reed generates genuine despicableness as sikes . the musical numbers are staged with incredible precision and sense of spectacle – onna white ’ s oscar-winning choreography helps make the song-and-dance set pieces so memorable , but the lively performers and the skillful direction of carol reed also play their part . the unforgettable tunes include “ food glorious food ” , “ consider yourself ” , “ you ’ ve got to pick a pocket or two ” , “ i ’ d do anything ” and “ oom-pah-pah ” – all immensely catchy songs , conveyed via very well put together sequences . the film is a thoroughly entertaining experience and never really loses momentum over its entire 153 minute duration . sit back and enjoy !
this is like `` crouching tiger , hidden dragon '' in a more surreal , fantasy setting with incredible special effects and computer generated imagery that would put industrial light and magic to shame . the plot may be hard to follow , but that is the nature of translating chinese folklore to the screen ; certainly the overall story would probably be more familiar to its native audience . however , an intelligent person should be able to keep up ; moreover , the martial arts scenes potency are amplified by eye popping cgi .
i ca n't understand why they decided to release this film to introduce the american audience to the dynamo that is jet li . fist of legend would have been a much better choice . anyway , black mask is n't terrible , but it certainly is n't great either . the final fight sequence is well staged by yuen woo ping who went on to coordinate the matrix . but the english release suffers from rough editing and dubbing . ( i 'm begging the hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles . ) jet li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role and francoise yip has a cool but brief role as the female 701 . black mask has a strange goth style that adds some interest but it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions . more focus on li 's fantastic physical skills were in order . black mask is a decent film but do yourself a favor and pick up fist of legend if you want to see a tremendous film that really shows li 's skills .
best of the zorro serials and one of my favorite serials , period . this is a period serial set right after the birth of mexico . the new nation is counting on the gold produced by this one town to keep the republic solvent . however a gold god , don del oro is stirring up the indians and stealing the gold for himself . its zorro and his band of men to the rescue . reed hadley is a winning zorro and he cuts a dashing figure as he gets into a nice selection of scraps ( most all of which were reused by the later zorro serials as well as other serials as well ) .the story moves and its nicely not clear who the real bad guy is . there is a reason that i 've seen this the most of any serial i 've seen , its simply a great action adventure film . the only thing i can compare it to is the mark of zorro with tyrone power or one of the other swashbucklers of the period . its super and highly recommended .
several posters have quoted renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing ingrid bergman smiling to camera . the short answer is would n't we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so . at this stage of her career bergman could n't get arrested ; in 1949 she left hollywood to make a picture in europe , fell for director roberto rossellini and never looked forward . after five turkeys in italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year , after making this for renoir , she was back where she belonged and with an oscar to boot for anastasia . this is one of three movies that renoir made in color around this time and on balance it 's better than the golden coach , which is n't hard , and about even with french can can . renoir probably figured that with so much going for her bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and renoir picked two doozys in jean marais and mel ferrer , solid mahogany in both cases . the plot is actually based on a real incident in french history but renoir is content to give it a once-over-lightly and concentrate on replicating the paintings of his father in set up after set up . in its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period les grandes manouvres which is no bad thing . all in all it remains a pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress .
this picks up about a year after the events in `` basic instinct '' . catherine tramell ( sharon stone ) is now in london . while having sex with a soccer player while speeding about in a car going at 110 miles/hour ( do n't ask ) she goes off the road and ends up in the thames . she survives -- he does n't . the police hire psychiatrist michael glass ( david morrissey ) to see if she 's mentally competent to stand trial . naturally she starts playing with his mind instead and plenty of murders and sex follow . this movie was doomed before it even opened . it took forever to get a cast and director , script problems were constant and the cast was not happy ( morrissey complained about the movie often ) . still it 's not too bad . it 's a lot like the first -- there 's a lush music score , beautiful locations , plenty of sex and nudity ( this had to be edited for an r ) , a nicely convoluted plot and good acting -- but there 's no impact . it feels like a retread of the first . people are being killed here with a choker leash ( i believe ) ... just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first . in one cute moment stone picks up an ice pick and looks at it longingly . she 's also playing mind games with a man and might be getting him implicated in murders . the similarities are too apparent . this is also very r rated -- there 's plenty of explicit sex talk , male nudity ( morrissey looks a lot better nude than michael douglas ) , female nudity ( stone still looks great ) and some bloody murders . the acting is good across the board . stone is just fantastic here ; morrissey looks miserable but is ok ; charlotte rampling and david thewlis are good in supporting roles . so -- this is n't at all bad but feels like a remake of the first . still i recommend it . people just attacked this because stone is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to `` basic ... '' 14 years after it was made .
i saw this movie on the bifff festival in brussel , spring 2004 . what a surprise ! this german production , a stylish and imaginative shocker , is one of the scariest flic i have seen . be warned : this is not a joke ! this terrorizer has a big cast of good actors ( as an example : peter martell as a european guru has a strong presence ) , excellent direction , nice production design , a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like italian horror movies in the eighties . flesh ripped clean to the bone ... and the blood runs red ... this savage heart stopper will grip you ... and give you some dark dreams ... a must-see ! !
this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life . the pacing , the camera work , the emotion , the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see . it is n't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally stunted . the only flaw i can see about this film is that it was n't captured in a more technically perfect film format . it deserved todd-ao , technicolor and the very finest sound format available . ( an intimate film can be made in seventy millimeter . ) the gorgeous italian villas effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more lushly and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard . as it is , it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film . i ca n't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on satelite . the transformations of the characters from contained , tight and mistrustful is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more often . the casting is perfect , the mood is perfect , the acting is above reproach . it is a film about middle age and the choices people make.it is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy handedness . watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you . if you do n't get it , perhaps you have n't lived enough , or something else is wrong with you .
just saw this exquisite 1982 movie return of the soldier , based on rebecca west 's novel . its about a shell-shocked fortyish captain who does n't even tell his wife he has returned to british soil , but remains in a hospital in london . he 's lost his memory and is a boy again , with a lingering yen for the lower class sweetheart he pursued 25 years earlier . its a delicate story . he is lingering in his boyhood , while the reader discovers his wife is an unbearable , aspiring socialite who wants him to resume his place in society . living with them is his cousin jenny , who loved chris baldry the soldier , when they were growing up as playmates , but has settled into spinsterhood . the lower class woman , played by glenda jackson , is margaret gray . it is she who is notified that chris is back in england . chris ' wife kitty is shocked when mrs. gray comes to tell her that chris is in a hospital in london . kitty ( julie christie ) is vacuous and snobbish . why , she asks herself , was this other woman sent a telegraph about chris rather than her ? chris has forgotten totally about kitty . he wants to renew his relationship with margaret . the now married margaret is reluctant to meet him , but then does and continues to meet with him . there is a psychiatrist ( ian holm ) who warns kitty and jenny that chris ' temporary happiness with margaret will disappear if he 'cures ' him . jenny realizes how empty kitty is for chris and forms a secret loving alliance through margaret . they both are in love with him . jenny wants to help . late in the film kitty reveals that chris and she had a boy who died five years ago . telling chris this , weighs the shrink , will certainly restore him to 'normal . ' but is this a good idea ? chris , barely aware that he and kitty were ever married , is unaware of his child and the child 's death . the psychiatrist , just learning of the child , believes such knowledge will restore chris . jenny and margaret have chris all to themselves because kitty believes he is faking and refuses to accept chris 's illness in reverting to his youth in his forties . the film leaves her mostly out of consideration concerning whats to be done with chris . but jenny and margaret , in the child 's perfectly maintained bedroom- with kitty too in the novel , but not in the screenplay- discuss what they believe should be done about chris from their separate perspectives . margaret is the critical one here , because , though married , she has half fallen in love with chris again . jenny 's social stature , jenny believes , will be threatened if chris does not right himself . she does not reveal this to margaret , however . margaret decides , looking ahead , that chris can not maintain his fantasy over time , but must return to something like a real life . while kitty and jenny look on from the window of the house , margaret approaches chris outside and tells him of his lost son . the buoyant war victim 's head sinks , his shoulders slump , he looks away . he walks dejectedly toward the house . fin i read some criticism of this first novel of rebecca west . the novel was written something after the first war . the movie is never quite clear who jenny is , his cousin or his sister . it would be more rousing if she were his sister , of course . the criticism does n't make it clear either . i 'm sure west in her novel , makes sure jenny is her cousin , not her sister . west is no henry miller nor an anais nin , whose book incest ( about her relationship with her father as an adult to get even with him for molesting her as a child ) i considered reading , but then decided against . rebecca the author has a need to restore chris too . she too has outposts in her head for the society her novel excoriates first but finally embraces once more .
i initially bought this dvd because it had srk and aishwarya rai on the cover and i thought , hey ! another film starring aishu and shah rukh , little did i know that aishwarya would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with srk and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes . shakti is a film about a mother 's love and endurance . it 's a film about transformations , ignorance , coming of age , stepping into the know and embracing the harsh realities of life . the item number in which srk and aishu appear in has nothing to do with the movie . it 's actually a dream sequence that occurs while srk 's drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze . he dreams that aishwarya rai is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite hangout spot one day , dressed scantily and begins to seduce him . the title of the song is 'ishq kamina ' ( loosely translated as `` love 's a bitch ! '' ) and it is just plain smoking hot ! do n't miss it .
it 's amazing that from a good , though not wonderful , film made back in the early nineties , a whole franchise can grow . 'stargate ; sg1 ' is , without a doubt , a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 'star trek ' as the kings of sci-fi . following on from the 1994 feature film 'stargate ' , this series sees stargate command ( a military/science organisation ) figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore . sg1 is one such team , headed by military veteran colonel jack o'neill , and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson , military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal ' c , who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people . earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa'uld , a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods . the top-notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life . richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o'neill , who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye . michael shanks , as daniel , brings heart and an will of steel to the character , who has grown from wide-eyed innocence to darker and more hard-bitten as the show has progressed . amanda tapping , as carter , has perfected the balance between depicting her character 's femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong , intelligent military scientist . christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal ' c , who is able to depict the character 's emotions with subtlety . and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness . almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence , reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs ( often shown through arguments between o'neill and jackson ) . guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that does n't bore viewers . sg1 also excels in humour , from o'neill 's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd ! sg1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death . it is n't just an excellent sci-fi show but is an excellent show , overall .
this is one of those movies that i 've seen so many times that i can quote most of it . some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable . i particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk , go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose . i do n't know how many times i have seen this sequence but it 's funny every time . from the moment arthur gets to susan 's dad 's place to the bit with the moose , you pretty much laugh the whole time . i remember watching the out-takes regarding the bit with the moose . it went down just like i 'd imagined it 'd be like . they were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it . the late sir john gielgud was a wonderful addition to this . his demeanor , his one-liners and the way he handled arthur were all equally hilarious . it 's always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he 's a spoiled little ____ . i laugh every time i listen to the `` i 'm going to have a bath '' and the lines that follow .
how strange the human mind is ; this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored , and in which one 's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain , this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory . and how much do we really know of it 's inner-workings , of it 's depth or capacity ? what is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream ? or can we ? perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see , like looking at a painting by monet , in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality . it 's a concept visited by filmmaker cameron crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film , ` vanilla sky , ' starring tom cruise and penelope cruz . at the age of thirty-three , david aames ( cruise ) inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father . his fifty-one percent controlling interest , however , has made him something of a marked man , as there are seven members of his board of directors , and each deems himself more worthy than the young mr. aames of the lion 's share of the company . and fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that david lacks the focus the job requires . admittedly , david likes to play ; still , he 's in control of the business and does what he sees fit , whether the board ( he refers to them as the ` seven dwarfs ' ) likes it or not , and no one has ever had the courage to challenge him directly . but during a lavish birthday party in his honor , one of the corporate lawyers , thomas tipp ( timothy spall ) warns david that the seven are up to something behind his back . at the time , however , it 's the last thing on david 's mind ; he 's been having a casual affair with a friend , julie gianni ( cameron diaz ) , but even that moves to the back burner when he meets a woman at his party that he ca n't get out of his mind . her name is sofia ( penelope cruz ) , and after knowing her for only one night , she becomes a pivotal part of his life -- which is about to be turned upside down , as on the morning after his party he makes a decision that will change his life forever . and he is about to learn that sometimes , there is simply no going back . director cameron crowe has crafted and delivered much more than just another film with this one ; far more than a movie , ` vanilla sky ' is a vision realized . beginning with the first images that appear on screen , he presents a visually stunning experience that is both viscerally and cerebrally affecting . it 's a mind-twisting mystery that will swallow you up and sweep you away ; emotionally , it 's a rush -- and it may leave you exhausted , because it requires some effort to stay with it . but it 's worth it . think ` memento ' with a driving rock n ' roll soundtrack and a vibrant assault of colors proffered by the stroke of an impressionist 's brush . there 's darkness and light , and sounds that pound and drive until you can feel the blood rushing through your veins and throbbing in your brain . and all played out on a landscape of virtual reality swirling beneath that ever expanding vanilla sky . simply put , this one 's a real trip ; it 's exciting -- and it 's a mind bender . as to the performances here , those who ca n't get past the mind-set of tom cruise as maverick in ` top gun , ' or his ethan hunt in ` mission impossible , ' or those who perceive him only as a ` movie star ' rather than an actor , are going to have to think again in light of his work here . because as david aames , cruise gives the best performance of his career , one that should check any doubts as to his ability as an actor at the door . he 's made some interesting career choices the past few years , with films like ` magnolia ' and ` eyes wide shut ' merely warm-ups for the very real and complex character he creates here . and give him credit , too , for taking on a role that dispels any sense of vanity ; this is cruise as you 've never seen him before . ` jerry maguire ' earned him an oscar nomination , and this one should , also -- as well as the admiration and acclaim of his peers . cruise is not just good in this movie , he is remarkable . penelope cruz turns in an outstanding , if not exceptional performance , as well , as sofia , the woman of david 's dreams . there 's an alluring innocence she brings to this role that works well for her character and makes her forthcoming and accessible , yet she lacks any hint of mystery that may have added that special ` something extra ' to the part . but crowe knows how to get the best out of his actors , and he certainly did with cruz . he also knew what he was doing with cameron diaz , who is absolutely vibrant in the role of julie . she 's never looked better , and fairly sizzles on screen . but make no mistake , this is no ` window-dressing ' part , and diaz delivers a complete package with this character . the quality of her performance can be measured , in fact , in the impact she makes with rather limited screen time . and it 's the persona she integrates so fully with her innate beauty that makes julie so unforgettable . overall , a terrific job by diaz . the supporting cast includes kurt russell ( dr. mccabe ) , jason lee ( brian ) , johnny galecki ( peter ) , armand schultz ( dr. pomerantz ) , noah taylor ( ed ) , mel thompson ( ` l.e . ' man ) , jean carol ( woman in new york ) and john fedevich ( silent ed ) . about half-way through , this one may have you questioning your own sense of reality ; but rest assured , by the end of ` vanilla sky ' all will be revealed . it 's a reality-bender , to be sure , and a wild one ; but this is exciting entertainment that offers a satisfying -- and unique -- experience , one you have to see to believe . it 's the essential , and absolute , magic of the movies . 10/10 .
i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk . well actually , it does n't , because this film is everything a hollywood film is n't - original , creative , quirky and humorous . it seems that today no-one really wants to see this type of movie as , in the simplest terms , it does n't conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film . i have n't written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention , even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes ! essentially , it is about nothing , as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world . the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise-en-scene consists of half a house and a vast white , empty space . this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors , both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles . i 'd love to write some more but am on quite a time limit . however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try . a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed fashion , with the combination of good performances , a strong script , nice sound design and ( fairly ) impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie . it 's just a shame so few people know about nothing ....
this film , in my opinion , is , despite it 's flaws ( which i maintain are * few * ) , an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art . what mr. bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films . he does not receive 1/100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience . if it were not for mr. bakshi , i do n't believe animation would have survived the disney onslaught . what is more , with the lord of the rings , he has not only created a beautiful animated film , but he has created an entirely new art form - unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground . most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film ( the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation ) . but i feel that the people who complain about it simply can not accept an art form which is out of the norm . no , this is not disney animation . no it 's not live action . no , it 's not `` cheating '' - what it is is a new , fascinating , and absolutely wonderful art form . something so fresh , and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as `` the lord of the rings '' . bakshi 's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way , in particular , the darker of tolkien 's creatures , particularly the nazgul , are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish . peter s. beagle 's screenplay ( based very little , as i understand it , on an early draft by chris conkling ) is a very loyal adaptation of tolkien 's works . where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created . there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film , but there are very few changes to the storyline . there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled : the reforging of narsil , the gifts of galadriel , the huorns at the battle of the hornburg , but , again , with the time limitations he had ( already the longest animated feature in history ) , these are certainly understandable ( though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel ) . also there is the delightful ( one of my favorites ) score by leonard rosenman ( who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv ( the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work ) ) . it is bombastic and audacious and , dare i say , perfect . it stands on it 's own as an orchestral triumph , but when coupled with the images of the film , it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection . so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off . the voice actors are wonderful . of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of strider . the character design is also wonderfully unique , though not often to everyone 's taste . but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he/she imagines , not what you might have imagined , and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb . this is perhaps not what you imagined , but i can only applaud mr. bakshi for showing us what he `` saw '' . it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film . one farther word - the flight to the ford sequence , in my opinion , is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid . bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment , and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build . bakshi 's artistic ability and tolkien 's incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled . the recent dvd release ( 2001 ) by warner brothers , is sorely lacking . while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format , the package is woefully short of extras . how glorious it would have been to have had a director 's commentary , been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release . another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over . also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film . this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score . of course , the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made . we will never be able to see bakshi 's interpretation of gondor , of shelob , of faramir , of the cracks of doom , of eowyn 's battle with the witch king or gandalf 's confrontation with him . we will never be graced with bakshi 's image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead . it is a shame beyond all shames that we will , in the end , have to accept peter jackson 's glitz and glitter hollywood , action film version of these later events in tolkien 's masterpiece , but , i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all . david
you can debate prince 's acting talent , or even his choice to parody his own life in this film . there is no debate about his musical talent either then or now . he seems like a shadowy has-been twenty years later , but the music remains relevant and fantastic . having lived through the hype of this movie ( graduated high school in'85 ) i can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time . from tipper gore ( al 's wife ) trying to censor `` little nikki '' and every thing else under the sun via the pmrc ( parents music resource center ) to every `` air band '' at the time impersonating prince , it was the absolute hottest thing out . for a few weeks at least , prince was bigger than madonna and michael jackson . we all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered . it did n't disappoint . everyone was caught up . i was an mtv junkie at the time ( they actually played music then .... all the time ) prince played at least once or twice an hour . i must qualify this commentary by saying that , at that time , my favorites were billy idol , oingo boingo , the fixx , flock of seagulls and others in the punk/ new wave genre ' the music of prince at the time transcended all types and styles . one of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was soooooooo big then . all the things that remind you of the 80 's were iconic then . it was mainstream and it seems like a cliché ' now . it got so popular that it became ridiculous . it 's like the rappin ' granny commercial for wendy 's hamburgers . it looks stupid now because everyone was caught up in it ( sadly , kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something . anyway , i hope this gave you all a little insight .
this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the cameroon . the `` sisters '' in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully prosecuted husbands for abusive treatment of their spouses and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim council . it is rather long -- about two hours -- but fascinating in terms both of the individual plaintiffs and defendants and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms presided over by female judges . it will leave you , as it left me , with many questions about exactly how this change occurred . how and when did women come to occupy positions of authority in the cameroon ? have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their spouses ? was the granting of a divorce by a muslim court , against the express wishes of the husband , a one time event ? i 'm not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions . they made the movie two years ago , not yesterday . and the movie they made deserves a wide audience .
trawling through the sci fi weeklies section of the local video rentals store i was losing hope of finding any good movies i had n't yet seen . renting cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse . my son is so jaded with current `` b '' science fiction that he has n't bothered seeing this yet . it must be noted i did n't see anything about cypher when it was released in australia . it must have been very quiet or i just missed it . well this was a really pleasant surprise ! this is also no b movie . it 's not a `` blockbuster '' of the epic variety and does n't try to be - more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it 's plot to be fully savoured . the special effects are powerfully presented when they are used - my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously cgi at first view , but they get it right at it 's 2nd appearance , & that aside everything else is top notch . in any case the affects are secondary . i wo n't give anything away about the plot . the plot structure has a russian doll aspect a little reminiscent of basic instinct ( though with very different content ) . just i will say that choosing jeremy northam for the lead was a master stroke . the actor was born in cambridge england , and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced new england dialect , it 's a tad off key . see the final twist of the plot and you 'll see why that is such a brilliant choice ! and lucy liu is also just right with her `` will she kiss me - will she shoot me '' edge . i rarely watch movies several times within days - this is one of them .
george cukor directs a brooding and cynical classic . the distinctive ronald coleman is at his best in this piece of noir about an actor who loses himself in his roles . the acclaimed anthony john ( colman ) has driven his wife brita ( signe hasso ) away with his highly fueled temper and erratic behavior . but the two manage to continue working together to please their audiences . things begin to change as john is becoming bored with his career ; he reluctantly agrees to play othello . he gets deep into character as a jealous and murderous man . he begins walking a thin line between illusion and reality and ends up confusing his role with his own life and eventually kills his mistress ( shelley winters ) , but has no memory of the dastardly deed . colman seems faultless in this role . winters is very impressive as the young woman determined to get away from her squalid life . also in the cast : edmond o'brien , ray collins , joe sawyer and whit bissell .

this is one of my favorite films of all time . i read the book and liked it , but this movie expands on everything the book made famous . the acting is fantastic , especially from jon voight , who plays mr. sir , a very evil character . this film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout , until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending . i also love the way this is directed , by flashing back and forth between the modern day and stanley 's ancestors ' stories . the story was written by louis sachar , yes , but it seems that this story is made for film , and andrew davis does a great job directing it . i definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies .
with all of the films of recent , dealing with the british monarchy , is it really time for another ? answer : you bet ! the young victoria is another contribution to the wave of cinema from britain dealing with the royal family . in this case , it deals with the early life of princess victoria , and events leading up to the coronation of her becoming queen of all england , as well as her romance & eventual wedding to prince albert . the film also deals with the tempestuous lives & careers of both england 's queen & prince , as well as several other events that transpire ( political turmoil , etc. ) . emily blunt plays a radiant victoria in her youth , while rupert friend is her beloved & best friend , prince albert . the rest of the cast is rounded out with the likes of miranda richardson , as the dutchess of kent , and the always welcome on screen , jim broadbent as king william , as well as a cast of others that shine on screen . jean marc vallee ( c.r.a.z.y. , loser love ) , directs from a winning screenplay by jullian fellowes ( vanity fair , gosford park , separate lies ) . i absolutely went out of my head over the film 's visual look ( by cinematographer hagen bogdansker ) , who gave each frame of film a painterly look ( with the help of production designer , patrice vermette ) , as well as some tight editing ( by jill bilcock & matt garner ) . what i also appreciated in fellowes ' script is the use of a game of chess , as a metaphor for some of the film 's political motivation ( the characters in the film move about like the pieces on a chess board ) . this is smart , well written , directed , filmed , edited & acted entertainment ( and enlightenment ) that makes for a well spent evening at the cinema . rated pg by the mpaa for a few scenes of sensuality , some brief violence ( a little bloody , although nothing too gory ) , a rude outburst of language , and some on screen smoking
i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out . since i had already seen the original , when i saw this on sci fi channel- i do n't know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi - i knew what it was within the first few minutes . since i like richard burgi as a character actor , i wanted to see how he would pull it off . the writers/producers etc , modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the `` aliens '' ( they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help ) using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the 90 's . maybe it added a bit of polish to the film , or not . this film . film ? this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did- the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place , although no resolution of the alien 's problem . i sort of remember that in this remake , the woman became rather hostile towards the burgi/alien- i think it could have ended better . but the ending is just the ending , and the yarn is a swell yarn , being of the basic 1958 science fiction pulp stock . many great science fiction stories were written in the 50 's and some of them even made it to film . this is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something . i rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50 's sci fi , this one came off well . i actually enjoyed this quite a bit . but if anyone really wants to see this story told well , i suggest the original 1958 version with tom tyron and gloria talbott , directed by gene fowler jr .
i have never commented on a film before . i watched this movie with my girlfriend last night . i 've read comments saying this movie stays with you . it does . it 's been almost 24 hours and i am still completely affected . this movie left me questioning my own self . how can i possibly compare myself to a character such as ben who is totally selfless . i loved this movie . i love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end . i feel two emotions predominantly , happiness and sadness . an amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too . i so wanted ben and emily to be together , but in the end , they were , forever . if you have n't seen this movie , get it and watch it . just make sure you have no distractions . you 'll want to see every nuance in this picture . one for my library .
a wonderfully quirky film with enough twists for a sack of pretzels . parker posey plays fay grim as a sexy , vulnerable , loving mother who may or may not be what she seems . the story is very tongue in cheek , and the dialog skillfully understated . hints of humor and intrigue , neither of which overpower the characterization posey pulls off so well . the supporting cast is stellar . the downside ? this film needs your full attention , almost to the point of stopping the film and taking notes . posey has more sex appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses have in their entire body . she 's worth your time , even if you do n't understand the denouement .
i got this movie from netflix after a long waiting time , so i was anticipating it greatly when it arrived . my worst fears were that it would be plodding , as well as ... well , you know what all the screaming fan girls were babbling about ? gacktnhyde=hawt yaoi love ? that sort of thing ? dreading it . i was very , very pleasantly surprised . the movie was surprisingly watchable , even if the filming and music did make it feel like someone was going to bust out a pair of nun-chucks every two scenes , and the acting on gackt 's part was quite good . hyde , being , um , hyde , acted as a quasi-romantic friend/gang member character that anyone who saw him on stage would hardly be surprised by . he 's one of my two major beefs with the film itself . but the rest of the cast ( including the child actors in the opening scene ) were very good at doing what they did- which was , mostly , get shot at and yelled at . but my second problem was very minor , having to do with the goriness . it seemed way too suspense-horror to me- like every scene where someone is shot they either slump over , really most sincerely dead , or lay there burbling for a rather long time . but sho just ... takes the shots , repeatedly , keels over , bubbles a lot while he talks , and makes hyde cry . all in all , if you 're a fan of any of the actors or just a j-film fan , it 's definitely worth a watch .
'' the 40 year old virgin '' 'made me laugh a lot . i do n't care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy , i just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie . steve carell is perfect as the virgin nerd andy stitzer and i think the scene where andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest , specially because it is real . many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous , by the way . andy stitzer has a peaceful life . he is a little bit strange and collects lots of toys , but seems harmless . one day , while playing poker with his friends of his work , they discover that andy is in fact ... virgin ! and he is already 40 years old ! after this surprising revelation , all his friends are trying to make andy sleep with a woman ... the problem is the confusions in which andy gets in , specially now that he is really starting to like trish , a woman he met when she was buying a dvd player in the store he works at .
wow , finally jim carrey has returned from the died . this movie had me laughing and crying . it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from . jeniffer aniston was great , she will finally have a hit movie under her belt . if you liked liar liar you will love this movie . i give it 9/10 .
this amazing oscar winner ( 4 in total ) and john ford 's first academy award winner , is simply spellbinding with a pounding score by max steiner . called an art film , because ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and retribution , and greed and stupidity . but what makes this movie such a classic , is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting , that was so different from the usual american film , and more in the tradition of german expressionism . and the oscar winning performance by victor mclaglen as the drunken gypo is simply unbelievable . basically the movie takes place in ireland , and gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to the english to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend . but having all that money , he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away , while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer . the whole movie is one night in a dark and foggy ireland , and a cast of characters that are memorable but all along , the whole world of gypo is closing in on him , both psychologically . if i had to pick maybe three directors to have all their movies on a deserted island forever , and nobody elses , john ford would certainly be one of them . what a truly remarkable movie ...
the first of two films by johnny to , this film won many awards , but none so prestigious as a cannes golden palm nomination . the triad elects their leader , but it is far from democratic with the behind the scenes machinations . tony leung ka fai ( zhou yu 's train , ashes of time redux ) is big d , who plans to take the baton no matter what it takes , even if it means a war . well , war is not going to happen as that is bad for business . big d will change his tune or ... good performances by simon yam , louis koo and ka tung lam ( infernal affairs i & iii ) , along with tony leung ka fai . whether masons , made men in the mafia , or members of the wo sing society , the ceremonies are the same ; fascinating to watch . to be continued ...
when an actor has to play the role of an actor , fictional or factual , the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role . in a double life , ronald coleman surpassed himself as anthony john , the tortured double personality . he put into that character all his talent and sincerity . the facial expressions , mannerisms , gait and stance spoke eloquently of what anthony john was going through while playing othello on stage . coleman also did extremely well as a shakespearean actor in those short scenes as othello that were part of this gem of a movie . closups of coleman 's face as othello tortured by doubts about the fidelity of desdemona were in themselves scenes worth watching.add to that , his character 's off stage desperation and only someone with coleman 's depth of acting perception can achieve . it was like watching spenser tracy as dr. jekyll and mr. hyde , except this double role was much more profound and poignant . shelly winters looked so sweet , vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie . it is believed that ronald coleman liked his role in this film above all others he played and went on to win the oscar for best actor in 1947 . i would see this movie repeatedly and never feel bored .
i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it . it 's beautifully filmed and the story keeps one riveted for the entire time . it 's difficult to believe this was made in 1946 , as the tale is still fresh today , and really makes one think . i 'm not very knowledgeable regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made . in addition , the acting is superb , and the use of english and american actors quite astounding . i recently purchased the dvd so now i 'm able to watch whenever i wish . i highly recommend anyone interested in post-war british films to watch this .
'ned kelly ' is a wonderfully made australian film honouring a true australian hero . we are taken into the world of ned , his best friend , joe byrne , and the other members of the kelly gang , as the film explains and perhaps justifies ned 's actions . there is an exceptional cast present , who all give stellar performances , which brings the film to life . ( great job , heath ! ) orlando bloom was fantastic as joe , playing the role of quiet , loyal ladiesman very well . i was swept up in the moment . for a moment i almost believed the gang would win the battle at glenrowan , alas , it was not to be . some aspects of the film are fictional , and as an avid ned kelly fan ( and supporter ) , was slightly disappointed by this . perhaps also the film could 've gone longer , to cover more of the kelly gang's/ned 's life - i felt not enough was covered . regardless of a few flaws , this is a moving film , which stirs all sorts of emotions . ( and hey , i 'd assume this film would be better to watch rather than mick jagger trying to portray ned ... )
the synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect . it 's a very good thriller . well shot . tough to believe it was bill paxton 's directorial debut , though some shots do look exactly like a storyboard version . still , there are a few shots that really look good and show some real imagination on the part of paxton . it 's a solid story with some great twists at the end , several of them , all believable , all fun , and best of all , obscured well enough to make them true twists . the child actors in the movie do a great , too . i 'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as nickelodeon rejects , but both these kids do a good job . this movie is not gory . it 's not very scary . but it is very , very creepy .
